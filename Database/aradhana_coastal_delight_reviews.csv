portion was half hardly any gravy

"Squid was too chewy
Prawns ghee roast should be named prawns red chilli burnt with the amount of red chilly in it and burnt smell.
Chicken ghee roast has the same masala as prawns which was terrible.

Ironically mutton pepper fry has the same ghee roast masala aswell.


P.S I HAD TO ADD THIS THE OILD OR GHEE WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS USED GAVE ME HEART BUTNS AFTER SOMETIME OF EATING IT.
Terrible food!!!"

"Very seldom we get good soft well cooked mutton, and I was impressed with this place serving such delicious soft well marinated and good mutton Sukka. Next time

Chappati was too too good , soft and well cooked with perfect oil/ghee."
"what i ordered today was completely different from what I was served live in the restaurant, instead of prawns biryani it was masala rice , can't call it a Biryani, banga was not fresh and no value for money .. disappointed.."
please increase gravy quantity
All spilled can’t eat or remove from pkt

bad taste
zomato Delivered the wrong meal!! i got a meal from Home Plate instead of Arandhana
Was very disappointed as there were only 4 pieces of small size prawns

"Good place to visit that nearby station area... They can certainly improve the size of the bhakri and try putting fish even in the fish curry which is served in Thali... Bombil fry, surmai and pomfret were too good! Also during summer I guess they are giving a complimentary welcome drink which is Aam Panna..."
Too salty

Only the coconut green chutney ws stale

improve ur food taste my money got wasted
"The chutney was whole spoiled
Try to deliver the good food as you charge from us"

Fair
Pomfret thali had a stale pomfret and they replaced it with Bombil fry which was also stale. Their standards have really dropped. However the prawns and squid was very good.
"the food was pathetic.
they call themselves a costal delight restaurant and doesnt know how to cook fish.
they seem to have no salt in their kitchen.
ordering from them was a big mistake and will never repeat this again. feel bad for the fish being wasted by their pathetic chefs."
Good Delivery

pathetic packing dnt even know if some has eaten from my parcel......
"This restaurant is just outside khar station , it has a seating capacity of around 55-60 guests upstairs and downstairs.

We ordered

1 bombil fry
1 crab thali
1 surmai thali

Kokam juice was on the house.

Damages to the pocket - Rs 1185 inclusive of 5% gst. (Approx US $ 15.7)

Overall experience - taste was average , decent portions , good service . I would rate this place 2.5 on 5"
size is very small as per rate
