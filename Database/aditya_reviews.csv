Review
Flavourless food and slow service with careless attitude.
"Service and food quality is pathetic . Prepared cold dishes served . Even despite mentioning they hardly listen. Mannerless and do not know how to speak with customers , it‚Äôs like doing a favor to the customer . Roomali papad was stale and when asked to take back just refused . In fact was told this is the best in town . Fish tikka was stale and cold served. Discrepancies in billing and even the food parcel was never handed over . (Although we forgot to ask due to dispute raised and conversing with the manager ) pathetic . Would never visit and recommend not to visit and spoil your evening with family and friends . Its now more like a typical bar and restaurant joint than to a...read more"

Very less quantity. I ordered chicken tikka but the gravy and chicken pieces looked like any regular dish.
"Ordered full tandoori. First time in 3 decades that I encountered chicken tandoori pieces having more bones than meat. Pieces given did not have proper breast cuts, legs were as small as frog legs. Bad experience. Only plus point was the taste."

The quality of chicken was not good. It was not properly cooked.
"I was there with family to celebrate Birthday, however it was a disastrous when incorrect orders started coming on table. First a fruit punch was delivered at table when a hard drink was ordered. Later we order chicken malwani (post confirming its medium spicy gravy item), however some kind of sweet tasting chicken masala was brought, worst was that the staff was not at all apologetic, instead they said ""we gave u 10% discount na"""
Ordered was delivered very late although food was very tasty. had ordered veg .but quantity is less .
lollipop was very oily and heavily coated. seems to be change of the chef. else their food is always delicious
I had asked for butter naan. but plain naan was delivered.
chicken handi not spicy it taste like butter chicken
Schezwan was good in taste but food packing was really bad.
see how this. i really despondent with this order. it's not wort rupees 288. on this lockdown situation hotel are getting more benifit like this. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
No paneer pieces in the dish. The taste was horrible. I literally had to throw the biryani.
vegetables were not cooked well....first time not satisfied

"Loved every bite!! Delicious food, enormous portions! Good value for money! Must visit.."
It was great dining here...food is so fresh u can just feel it on your taste buds...coupled with a very friendly staff with amazing hospitality... Overall an awesome experience
Visited the place for quick dinner. Disappointed. Tried butter chicken and murg mussalam. Both the dishes were a cry. Waste of money. Items are priced higher for the quality they serve. Not much focus on ambiance. Service too is a far cry.
"They serve mughlai and chinese food along with a few other delicacies. Not a place that counts for its ambiance. Ambiance is dull and nothing good to write about it. Food is however ok, if not good. Tandoori chicken is decent and perfectly grilled."
My first home delivery order through Aditya restaurant via zomato. Have known aditya for a long time and know its food quality but was really dissappointed with the chewy chicken in their butter chicken that i ordered. The gravy taste was simply good but the chewy chicken marred the quality of the dish. It was listed in their best seller so ordered it but i think they should really have a check on this matter
"Even after flagging the issue (two different gravies are same) to Manager Madhavan, he did not bother to consider! Though they call themselves fine dine and charge also like fine dine but preparation for all non-veg are almost same! I would never recommend anyone for North Indian food!"
Amazing place !! The food is amazing. Chicken tandoori lolipop is my favourite. The service is amazing. The mocktails they serve are amazing. Overall i had a great experience.
"The ordered quantity of food is always too low. Any single item bought was never for even two persons
Only huge gravy with a tiny quantity of main ingradient
We ordered tandoori chicken lolypop but instead of tandoor, fried lolypop wad delivered. Mushroom tikka, only single person could eat. Praws masala, only 6 pieces in heavy gravy. What we pay is just for home delivery and masala gravy"
"Remind me of a time 20 years back. While it serves everything that a modern restaurant serves somehow I wouldn't recommend it too very much youngsters.

However the staff is super sweet and I really like how they have formed the menu.

I had tried basic Indian dishes but they were average. Definitely will be visiting again just to give it another go"
"Cant give anything below the it... Tasteless food with poor service given... I ordered
Chicken manchow soup which tasted like a clear soup which tasted worse than clear...
Chicken lollipop looked like chicken nuggets nd dint tasted like a lollipop...
Paneer chilly was good but not upto the mark...
Chicken Cheese kebab was more of cheese nd less of chicken... Which made it very salty in taste...
Garlic bread is worth trying...
Last but not the least do try shezwan sauce... Loved it..."
"Staff did not have the courtesy to change the dish when we stated it‚Äôs not the dish we asked for. ( Chicken Manchow Soup). Staff can‚Äôt even wait unless we tell our complete order. Really bad experience. Bad staff, worst taste of food, no manners and garlic bread looked like maska butter. I wish there was minus rating."
"There is no option for a negative rating. The service provided was pathetic. Chicken soup with no taste, chicken lollipop with came after 1 hour, chicken kabab with tooooo much cheese, the list is never ending. There good restaurants in Chembur please don‚Äôt choose this one."
Write the crispy chicken and chicken manchow soup you will enjoy it so much you will go for again and again. Also definitely e set outside in the outside area as you will enjoy more
"Located in Chembur Aditya is is a decent place where you get good fish and a nice meal if you are not very choosy about what you eat.

We had called for some gravy starters and main course and really liked the overall food. However I really think we need to improve on on quantity."
Aditya is one of my favourite restaurant in Chembur. Few near ago its use to be near Sindhi society and after that is got shifted to Basant park near cubic mall. It's has good abience and friendly staff. Best place to visit with family and friends.
"Shocking and Worst experience ever! On what basis do u consider yourself as a brand for providing good food when you can't even respect your guests who come with their family with kids and senior citizens? Didn't expect this for Aditya at all.
Kept us waiting for long even after telling them to clean the table thrice, me and my family were standing on the footpath despite staff being available. Once we sat, No courtesy to provide water. After asking for water for almost five to six times he didnt bother to come. Soup was cold. We had to literally cancel our entire order bcoz of the management casual behavior towards us. And the hotel wasn't even over crowded that they very busy which lead...read more"
Awesome place. Good staff. Lovely food. Parking easily available. Clean place and management is coperative. Keep it up. All the best guys. Rock it
It's a very delicious restruant and had a good and best services for customer it's can create a good will off a restaurant and other customers like to came to your restaurant
"Bad food, bad ambience and pathetic service ! The air conditioning is more pathetic ! Never come to this place ! Will never recommend to anyone !"
"Have been hearing about this place for ordering food for quite sometime and yesterday evening was the time finally I ordered food from here.
It was very disappointing and I ordered two veggies for two ppl just to play safe ! To my experience both paneer tikka masala and sabzi kofta were absolutely taste free!
Will not recommend to anyone üòï"
