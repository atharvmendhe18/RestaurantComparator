"CHICKEN SHAWAI : A MUST TRY IN STARTERS !!

Trust me guys, you'll get addicted to it. The chicken is super tender and delicious. Totally fell in love with this arabic grilled chicken starter the day I first had it at Afra. Kudos to the restaurant, you guys should definitely aim for more outlets all over Mumbai and make more people taste this superb starter. Tandoori chicken has become boring now, your chicken shawai can be the new favourite of Mumbaikars."

"The chickens we've tried were all marinated very well. They turned out tender and not over done!

The pita bread deserves a special mention since it was thick and textured.

Frisbees is now inside the same premise so that is a bigger plus!

Afra recommendations: Reshmi Chicken Kebab, Al Faham, Shawai with lots of Pita breads!"

The sawai taste really exceptional.. I was not aware something like this is served so nearby me.. I would love to taste the Al faham as well.. Thanks..
"If you are a hardcore non-vegetarian then this is a place you‚Äôll like. Shawai Chicken, which comes with Mayonnaise and Pita Bread is a very nice and also little sweet,
Grilled Chicken delicacy which should be tried for sure."
I used to love Al Shawai prepared at Afra Mughalo but lately whenever I order it I was getting less quantity of chicken. Today they stunned me with a quarter chicken even though I had order half chicken Al Shawai. Really disappointed and I feel cheated ordering from Afra Mughlai. Would never recommend it to anyone. Pathetic experience.

Beautifully decorated
Cool atmosphere
Nicely flurish
Good quality services
Love the food quality
Good service
Hope to see this services ahead"

If your fix is biryani or Pulao this is a good place to try it. Had their biryanis and they are fine. I‚Äôd recommend the Mutton Pulao. Nice flavour and finely spiced.
