"The portion is less as compared to original
The order which i received is a pulav (veg biryani) and not chicken biryani"
We went for dinner in this hotel but after eating the chicken we left the hotel without having dinner we just had the starters and didn't order the main course. Their chicken was smelling so bad... fresh chicken is always white but this was brown and black which was stale. Waiters don't serve you water unless and until you tell them to. This was the worst experience ever. The dishes are so costly. We ordered 3 chinese dishes in starter all the dishes were having fennel seeds in them. Who puts fennel seeds in chinese dishes?We went to another hotel to have the main course which was very awesome than this hotel.
they took 1 hr just to prepare manchow soup.. very bad service.. waiters and manager's are arrogant.. if you want very very very bad experience please do visit the pathetic restorant..
"Taste of veg food items is not upto the mark. Don't buy mocktails here. Nonveg food is tasty. Starters veg nonveg both are good. Ambience is nice. Service is good. Though it's a bar, the crowd is sober so good for family."
"Overall experience was bad.
It spoiled the Sunday evening.
Food delivery came very late. Despite restaurant being 300 meters away. Also, food was not upto the expectation at all."
wrong sabji delivered. very bad experience. i will never from here again.

"The chicken pulav was sweet and there were fruits on the pulav , which made it even more sweeter ."
"Thane's first aeroplane theme, this place is beautifully decorated with in-flight vibes. Food and service is good. They have some good variety of Kebabs and curries."
Food taste is really good. One should try their mocktailsüòç quality food with ambience. Evn portion they serve is also satisfying. Highly recommendable.
Had ordered Chicken Crispy from this place. It was decent. The quantity was good. The dish had an authentic Chinese taste to it. The chicken pieces had stayed crisp even during delivery. They had given Schezwan Sauce as accompaniment.
"First they serve cold & bland food, then the management won't own up & take responsibility? Pathetic experience"
""
Overly priced for small quantity of soup served.

""
Too spicy and rice was also uncooked

"Ordered cream of chicken soup
It was the worst soup I ever tasted."
there was cockroaches in items. pathetic and disgusting from this restaurant worst experience ever. Charging so high and not able to provide hygiene food.
"The ambiance is made totally like an Aeroplane you literally feel like you are in the Aeroplane. ‚úàÔ∏è
So we ordered chicken noodle soup üçú
And masla papad and Kolhapuri Chicken
My fav was Kolhapuri Chicken with roti where delicious in taste must try 9/10
And the negative point was no Desert in the restaurant üòÇ .
Over all a good experience in the Aeroplane come restaurant."
"First time in Abhiman Restaurant and It‚Äôs the amazing spot with amazing food. The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience.
Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great."
"Veg Fried Rice - It was stale , salt was less, and it had a very weird and foul smell. We asked the staff to check they , they were like it was okay only salt is litty rest all is fine, they didn't change so it was loss for us


We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala with Butter Naan , It was delicious and quantity was good , it went well with naan.
Paneer Dragon - We ordered this for starter and it was spicy , quantity was good.

We were really excited to visit this place because of its ambience, the theme is really cool and super amazing! Loved the ambience, lighting is good and the vibes are just perfect to spend some quality time with friends and family.

But Staff here is not friendly...read more"
"ABHIMNA BAR ND RESTAURANT HAS. A AUTHENTIC TASTE ND AMBIENCE IT GIVES YOU AN EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A LUNCH OR DINNER IN FLIGHT LIKE SEATS ND ALL R MADE AS SAME AS IN A FLIGHTS

SERVICE IS GOOD OVER THERE ND ALL THE HYGIENE CARE ARE TAKEN .
DINNING WITH FAMILY WOULD BE BEST EXPERIENCE
COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN ALSO HAVE ENJOYMENTS
MOSTLY I LIKED IS AMBIENCE ."
Nice restaurant. Yummy food. Only if they improve food quality a little and dont make people to wait for food long they would be better
Havent been here in a long time. The place always used to be full and had to wait for seating. Had good quality food. The innovative thing is their ambience. It is made like a flight from inside. Even they have built windows like flight inside and stickers of sky in it. Innovative concept and will especially be attractive for children.
Bestt bestt place in thane to visit its in khopat and you ll reallyy luvvvv there theme it ll give u a real flight wali feel staff are also polite ll suggest u to try there non veg menu i luvedd it...
"This restaurant is situated at khopat in thane west..What i liked the most is the ambienece..The ambience of the restaurant is pretty cool..U get the feeling that you are really in a aeroplane
THE food is amazing..The charpa rice was very amazing and tasty..The panner chili was also very good..üòç"
Charges 45 inr for a 300 ml cold drink glass bottle which costs 20 inr
This restaurant was suggested by my friend and I just love this placeüòç food was amazing.. and I would love to visit here again.

This restaurant was suggested to me by my friend for nicely themed ambience and quality of food. I have been here twice before reviewing. One of my favorite dish here is crispy chicken which tastes delicious üòã.
"Although the service staff was prompt and polite , the food was disappointing on a totally different level , We'd ordered - Mutton Tawa , butter chicken, chicked tangy toop( staff recommended) and a couple of other starters . Taste wise i have had much better food at much better prices. I have visited so many restaurants in Thane but I could never find a decent mutton dish anywhere including here and also for some reason the mutton tawa had more capsicum than mutton...the butter chicken was equally bland and the starters were not good either..."
"1. Good restaurant for both Veg and Non Veg
2. Food Quality and Quantity is good
3. We went there to enjoy the flight structure ambiences but uncomfortable they closed 3 pm
4. Fair price , GST is the only concern
5. Near to shopping mall
6. Overall good place"

"We wet there for lunch. The seatings here are similiar to an airplane seats which is quite different from any regular restaurant.
We tried Chicken Dragon in the starters which was quite tasty. The chicken was juicy and fresh. It was spicy, loaded with veggies and jus like expected.
We ate Chicken Tikka biryani for the main course which they said was the best in biryani section. However, the taste was not that great but yes it was yumm.
However, the staff is a little ignorant towards their customers. They need to be a lil more polite and enthusiastic towards their customers.
Altogehter, a good place to fulfill your taste buds cravings."
I visited abhiman... Thay had this aeroplane theme interiors which is very nice.. Food was also good and they had a friendly environment üòã
Best place to visit in Thane. Ambience is very good. As you feel like you are in Flight. As well service is also good. Blueberry mojito & muskmelon sangria is awesome. As well Fried Rice is also good enough. I enjoyed as well Restro bar is good.
"Abhimaan a famous old restaurant in Thane, we had1] Butter chicken- Mildly spiced and not so well-cooked chicken, The taste was average and the taste of the chicken was all lost in extra butter could be better.
2] Abhiman special soup-This soup is much better than other Chinese regular soups lots of chicken and cheese and when filled with crispy noodles makes it a treat.
We had 2 dishes one was average other delicious will visit again for a major food brunch. Cheers"
"So i visited this hotel Abhiman in khopat right next to the eastern express highway. They had this aeroplane themed interiors which was fascinating. The food was excellent and they had a friendly environment. O ordered chicken pahadi kabab, chatpata kabab, mutton sukkha with roti and chicken tikka biryani. Please note they also serve unlimited complementary."
Awesome Ambience. Have been regular customer in this restaurant. Good food. Sea food and chicken dishes were fabulous. Good Music. Would recommend to my friends.
"It has the unique interior ambience. It is nicely mented as as a plane and looks attractive.

The food I ate here was Veg hakka noodles. Normally I don't prefer eating veg. But this was the best veg noodles I have ever ate. Too good.

Cheersüëçüèº"

"Nice atmosphere .. Good and delicious food chicken lapeta , Murg mussllm dishes are too finger licking ... Service also good ... Good staff must try"
This is the perfect place for dinner . Their outlet is really beautiful . It gives a feel of sitting in aeroplane . Various biryanis I have tried and all of them are really delicious . The waiter's are good at providing service.
We tried these 2 dishes paneer dragon & chicken chatpata both dishes were delicious & tempting ambience was too good feels like just came from a airplane journey must visit place
Food Quality is Average. Ambience is also good. But the intresting thing is service of restaurant and staff is arrogant especially Manager Of airplane Section .
"Its a nice place they a theme of an aeroplane the food is good.
It's good place for teenagers to hangout as well as for family.
The didn't like the biryani here.
The main course was fabulous

RATINGS:-4.3"
"A good restaurant. The restaurant has a normal place to sit as well as a part where An aeroplane themed ambience has been created.
They could have done better but still a good place to go for a change.
We ordered Punjabi dishes üòã the taste and quality was good... quantity too was filling...
A good place for a family get together üòÑ"
"This one of the hotels where you go for a experience. It's actually shaped like a aeroplane and I am kidding you not.thd place is well lit and great ambience. The staff is courteous and very professional and polite.

We order the following

Veg Hara bhara kabab 4/5
Chicken tandoori 4/5
Roti ki tokri 5/5
Chicken mughlai 5/5

The best part is value for money. Qty is awersome and easily can be shared with others. Place is also available for birthday celebrations."
"Ambience 4/5
Food 1/5
Service 4/5
Value for money 3/5

Ambience was good, flight theme restaurant. Food was not at all tasty. Staff served very well."
"Visited this aeroplane themed restaurant recently.

From outside u might not be able to make out anything about the theme but it is nicely made from inside.

Cosy and comfortable airplane kinda sitting is the highlight.

The food here is good.Also the quantity is enough as compared to the price.

We had Chicken chilly, Chicken tandoori and Butter chicken. The chicken was tender soft and fresh. Overall a nice experience."
"Stepped in for a quick bite and was out immediately. The chicken 65 was filled with fat and oozing of oil. Less chicken and more chicken skin. Way way unhealthy. Wouldn't recommend this type of food being given to customers using substandard, unhealthy material. Just not done. Not the same place as management has changed. Disappointing to see what is done to make profits."
"Worst service!
They dont even refill your empty glass for water. Afternoon they don't serve tandoori items as they don't have chef for that."
The person taking the order was completely lost. Mixed up the entire order. At last when we found a piece of foreign particle in the drink the manager didn't even bother to apologize for the same nor did anything about it.
"Perfect abience...food at reasonable price and it is quite good...good staff.üòâ
Dessert is perfect...kesar pista ice cream and dry fruits falooda will win ur heart.."
Great place to go with family and friends. Murgmasalam is must in non veg served with good portion of chicken in it ...chatpata veg is really nice üëå
"I was very excited to be here as this place is know for its ambience i.e. you feel like you are in an aeroplane

For starters:
Veg manchurian and paneer chilly

For main course:

The best thing about this place is the Ambiance. It's just a different dining experience that you get here. The food is just OK and the service is slow.
"I loved the ambience more than food. It's a good place to visit with your family and have experience like you are in a flight. Its a flight theme restaurant and its good to chill and relax while having food. I tried their paneer chilli and veg pot rice, both were just ok. I'm quitely disappointed with their service and food taste. It's a nice place to visit once in a while."
"I ordered Manchow soup from Abhimaan this afternoon and as you can see from the photos, I received soup with just Soya Sauce in it, no cabbage, green chillies, garlic. The color says it for itself.

The soup was also very cold, someone would just not wish to have it.

Upon calling the restaurant and requesting for refund, they informed to send a person to collect it but after 30 minutes on following up, I get to hear that they do not have anyone to collect it for today and instead they will send someone tomorrow with the soup. It was ridiculous and hillarious at the same time to hear that!

How can they not give customer service? To settle on, I instead requested for a credit note but he...read more"

ambience is definately something which may wanting you to visit this place..other than the ambience the food is good..n the quantity they serves is much more then expected..all n all single visit resto..!!
"Extremely poor service. Orders are served very late. Food quality and quantity both are good but the service ruined it all. The waiters don't pay attention. Ac wasn't working properly. The rating is only for the good food. We ordered veg crispy, paneer tikka masala and veg pulao. It is sufficient for 4 people. If you are a patient person then you might enjoy the food here. If not then please avoid this restaurant."
Worst staff they talk very arrogantly if u ask something about dishes I don't know why the staff are hired there. food is OK n Ac not working properly don't go there it's waste of precious Tym and money..
