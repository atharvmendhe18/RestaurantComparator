Uncooked noodles
There was no chicken piece in the chicken gravy . But there was manchurian two balls in the gravy . Why is that so?
I ordered chicken lollipop and chicken schezwan noodles. Quantity of noodles was good. It was medium spicy.

soup was too salty. rice was fine
They usually have very tasty food but this time the noodles were tasteless and the gravy was too!
