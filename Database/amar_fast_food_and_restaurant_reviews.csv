Review
Nice. Service is slow. I went there on Friday. I went there couple of times. We were alone in the resturant then also the service was slow. The arabita pasta in pink sauce was nice and of course the sizzling brownie is mouth wateringüëåüèªüëçüèª
"Most horrible and pathetic food. A paradigm change from what it used to be. Sudden closure of South Indian, Chat and Sandwich from menu list will be a huge dampener for Amar as only these were best made. Hope management understands what customers want."
Same Management as Amar Juice Center. Good Ambiance and nice staff. Valet Parking available. Location is nice. Full Veg Place. Delivery is quick and fast. Prices are reasonable
"Went on weekend with cousins....food is good...service is very good...u must visit atleast once.
Parking issues and n u won't find dis place easily."
"What they have done I fail to understand.
The entire taste has gone for a toss compared to their other outlets.
It's in a restaurant style which is probably the main advantage over the first Amar which is on the road near irla.
But other than this, there is nothing worth even mentioning. This is probably the lowest score and worst review I have ever written.
I took one pic and then didn't feel like even clicking any pics."
"Had gone for someones party. This restaurant is not upto its reputation! Amar juice center is much better than its counterpart. From soups to main course, everything had food color. Main course had color and soda. Not worth. Nothing to write."
"Fast service, Nice Ambiance and Good Staff with really tasty foodüòã Must try..It's near Andheri Station, Next to Parsi Dairy Farm..

So i had ordered for Cheese Pav Bhaji and Mexican Chilli Sizzler (i know it's a weird combination) The food came in no time, really quick..and trust me, it was deliciousüòã

The amount and quality of cheese on Pav Bhaji was good..
I loved the veggies served with sizzler: Zukini, Corn, Jalapenos, Caramalised Onion, Stuffed Capsicum and Tomato Stuffed with Cheese..French Fries were okay..They had an option of Rice/Spaghetti (Noodles)..I wish they served mushrooms too!
Though it was named Mexican ""Chilli"", the sauce they served wasn't spicy at...read more"
"Amazing restaurant in all manners a restaurant can be. The best thing is that it's pocket friendly. The food is very tasty.

We ordered 3 layered cheese pizza (don't remember the name exactly) , lasagna , farfelle italiano (don't judge if the spelling is wrong) , pav bhaji , cheese chili toast , veg crispy , hill road sunset (its a mocktail) . All of this was very tasty. Whatever you order here is delicious.

The ambience is also pretty good. A place where you can go with your family as well. A highly recommended place to visit. Coming back soon for more."
The Amar at Irla serves better food I feel even though this one has a much wider menu! The place is busy and made very well..ideal for quick lunches or dinners and service is great!
"Let me tell you the tale of the Dal Makhani that'd make a rossogula feel bitter and the pav that never came.
A group of chaddi-buddies went to this place after a hard day of college work. Being from North India, they wanted the original Dal Makhani, so they took an auto towards Andheri. Reached Amar Fast Food and suddenly had their expectations raised with the nice interiors and all. Excitedly ordered the Dal Makhani along with some buttery naans. The Dal Makhani was just too sweet, literally.  As an addition to the value of the very bad spent money, they ordered pav bhaji which felt like it came from the north pole, the last mistake they made that day was that they ordered an extra pav...read more"
"Have been twice to this place for dinner.
Ambience and service earn 5/5.
Liked their sizzlers !!!
Rather calling expensive i would say value for money.
An important note... Poor network coverage on basement."

"Great food...tried sizzlers...no doubt one of the best sizzlers I have had...they also serve additional sauce with the sizzlers...
Will recommend all the goodies to try this place at least once."
"The iconic amar fast food at irla has started expanding and this place is one of their outlet. Don't be misled by the name as it is more of a fine dine place. The ambience is very good and there is a small party hall in the basement area. Coming to the food ordered a masala uttapam. Service was fast..the uttapam was huge and tasted good too.
But what is truly exceptional and a must try here is their Kolkata paan ice cream.. Beats bachelors Paan ice cream hands down.
The pricing is a bit over the higher side. But the location and the ambience makes it a good place to visit frequently."
"One good and decent hotel that has opened up very close to station. Just decided to grab a bite here and it was a great choice. We ordered just simple mysore masala dosa and tomato onion uttapam. Both of the dishes had their unique tastes.
Also the staff there is very courteous and attentive..
Later I decided to order the Calcutta Paan Ice-cream and it was the ultimate choice.. never have I eaten such an amazing Paan icecream anywhere. I could just keep going to this place just for it.
Overall it's a great place to go with family as it's ambience is no less than a fine dining restaurant."
Have been here twice.. Mah frnds seem to like dis place a lott.. But mah opinion differs.. Not oh so good place.. So foodies like me who r lovers of food wudnt like it much.. Khana decent tha.. But woh maza nahi aya.. So yeah overol thik thak place.. Pocket friendly types.. Der r not many restaurants around toh yeah a place wich serves almost ol da cuisine is good only!
"Was happy when I came to know that Amar has started a new restaurant. :)

I went there with my friends on a Sunday. It was Jam packed !

We ordered Cheese Nachos, Paneer Chilly, Corn Cheese Balls and Pav Bhaji.

1) Nachos were crisp and it had some slices in it. The cheese sauce was thick and tasty. 4/5

2) Paneer Chilly was nice. But they Paneer wasn't so moist. 3/5

3) Corn Cheese Balls were delicious ! Crispy from outside and gooey from inside ! :D 5/5

4) Pav Bhaji is Amar's speciality. And they dint disappoint. Hot, bit spicy and tasty ! :) 4/5

Overall it was a great experience. This place is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The ambience is nice. Don't be surprised if you...read more"
"Nice, Decent & Fine dining kind of restaurant bang outside andheri west station. All stations need atleast one such restauarnt for that sudden date. What strikes about the place is ample parking & huge seating area inside yet that fine dine feel & not a fast food place. Staff is courteous. Food is worth relishing. Price is little on higher side but contrary to the name its not a fast food joint and more of a fine dine family restaurant. Try Paneer Kadhai, dts what I had ordered. And cheese naan.üòã"
"Have been visiting this place for almost past 6 months on all week ends. Nov 15 2015 was the worst experience so far. Lots of flies. Pathetic service standards. I guess their boss haven't paid either good bonus or the staff hasn't got leaves and that frustration they are showing on guests who have come to dine.

If the bosses are reading the reviews they should seriously act upon the same.

My table number was 12
Bill no 107
W. No 6"
Ambience is too good...d food is also yummy n nice...v tried d rumali papad wich ws too large...jain pav bhaji ws ok...sizzlers wer a delicacy...
"A family of six, we had visited this place for my birthday dinner yesterday. Here is my experience and ratings which stacked up while spending my evening here.

Ambience : The lower level in this restaurant hosts a party hall which is completely NOT sound proof. If there is a party, you are expected to forcefully hear those pathetic party noises which they play as songs. This severely limits the ability to strike a conversation with your loved ones over a dinner. You will literally shout on top of your voice to try and converse. No matter how much luxurious the hotel looks, the feel/noise made the entire experience negative. Horribly negative!!!

Ambience rating? Its a ZERO.

Have visited this place anytime that we want sure good food and are not ready for experimentation. The food here is always delightful - yummy, fresh, tasty, bountiful, steaming hot and served with a smile. There's nothing extra-ordinary about this place, except for the menu - which is widely varied, and surprisingly, the chef does justice to most dishes. It's a casual place with good interiors. Food is priced at a pocket friendly cost.

Must have's: pav bhaji, masala bun, fruit custard with jelly and ice cream, Faluda."
"This is one family restaurant which serves almost all cuisines from south Indian to Italian n from Punjabi to sizzlers... This place is fully air-conditioned n has a huge sitting area n some good big tables which can accommodate 12/15 ppl, so good for groups .... Now food part... Had manchow soup which was good n will surely recommend to have it here though it could have been more thicker.. Had cheese masala pav which was decent... Lasagne was nice ...

Clean and nice place to fill your stomach. It's often crowded and people do trust its quality and taste. I like palak dosa and frankie the most. Moreover this has been my dinner destination for every Friday evening since last 3 months.
"June 13 dinner: On a Saturday evening, we reached Amar's restaurant in Andheri at around 8.30 pm. We were lucky to get a place in 5 minutes as this restaurant can get full pretty quickly. For some who may not be aware, this place is owned by the same guys who run the Amar centre ahead of Mithibai college. So, the food quality is expected to be good. The interiors are good and gives a good feel and ambience to the place. As is their speciality, they have different types of pav bhajis. I went for the spl pav bhaji. It arrived within minutes with dollops of butter. The taste is as good as it has been over the years. Pani puri was as tasty. However, the nachos were not good. The nachos were...read more"
Hello this is new restro in borivali opp moksh plaza friends let me tell u one thing abt this that reatruant is good they have good quality we loved whatever we order but they have see the service that is lil bit dull so if they will give good service then i m sure in that area they will be having good business n they will have huge amount of customers...
"This has the appearance of a popular joint.
Very oily food, taste is smothered under all that grease. 
Service is good. Ambience is nothing outstanding.
Prices are pocket-friendly."
The food is absolutely great over here the quality and the quality is excellent a great family restaurants all the varieties of fruits. The Malai Kulfi is worth trying
"This is a new branch of Amar juice center.

In parle you have to stand and eat, here they have full fledged restaurant.

Taste is as expected very good, specially tawa pulav and biryanis.

Must try."
Been here just once ... nice ambience ... good pav bhaji and Chinese here is nice too i.e. fried rice was good ... service is fine ... overall ok place !!! The one at irla is better !!!
"Have been here like 5-6 times now.
In mocktails Melon Blast is what I always have..:P
Ordered Bruchetta , Hakka noodles & veggie delight pizza .
Italian food is what I personally like here...:P"
"Nice ambience and great taste... let it be punjabi or chinese or anything.. tried white risotto with vegetables, nachos, dry paneer manchurian etc... all were awesome... virgin mojito was good and chocotini was also nice.. worth going
In main course veg lahori is superb with butter kulch... also must try the cheese kurkuri starter.... very nice presentation."
It's My all time favorite! From the pani puri stall outside to north Indian food and sizzlers. I've tried it all. And every bite of it is worth it! It's a total family restaurant with great service! The entire staff there is friendly and at your service.
"Opening after the immense success of their stall near Irla, this restaurant is nowhere near a disappointment. Entering the place will make you feel like a royal diner, but it wont be much heavy on your pocket. It is a very huge place with a pretty good ambience, very good service, and no left out feeling even if the place is fully crowded. I ordered a pizza, a sizzler, a fresh lime soda and the staples. I must say, all of them were of a superior quality and quantity was decent. This place is a must try with your family. You won't come outside this restaurant with an empty stomach for sure."
"One our regular joints for amazing vegetarian food. As always the staff was courteous. Food was great. Definitely recommend spinach turnover, pav bhaji and baby corn and mushroom stir fry."
"Honestly speaking..opening of this resto made me think it would be a stall or a small resto like the present Amar juice near irla @parle east.... But its gr8 to experience it personally... A relatively huge restaurant.. Trust me... Ambiance can be a defining trend among the middle income people! Would have broken all its competition like Vridavan, shivsagar, RK..in terms of Ambiance and as well as food! The food is also way better than expected! The kurkure sticks! Burnt garlic! .. A newbie for Family outings üíöloved it.. Keep it up"
"Fast service. Good food. The waiting time is a lot if one visits it on weekends. Noisy and crowded too.
Reasonably priced. Pav bhaji, neer dosa and butter idli are a must try! Best I've ever had."
"If you are somehow connected to Western suburbs of Vile Parle or Andheri, you have probably heard about 'Amar Fast Food'. One of the oldest and popular chain of fast food here. The famous huge shop in Vile Parle, which is an delight for the late-night eaters and a Small stall like shop around Andheri Station. This is a full fledged restaurant near the small shop. 

Food
Nothing out of the ordinary here. North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, Continental and the Mumbai Chaat. Pav Bhaji and Masala Dosa are a 'must eat here.' Apart from that, you can also try the traditional north Indian curries and some Crispy vegetarian starters. Yes, it's a Vegetarian's paradise. If you want to try...read more"
The brand image of Amar continues...From the road side eatery at irla to a fancy restuarant..bullseye. The place is always crowded. The masala pav bhaji is to die for. The pani puri counter at the entrance is the start to the foodgasm which follows.
"Had heard a lot about sizzlers here and me being a sizzler fan had to try this place. It was good. But yeah iv had better. But really really impressed with other things i tried there. AMAZING pav bhaji and pav sandwhich. Must try. if your are here..and even if you are full you GOT TO have spinach overturn (paneer). Its going to be a treat to your tastebuds. Mocktails are pretty good. Over all indian food was pretty good. Fair enough value for money. Sizzlers were good too , can try. Food wise - delicious over and above all. Recomended :)"
"Hungry in the morning, noon, evening or late night.... And I mean late night, you will get food here. It's not just food, it's tasty fast food. Quick service and a wide selection from Indian to Continental food is available. Try the butter idli and Tawa pulao..... Also their juices are freshly prepared. Pav Bhaji is like an anytime meal here, specially at late nights. Sitting in your car and dining or on the boot of your car is the speciality."
"It was quite a long time that I wanted to be at this place. Finally, I made it with my close buddy. We had north Indian food with trying different types of rotis, kulchas and naans. The veggie was really good and fresh. I felt, this wasn't with food colours....resembling a good quality food."
"Perfect for a late night snack or if you have missed your dinner. The place usually stays open till pretty late post midnight. The dosas, idlis and utappams are pretty nice. They don't have a dine in so you have to either eat in your car or manage any other way. But pretty nice as it is one of the few options available pretty late in the night."
"If you are like me; crave for really good pav bhaji but don't like the idea of sitting on a roadside pavement, then head to Amar's newest outlet at Andheri west. Ample seating and nice furnishings but can get a bit too noisy on weekends.
Foodwise nothing to complain about. A1 pav bhaji, juices and fast food. Do try the pav sandwich... A bit salty but fabulous none the less. Tawa pulao is also a hit.
They have a multi cuisine menu unlike the Amar at Juhu meaning you can order Chinese, Sizzlers, continental (pizzas, pastas and risottos), North Indian as well as the usual South Indian, chats and pav bhaji.
Service wise needs to improve a bit as waiters seemed clueless on how to manage...read more"

Food is great.. I ordered veg biryani it was great in taste and also quantity was also good.. Service was good and ambience was good.. Overall good restaurant to go

Capacity is Huge.

Ppl who love to eat late night...tbis place is sutely a paradise for them..most of the items are decent...pav bhaji n dosas are amazing along with juices...masala pav is good too...heavy on pocket....service is little slow..

But this Amar is something diff. It's not like your regular one...
Certainly operated to be recognized as a new symbol of fine-dine...."

Service is very good.

"A casual fine dine restaurant of the world famous Amar Juice center of Irla had opened a while back, but never had an opportunity to visit the place.

Finally managed to visit, well done with space between tables and was pretty empty at 7 pm in the evening. 

We ordered an Aam Panna which was a tad sweet; virgin margarita which was outstanding; pani puri which was nothing worthwhile, with the pani being luke warm. I have an aversion to that. The bhel was decent, however inspite of asking thrice for spicy bhel, it was still medium.

A sada dosa which was crisp and crunchy at the side and soft in the centre, just perfect like Amar juice center; As was the Idli sambhar daal ke - in fact the...read more"

"2030 hours, 28th May 2015, Thursday, Andheri West:

The Prelude: 
=============
What everyone knows is that Amar Juice Centre has become iconic in Irla. What everyone doesn't know is that it is like the proverbial phoenix, literally rising from the ashes. From a pavement stall it has grown to become a chain of restaurants (handful so far, yet nevertheless) across Mumbai. The brand new addition to this is a plush Amar Fast Food and Restaurant located in an uber premium area, very close to Andheri station.

The Personality: 
================
There are some restaurants which penny pinch. Name-is-big-but-viewpoint-is-small kinds. Then there are some which offer you the best value for money....read more"
"A serene place. Peaceful family restaurant. Food is very good. Normal Indian we ordered - paneer, daal and roti. Service is decent. 
Can choose to dine in, when around Andheri west, with little plans to eat! :)"
"Amar Andheri is great family place to be, I got some coupons on groupon which gave me great deals, we had shashlik sizzlers which was very tasty, also Amar pavbhaji is yummy as always, we had Manchurian n manchaw soup as starter very tasty n soft, thin crust pizza was very tasty too.
Overall a great dining experience with reasonable prices. Must visit"
"If your hungry at night this is best place to find a quick bite.
. Tawa pulaav and bhaji rocks. Pizza, idli and dosa

Service is fast. Nice juices as well.

Always crowded on weekends."
"You're outside the station, waiting, hungry....
Now, you can either go to one the sidewalk stalls and take a quick bite, or, you can come to this exquisite place for 'just outside the station standards' and have a hearty, comfy meal.

Being a multicusine restaurant, they have an entire booklet of a menu. Pretty safe to say, you won't be short of choices.

Since we just wanted a nice meal to do away with the hunger pangs, we went for the classic lachha parantha and the chef's special paneer ki sabzi.

Not expecting much out of it, we did get a dose of the exquisite. The paneer was butter soft, and the gravy, little bit on the oilier side was an absolute delicacy. The lachha parantha...read more"

Food: We were recommended the
1. Veg. Handi - Spicy in good measures with perfect mixing of vegetables and gravy. But for the one who has literally lived on Punjabi sabzis for a decade, there is a lot of scope for improvement. Nevertheless, it was pretty good.

"Amar Juice Centre a household name for one of the finest pav bhaji and idli now opens a sit down dining place in andheri west ... Though the concept is yet super fast food it is a welcome relief to atleast have a sit down option in AC instead of standing on the road for a meal... However weekends might not be a good option to visit this place due to the long waiting ...

Food as usual is very good ... Worth having Pav Bhaji , Pav Sandwich, Idli , pizza ( surprisingly good ) , paneer makhmali roll , fresh fruit juices etc ....

I have yet to come across something that was not worth having at this place ...."
"One of the best fast food places...quick service...the pav bhaji and pulav here is just a treat to the taste buds !!
Another good thing is hat it is close to the station."
"This place is located near the busy streets of andheri. This restaurant is also as busy as the streets. On a Monday night also we had to wait for half an hour for a table. The variety they offer is stupendous. The food ranging from pastas to pizzas to sizzlers to a mere medu wada will make sure that you visit it again.
Ps- Go with an empty stomach to terminate all your cravings for all the cuisines"
"One of the best fast foods of late that we've dined in. Pretty good quality food and that too with good quantity. It was heartening to see bhaji of pav bhaji arrive in the biggest compartment of the plate, after ages. Almost all the other places serve the bhaji in the compartment besides the onion one and pavs kept in the biggest compartment. The place is huge especially the basement and still it has waiting on the weekends. Service is pretty quick as well...all in all a paradise for only veg foodies...it made our day or rather evening...should put up a screen also for ipl score or other stuff people can be abreast of."

Apart from the pav bhaji that it has to offer.. A mini version of it.. In the form of masala pav is worth exploring.. Only issue that it has is of seats availability.. But that too is sorted once its beyond 10 pm.. And you can enjoy hot food.. With cold open windy night !
Went there for sunday brunch. Starters were not up to the mark both quality and quantity . They have amazing briyani and lovely desserts . A little steep on the pocket but the ambience is good and staff is polite but slow . Overall the experience was average.
Tucked away in back of a building. Barely even visible from s v road. Good seating. Also available for party. For food i felt parla joint is way better. Service is decent
I attended a party here lately. The hall was good for around 50 people. Ambience was good. Food was not that tasty as I had heard earlier about this food joint.
"Better food than amar fast food which at parla
Specially spinach starter
Well located, ambiance is good, servers are well behaved.
Nice place for family dinner."
It was fun to celebrate my aunt's birthday at amar restaurant. The interior could have been a bit more attractive. It is quite a spacious place.
Best food in mumbai the rate is reasonable and the pav bhaji is the best item alomg with the normal pizza just loved the food out here and also the timing are flexiable its open till late night and home delivery is really fast on regular days
"Dont try the cheese khada pav bhaji the combination is not good!????.amar is known for its regular pav bhaji which is delicious You can have the pizza which comes with a thin crust,dint expect such a classy pizza at amar! You can also try the chatni pav there which my frn suggested Everything else was quite good and warm!"
