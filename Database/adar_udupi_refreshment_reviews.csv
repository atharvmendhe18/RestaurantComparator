Review
"Being a Delhi person, I am quite aware how Delhi food tastes but no one can beat the taste of South Indian food in Mumbai.. And this could be probably I have tasted South Indian here at first time... Very good food with proper hygiene"
All time favourite restaurant . Delicious veg food. Quick service. Very near to highway. Best and affordable veg food in vile parle. Thali and ice creams are awesome.
"Adar is a pretty average restaurant in vile parle which serves udupi food! The ambience of the place is very ordinary and oozes the old udupi styled rustic vibe! The food here is not bad but it doesn't warrant a praising too! It is okay if you keep in mind the prices , Cheap pricing! Due to the low prices the quality takes a significant hit!

Vile parle has many better udupi restaurant which serve much better food if compared to adar albeit they are slightly expensive! The upside of adar is its proximity to the highway , it is situated very near to the highway! If you are looking to grab a quick bite adar isn't a bad option! You can easily skip the place for a family dinner or meal!

"Adar is a pretty average udupi place located near the highway inlet of vile parle! The food , ambience and service are sub par and doesn't offer anything which warrants a planned visit here! It is awfully close to the highway which makes it easily accessible!

I happened to visit this outlet when i was travelling to pune , the outlet is very near to the highway which gave me the idea to have a quick bite before the journey!

I had ordered for idli which tasted okay but wasn't soft which really put me off , it didn't even seem fresh due to that! The silver lining of the cloud was the potato uthappa, i had never seen this dish anywhere else so gave it a try! The uthappa had boiled potatoes...read more"
"After reaching Mumbai airport searched for a good restaurant and some of the locals suggested this restaurant for breakfast. It's near to airport and can reach by walking.

Order was for Vada Paav, misal Paav and Mysore masal dosa and two tea.

The masal dosa was good with good amount of masala accompanied with sambar and coconut chutney.

All the items were good and was not that costly as well. Will definitely visit again if coming too Mumbai:)"
"This Punjabi Thali although didn't impress the punjabi in us, it definitely didn't disappoint either. A good value for money vegetarian option ✔

Have been coming to this place for decades.. since I was a kid. Has the traditional charm & warmth of any good Udupi restaurant. Can go anytime of the day.
"I've been visiting this place since almost 30 years. The decor is the same and thankfully the food Quality and the service.
Typical South Indian Udipi hospitality..
The Neer Dosa with Usal and Filter Coffee is one of the best I've had.
So the Rasam, Medu vada and Rawa dosa."
One of the oldest restaurants in parla.. definitely less popular as nothing great about food it's just ok. The place is stone's throw away from the western express highway.. typical south indian food and variety of punjabi dishes available.
"So ordered an uttappa and idli from here. Nothing to right home about. Just very very okay food. As there are places serving better variety & flavor in the area.

Suggestions for improvement:-
Then can up their game and have better food with more variety

Flavor - 5/10
Food - 5/10
Hygiene - 8/10
Quantity - 5/10
Quality - 6/10
Delivery time - 8/10"
I was regular here few months back why because it was close to office and my friend was vegetarian. It's a decent place nothing great about the food everything is ok. I mean if you work around the domestic airport area and are vegetarian then you can go there it's cheaper than shivsagar and you will see Milind Gunaji at lunch time if you are lucky.
"One of the oldest restaurants in vile parle east, once a favourite for south indian snacks but now slightly difficult to reach due to its proximity to the highway , domestic airport and road in front of it always full of heavy traffic. The food is basic south indian which is good in taste , also get punjabi dishes with lots of varieties in bread , chinese dishes are also on the menu but main consumption as seen is south indian dili, vada and dosas. Service is quick and prompt. Food is good but nothing special ,ambience is typical udipi but restaurant is favourite with a few groups who make it a point to come here everyday for their daily breakfast fix. Overall a nice , decent place."
"Hello guys this restaurant is too good for south Indian food and lovely place to go around with family I would rate this place as under
Staff 3/5
Ambience 3/5
Food 3.5 /5
Thank u adar restaurant"
We found this place after landing to Mumbai we were looking for a good breakfast and we decided to walk it up to this place from the airport. Settled for Batata Vada and Mysore Masala. Believe me when your outside South India and your still expecting Dosa to be like here it won't be. It was decent not anything like here. The flavour on the potato mash inside the Dosa is very very different.Tea Batata Vada was decent. Service was good and prompt.Pricing was diculously high 120 for a Dosa. Parking is on the road. Taste is okay to full your tummy.
Interesting mix of experience. At Arnd 9:30 in morning I happen to be at this place for the very first time. Expectations were similar to any other udipi. I ordered for a standard medu vada with sambhar on the side. To my surprise the medu vada seemed reheated in a microwave and wasn’t fresh. I checked they agree and took it back. Had the dosa which turned out fine. The service after being disappointed was upped to ensure I got my breakfast the way it shd be.
"I know this particular outlet as I used to work in this particular locality.. and in the need of urgency we as in my colleagues including me, We used to order from this particular restaurant.. it's a typical udipi restaurants serving majorly all the delicacies.. nice taste and pocket friendly.. if you are near this locality and want to grab simple veg lunch then it is recommended from my side"
"Best place to eat when you are domestic airport
Upma and south indian items are recommended
Value for money, Stable on taste .
One of old restaurant at the corner of Vile Parle"
"Small but always crowded.. Located just next WEH..
Great place for meals in budget..

Tried the lunch thali with puri.. Its quite filling.. decent taste..


Service is very fast.. you dont have to wait much.."
"Pocket friendly
Prompt and Fast service
Authentic to its core
Perfect for morning breakfast. We tried their South Indian dishes idly medu vada Rava sada dosa and coffee were all as per expectations and the taste was very authentic.
The best is this place starts as early as 8 in the morning and is not heavy on the pocket...!!!"
"Based on the fab reviews on zomato I took my siblings and nephew who were visiting from Canada to this restaurant but our excitement was short lived. Even the basic thing as Tea wasn't good. The food was disappointing to the core as we found hair, small stone & to much salt added. To cover it up they did offer us a discount which didn't matter but the experience was a SAD one."
"A typical udipi restaurant very near to the highway and domestic airport, I must have been here like 50 times to eat my lunch as my office was nearby. Nothing luxurious about the place, simple siting and no A/C to cool you as well. That being said, the restaurant serves good food although some might have issues with the hygiene. Carry your own bottle of water if possible, do try Punjabi food it's quiet good."
"It was more like a welcome treat for me when my driver took me to this place for breakfast as soon as I landed in Mumbai and enquired about a place that serves quick local flavour for breakfast. Initially I was a little apprehensive going by the name as I wanted to have local Mumbaiya stuff but it was quite a satisfying experience after I had Vada Pav and Misal Pav for breakfast.

The tea however was too sweet and milky and I didn't like it much and the thing that one needs to be careful about is the billing as they tend to charge you wrongly."
"Basis the reviews, had been to this place for a lite dinner, hd ordered punjabi thali. Chapatis were ok, pulao was nice but few of the sabjis were stale. Seems to be carryover item from lunch.
Little joint, reasonably priced, basic environment.
Will go back again to try south indian dishes."
"Tried out the Thali for dinner which was OK.
Seems to be like a typical udipi restaurant with the service quite prompt.
Not bad for another visit to try out south Indian snacks.

On a second visit tried an Aloo Maratha + Veg Biryani (155₹) ...got prompt service and certainly a good taste."
"Disappointed.. I ordered food .. N acc to online
menu bill was 265 rs. But wen d delivery came he asked for 300rs. I asked For the bill he said he will give a kaccha bill n rates have changed. Called the hotel he said rates have changed .. But they din't provide a authentic bill Zomato Reviewer plz update the new menu.."
"One of the oldest Udipis in the vicinity.
The quality and quantity is a hit with the locals.
If you're new in Vile Parle and you wish to know a local and cost effective joint, then this is your pick! Also, home delivers.

This review is based on the Punjabi and South Indian food, only."
"Must have - Rava dosa, filter coffee and mendu vada sambhar. Almost walkable distance from domestic airport.
This is the usual place for eating lite and serves the South Indian dishes the best. Filter coffee is pretty good.
Though it serves the North Indian sabzi items too but it's better if you eat dosas and vadas at this place."
"Whenever we go
To drop
Someone at the airport especially people flying early mornings this is our joint for an early breakfast.
They serve great sambar which is why I order the idli .
Their simple vegetable sandwich is good too .
A simple place not fancy ambience . But worth a try for its simplicity.
My dad adores the thali served here . Go for it if you have an appetite bet you won't regret."
"For those who stay in lodge close by domestic airport and if u r a South Indian, this is the place for your breakfast lunch and dinner. Reasonable pricing, pretty good quantity and good tasty good aswell. Though it's expensive in the hotels and lodging near airport, just a walk for 3min crossing a bridge would get u a sumptuous South Indian food."
"This place is something I cannot survive without since I have almost 5/7 breakfasts here.

Idlis, medu vadas, dosas including Mysore and rava and my favourite Upma, everything is good. The sambar is very consistent and rarely differs in taste. Top the breakfast with a hot filter coffee.

Chinese is good as well. I have never tried the Punjabi dishes here. As different seasons arrive, Adar will surely have the season's special on their menu.

Service and home deliveries are quick.

Good food and light on the pocket. Not exceptional quality but a good place for some quick snack or a heavy breakfast."
Have been visiting for long time. Very typical south Indian Mumbai food joint. Nice food and fast service. Just enough space. Try potato uttappa. Get idli fry. Location very convenient near domestic airport .
"All time South Indian breakfast light fast and fatafat good to have and healthy one.
Missing things for travellers is that you can't charge the phone or open your laptop.. Else it's a quick in and out breakfast center.
The food quality and taste has not changed since ages over here

Good Morning"
"Adar is a go to place for ur morning south Indian breakfast. They offer a wide variety of breakfast including idli, vada, upma, dosa & other breakfast items like misal pav, dahi vada etc. Punjabi dishes are good as well. Though I prefer having only south Indian here. The service is quick and the place is perfect for quick bites and cheap food."
"=====OUTLINE=====

Classical Udipi restaurant serving quality food. It's a place near Western Express Highway, so most of the working class people do halt at this place, munch and leave for their work. They serve South Indian food as their speciality, besides they also serve chinese, punjabi and fast food. They have home delivery facility as well. Cost for 2 is 300Rs( Breakfast).

=====AMBIANCE=====

Typical lunch home with class room style set up. The outlet has 2 sections, one outside the outlet & another one inside

I prefer South Indian food for my breakfast so just googled to find a place near by & Adar it was. Menu looked quite decent . I ordered for

">They got a crazy Daal Khichdi and Paneer Makhani 😘.
>Nice according to cost and service.
....Can try once 😏
Dont Have Pizza or Snacks
Dominos is 2 steps next to it 😋"
A simple south Indian restaurant serving good food to local public. The best part is it opens at 7 am. Have visited this early many times. Morning upma is the best served here. Paneer cheese masala is just great. mind you this is not a dosa dish its a punjabi sabzi and waters your mouth quickly
"A simple Udupi joint. Incase you are looking for razzmatazz this is not the place.

They serve south indian food which is the staple for anyone looking for a quick breakfast.

I have always tried the basics and it has worked. A place you can sit and have food which is nearest to the domestic airport and does not charge a bomb."
"This place is my mom- dads favourite place to hangout while back home from office as it is on the way home!
They usually have Pizza and tea or sometimes dosa as well!
I love chickoo milkshake they serve!"
"Have visited this place for breakfast on a few occasions. This hotel is very close to the domestic airport and always bustling with people during the morning hours. Typical ambience of a South Indian restaurant.
They have an elaborate menu with many South Indian dishes as well as local dishes for breakfast.
Have tasted their different dosas as well as coffee.
Their service is also super fast and within no time they serve the dishes.
Do visit if you need a quick bite."
"A pleasant place to be for breakfast, especially South Indian food. Nothing extraordinary about the service. Very humble and nice though.

Tip: Grab the tables on the outside."
"For the quality of food it offers at a price that does not harm your pocket much is amazing, highly recommend south Indian. A good place for an early Morning breakfast!"
"Adar is the typical utility Udipi restaurant that is dotted in various Mumbai neighborhoods. Located at a stone's throw from the airport intersection signal at Vile Parke east, this place caters to the regular local parcel orders for a breakfast at home or the hunger pangs takeaway that you would like at times.

Over breakfast I ordered Upma and it came out hot and fresh with a fresh and spicy chutney. I saw a lot of patrons ordering dosas and vadas as well and relishing it. They did also serve misal pav and potato vadas that were also coming out hot off the kitchen.

The tea here was one of the best that I have tasted in an udipi joint. Not too milky n not too strong , it had the...read more"
"Adar is your regular udupi restaurant banking on South Indian and North Indian food. Like all Udupi restaurants, its UPS is quick service and affordable no frills food. It’s quite a favourite with the nearby colleges especially for breakfast. I don’t remember how many times I might have gorged on the idli-vada-sambar here. Ambience is nothing great but service is quite quick."
"had  ordered dosa from there,sambhar was tasting like water which had diluted sugar and when i opened the parcel all the chutney came out of it .Dosa was as crispy as khakra .The dosa was shattered into pieces.They should give the chutney in a small plastic pouch .when i opened the parcel, dosa was united with chutney."
"Been here few weeks back for some snacks after walk and must say really nice, affordable and tasty food corner. Good for masala dosa and thali."
"My one and only happy fooding in Mumbai, for breakfast, lunch and dinner too. It is all about tasty and reasonable food for all (red veggies).Adar is essentially a multi-cuisine, or so it says, but masters in South Indian and Maharashtrian food. Starting from the idli and vada sambar, to mysore masala dosa and paav bhaaji, everything is very tasty. The prices are fairly on the lower side and you can eat your heart out.

"Another of those saviours, when you are running late to work, have no time to eat or carry breakfast , and the stomach is on a different, stubborn trip altogether.! You appease it with a cup of coffee, and it wont listen. You treat it to a fruit, and YET, it wont listen!
