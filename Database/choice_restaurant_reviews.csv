"I have ordered chicken schezwan fried rice,but i have got just egg rice. I have wasted my money."

In chicken chilli I think the chef forgot to add chilli. It was purely bland. Biryani masala was too much sour.

I ordered butter roti but received simple roti
Had ordered burnt garlic fried rice. Garlic was raw. Not so good

egg masala was sweet taste very bad
They should rename this dish to Tandoori rubber. The meat was extremely chewy and strong. You‚Äôll get a headache from chewing all that chicken.
Blant and tasteless

"Love the authentic taste of food; the price is absolutely worth the quantity and quality of food. Chinese or Mughlai, it's a super hit."

This my absolute favourite restaurant. The ambience is welcoming and charming. The Mughlai dishes are so yummy and delicious. It gives perfect lip smacking and fingerlicking taste. Also the presentation is so good with full of cream. Food is very hygienic and in one's budget. The quality is unmatched. It was a great experience to be there and I'd love to go there again and again. One must have tried the mughlai cuisine here atleast once in a lifetime.
"We ordered mughlai food in Choice. It was so delicious with smokey flavour. The mouthwatering dishes gives a perfect smack of mughlai cuisine. They provide high quality foods with wide range of varieties. Also,the packaging and delivery is on point. I think it's the best restaurant in Andheri (e) with dishes in budget. I would say one must try mughlai dishes here atleast once."
Good quantity as well as good quality. They have variety of tikkas with delicious taste. Also good packaging and fast food delivery.

I had ordered a chicken tikka biryani it seemed frozen and was just heated in a oven and deliverd. The gravy tasted tangy. The chicken pieces were not at all good. There was too much oil in it. The gravy was too much compared to the rice. I didn't like it.
The biryanis and seekh kebabs are quite nice of thisrestaurant and great decor.the food quality of this place are good.They should maintain hygiene.
"It is located in Marol. The ambience of the place was good. The staff was very polite. It's famous for its north Indian and mughlai dishes.
