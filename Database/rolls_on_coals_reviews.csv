I found hair in the food.

spaghetti could have been less thick and bulky
""
1 of the best ever had. just a suggestion to replace baby corn with something else like pickled cucumber or carrots.

"Recently I had been to Rolls on Coals and i just loved the place, the ambience was so good and of course all the items served were awesome. Their staff was also good. One of their staff by the name of Lionel was very helpful in guiding us in choosing the food and so we were very happy and surely will keep visiting this place again and again and i would advise everyone to visit this place."
"The ambiance is superb, I highly recommend this restaurant, the food was amazing and the service was fantastic."

"Our experience at Rolls on Coals was just lovely! The interiors are very lively and vibrant. They have good music playing and the services are very quick. We tried their :
Pink Panther Sandwich - 9/10
Cheesy Volcano Sandwich - 10/10
Special BBQ Roll - 9/10
Watermelon Cooler - 8.5/ 10
The Peach Iced Tea - 9/10
Everything was very delicious and filling. Their portion size is amazing, it's a great place to chill and have some amazing food with family and friends. They also offer a private deck area for various events which is on the first floor. A must visit place!"

Almost no veggies in the pasta.. you'd have to take all the add-ons to make a proper pasta..

Pathetic food taste. Seems like good colour was added in pasta
