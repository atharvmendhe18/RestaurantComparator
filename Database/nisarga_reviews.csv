"order was not delivered at all... however it showed delivered. very strange! Thankfully I saw it on time n reported after which it was re arranged. please check with delivery guy, why did he mark it as ""delivered?? A tip was also added for him. Disappointed."
The food had fallen on the road & was not accepted
Chicken boti was too spicy
It didn‚Äôt taste anything like chicken ghee roast. It was more like fried Chinese chicken. Didn‚Äôt expect this.

it is a very poor version of Chicken ghee roast. They have poor knowledge of coastal karnataka delicacy even though they belong to that area. Made it like dry chicken chilly.
"Very disappointing food. Green colour hydrabadi biryani, I have never seen. It was absolutely tasteless and was not fresh. Chicken tikka was undercooked. Not recommended for next time."

"Very good place ! Great food ! Been a fan of the food since my childhood and now my brother from Aurangabad , Harmehr Oberoi suggested this item called ‚ÄúKerala Fried Chicken‚Äù and it was just amazing ! I love Nisarga and I love my brother"
""
there was no salt in the biriyani.
"ordered paneer tikka received Chicken gravy
this is totally wrong ..."
Considering this restaurant is a south Indian specialty restaurant kori rotti was tasteless and prawns hawa fry portion size has reduced 50 percent for 700 rupees u give only 8 prawns
Too spicy
The item containers were not secured with cellotape... and the content spilled while delivery. The restaurant did not exchange or return anything
The freshest fish you can find. Taste authentic as always. Superb
"Horrible service! Being a hotelier myself, I understand that quick service is something that everyone is looking for but here each dish takes atleast 40 to 45 mins to reach your table. I ordered for prawns for which i waited for a good half n hr and then when I asked where the order is, the waiter mention that prawns is not available. Does it really need 30 mins to confirm if they have prawn‚Äôs available?!
Later i also ordered a bowl of ice cream (its just supposed to be scooped out to a bowl) which took another 30 mins! I would not complain about the food quality since it was okish, however would not recommend this place. There are many other good places with similar menu, better food...read more"
