No salt in noodles
"gravy is watery, not at all thick and no taste"
Namak bahut jayda hai rice me and soup bhi kam hai
"Too much gravy given with Triple rice. It was watery and the Manchurian balls were tasteless.

The rice quality was good and it had enough salt and veggies.

Overall it was decent."
Quantity was good
"spilled package
no taste in mushrooms dry all the gravy spilled"

"paneer crispy didn't seem like paneer crispy .. it has noodles and some piece of paneer which very bad in taste and it was not wirth eating and a total waste.

soup was very good taste and quality wise
sping roll is ok ok
spring roll also has noodles inside it which is quite unnecessary"
The gravy is watered down to water and the rice looks and tastes funny. It carries a lighter shade of red

spring roll was kachaa maida & no taste in spring roll

"food quality is good, just avoid packing hot Chinese food in polythene plastic bags and rather use boxes"
