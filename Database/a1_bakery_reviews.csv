"A1 bakery is one of the oldest and most famous bakeries in Bandra. The best thing about this bakery is quality of delicious food items at a very inexpensive price.
We loved A1 Bakery for its delicious Chicken Makhani Roll, Mutton Puff, Chicken Lollipop, Spring Rolls, Croquettes and Mawa Cake."

"Such a revolting taste of all the 3 items I had.
Instead of chicken they have put some mashed potatoes with maida stuffing...if you want to have a good puffs
I highly recommend roshan bakery which is in dongri...amazing stuff"
"The food was ok
I mean not that great
Average
It was crowded and I thought wah nice food may be
But no !
We got ourself some chicken pan roll which was good to see but average in taste
Cheese balls were ok it was eatable with the sauce"
"Burger- worst taste and found ant in that and it wasn‚Äôt fresh.
Chicken croissant- was not fresh .

Things to note:

3. More of Snacks options available

Food we tried:

1. Chicken seekh roll: (the one wrapped in the picture)
Taste: 5/5( it's the best roll, must try)

2. Chicken Pan roll: it's crunchy outside and roll is filled with chicken fillings.
Taste: 3.5/5 ( it's okayish not so bad)

3. Mutton puff:
Taste: 4.5/5 ( it's damn good, still my preference is more towards chicken)

4. Apple pie:
Taste: 2/5 ( quite soggy, didn't taste good)


Yeah, that's it I'll recommend to try burger also.
I'll update soon whenever I get time to explore their other munchies in the menu.

Thank you."

Since the pandemic, whenever I passed by this bakery I‚Äôve seen a long waiting line and I thought to myself the food must be really good! So I went by & bought myself veg patties, Chicken puff, Chicken lollipop, Chicken Pan roll and Chicken Croquette.
I must say the prices are quite economical. The only snack that I liked was the Chicken Pan roll, which had fine pieces of chicken and spices in every bite. The rest of the food was standard.
So on the final note- I wouldn‚Äôt wait in a long line to get the foodstuff from here though people have their own particular tastes."

"If you wanna go try chicken quiche it's not available everyday maybe in the weekends only but only early in the morning.
Chicken croissant are all time favorite.
Just no seating area so don't expect any privacy but if you're bakery lover you should definitely visit"

My favourite is the mutton puff. Simple. Flaky. Good. But anything you buy here will be tasty. Thank You. I always come back"
"A1 Bakery located at Hill Road has varied of baked items. Its a small take away spot serving Puffs, Rolls, Burgers, Patty, etc. The rates are very much affordable and fine according to the quality given.
The taste is really great here."

"It is a great place for a quick snack. They provide their own baked breads too. Veg and non veg both are available. I love their chicken lollipops, which is affordable and tasty."
"A Small Bakery yet always crowded with people located in Hill Road. They serve some real good rolls, pattice, Steaks, etc.

I tried their Chicken Manchurian Roll and Chicken Sticks. The roll was a bun with stuffings of chicken manchurian in the middle. The taste of chicken manchurian was more like a chicken pepper but the taste was excellent. Priced at ‚Çπ45 it was a steal. Chicken Sticks were good too but bit oily but nevertheless when the taste is good then sometimes we could ignore the oil.

I don't know about other stuffs from there but whatever I tried I completely loved it.

P.S: Unfortunately could not click pictures on this occasion as it was a takeaway and as soon as we entered...read more"
"Mouth watering snacks served here
The burgers and rolls are a must try.
My all time favourite is the ""chicken tikka roll"" which never fails to disappoint :)"
An amazing place to get food to carry home. Yummy and tasty quick food. Must visit if someone is travelling towards Bandra. Inexpensive and in budget tasty food. Its a really old shop but yet one of the best shops to eat from. Old is definitely gold.
"So we were at bandra bandstand spending really good time and enjoying the heavy rains , and at the same time we came across this facebook post about this place we decided to visit this place
What we ordered - 1) chicken lollypop
2) potato cheese ball
3) veg roll
4) manchurian puff sort of thing
5) mawa puff sort of a thing
This all was extremely inexpensive but good in taste , its good for those days when you dont have a lot money in your pocket and you are near or in bandra and you need to hop on to some snacks."
"A1 Bakery is an iconic and one of the oldest heritage bakeries in Bandra West. It is located on Hill Road opposite Hearsch Bakery. A really great place for a quick snack and for those on a tight budget. Their prices are reasonable and value for money. This bakery is a favourite for college students and youth.

They are well known for their chicken makhani roll, chicken burgers, chicken cutlets, mutton patties, chicken lollipops etc.

Their products are fresh and tasty and most of their items are sold out by early evening.

Tried their chicken makhani roll, chicken puffs and mutton pattice which were truly lip smacking and delicious.

A must visit."

Nothing as good as a1 bakery after a rough night out on town .. lovely and filling baked products in the wee hours of the morning .. do try their quiches and lollipops
"Located opp Holy family hospital ,A1 bakery know for it cinnamon rolls ,Mutton pattices ,Bread rolls ,Mutton roll ,chicken chops ,Chicken burger etc....not forgetting Poi( Goan bread)......Value for Money ......Great service ....Must try Chicken loaded Burger ......Array of snacks displayed ....."
"These guys are like Hearsch but with far superior savouries. Their puffs mutton and otherwise are something to me seem top notch.

Even though the taste and quality of the food here has somewhat changed, not fallen, it still tastes better than what is served by a vast majority of bakeries around
The food is fresh since there is constant outflow.

Except for the croissants and some of the biscuits, I am more or less a sucker for everything they have to offer. At the same time, very pocket friendly too

"Best for quick bites
a1 bakery has been there for ages and must visit for those wanting to have quick bites.
must try is their famous mutton patty .
Try their Pavs and Brun breads also.
Place is hygienic and have good options for both veg and non veg ones. Mawa cakes are also good.
Very Economical and meal for 2 will cost under 200rs maximum."
"Nice place to have a quick bite at reasonable price. Taste of food is good to ok but it's a total worth as they start serving at 6am in morning. One should definitely try this place once.
This is one of the very old bakeries in Mumbai.
They have ample variety of dishes/options.

Go for chicken masala patties, mutton puff, cheese ball, chicken pan roll, chicken spring roll, veg. Patties, chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet and chicken nugget stick. This is preference order for me. You start with anyone of these and soon you ll try all of them.

Nice environment and full of crowd even at early morning.
Recommended place to go. Hit like if you find my review helpful."
"A really good place if you want a quick snack and you're on a tight budget. The Chicken Pan roll and Mutton Pattice are really good. The Chicken croissant is also one of their best sellers. Must try their Danish bun. They also serve fresh bread, buns and rolls.

The staff is friendly."
"This is such a great place for snack and savories! Prices were reasonable though they have increased recently. Variety of puffs, rolls, sponge cakes etc
Cinnamon rolls, hotdog rolls are good.

"Have had food a couple of times from here.We always brought stuff in the evening when the fresh batch would arrive and the food would be piping hot.... Yesterday we purchased in the afternoon and the food was cold.... This was a real acid test....We opted for the chicken pan roll, chicken croissant and chicken puff...The pan roll stuffing had an overdose of onions. Even the other two items lacked taste.... This is an iconic place and this was not expected...."
Best place where I'm eating since my childhood school bunking till my college farewell and now office friends it is still now AWESOMEüòòüòçü§©

"if you are looking for quality of bakery at pocket friendly price then this is one of the best option  to visit in bandra. 
Had Chicken Pan Roll which was amazing."
"One of the best pocket friendly places for a quick no fuss time. It's one of the oldest bakeries in Bandra. I've been going here since my childhood days and never thought of reviewing this iconic place until now. Its bang opposite Hearsch Bakery on Hill Road. Both are very famous. Easy to miss this place if you're looking for the first time. Ideal place for morning birds, who would love have breakfast after their morning walk. It opens up around 5:45am!!
There's no seating, just 2 tables to stand and eat. Their prices have increased and portions have reduced over time and a slight change in taste as well but still not bad for a quick bite.
Would recommend their Chicken Pan Roll, Chicken...read more"
Everything about this bakery is just perfect. I could eat here everyday and never get tired of it. this place is absolutely pocket friendly. If you are in Bandra then this place is a must!
"Do I need to describe anything about this bakery?

Well we all are familiar with it, Would you like to start your day with some great breakfast? This is where you should be. One of the oldest bakery in Bandra, great for a quick bite and early morning breakfast.

Their puffs, rolls and daily bakery products are good in taste and easy on pocket. I had tried most of their menu, I liked their chicken nuggets, chicken mayo roll, Chicken Masala Puff, chicken kabab Patty, chicken lollipop and veg puff.

Apart from that their snacks bakery products are good too! Their Butter Rusk (khaari) is amazing."
My all time favourite place ......nice place for yummy snacks...........mutton puff.....pan fried chk roll......chk burger........mutton kebab. .....must try delicious mawa cake
"One of the best place to have quick bites in bandra, they have variety of things to try like paneer roll ,chicken pan roll ,lollipops etc. Loved every dishes of here no complains.

Very pocket friendly. Highly recommended give a try to this place."
If your in bandra and what something budget friendly to munch on then this is one of the places to go to. They have a wide variety of sweet and savoury. I for one love their chicken croquette. It one of their best sellers too. Another must have is their chicken pan fried roll. If you are into the sweet mayonnaise then do have the chicken mayo roll.
"If you are in Bandra, then this a bakery just opposite Hearsch Bakery on Hill Road. Many customers throng this place. Both Hearsch and A1 bakeries are very popular. We tried out their Spring Roll, Mutton Roll, Chicken Pan Roll, Veg Puff
and not to forget Mawa cake. All this we had parcelled and took home as there was hardly place to stand and eat there with people jostling for space near the counter. We savored on these snacks while watching IPL match at home."
"So been here just yesterday and I picked up 5 things with a friend of mine so that we could sit on rocks at Bandstand and enjoy our little meal. To our surprise things we got was really good! Veg cutlet is my favourite, very yummy and delicious. Next fav was cheese balls, soft and you taste cheese in every bite. Danish was soft and it was pure delight. Mava cake was cherry on top and very soft!! Also tried coconut flavour sweet which was filling. And we were done with dinner. It was fair enough for both of us and the rates were cheap, quality was nice! I would love to pick things from here for munchings, it‚Äôs totally worth it. read more"
"Fantastic Place you could find as early as 6 am... talk about their puffs..rolls.. patties...spring rolls...Veg or non veg.. definitely a go to place to stand out and eat or take away...

"After your early morning photo walk or a run on the streets in Bandra, this place is a perfect delight. Their Chicken puff, Chicken Nugget Stick and Chicken spring rolls are some of the must haves these people serve."
"There are 2 famous bakeries on Hill Road, Bandra (W). One is THE Hearsch Bakery and the other is located just opposite it, A1 Bakery! Both have huge number of daily customers. My first choice will be always Hearsch Bakery because of the variety of food (also cakes/sweets!) it offers. Visit these 2 bakeries at evening time, and you will have to wait in queue for your turn. Both start their stalls in early morning time.

I had MAWA CAKE, PANEER ROLL, CHICKEN PAN ROLL and CHEESE BALL from here. They were all delicious, but CHICKEN PAN ROLL and CHEESE BALLS were fabulous! üòç

Sometimes what seems and first impressions can be deceiving. Small backery almost unnoticeable if u where'nt actually looking for it. The pull of this place is the mini but delicious and savoury spread of quick bikets. Tried all their nv offerings which not only look good but fills ur heart with content too. Never miss a chance to hog on some Everytime I'm at Hill road or Bandstand...one of my every green favs for sure.
"Located on Hill Road just opposite Hearsch Bakery, this has been our favourite go to place for so many years. A1 Bakery offers tasty and and fresh snacks at reasonable prices.

Have tried their Chicken croquettes, chicken puffs, Chicken lollipops, cheese balls and mava cakes and would definitely recommend trying these snacks.
A fantastic place to pick up some great snacks."
"Located bang opposite to hearsch bakery this place serves food items like hearsch bakery. As we forgot and went to eat burgers on tuesday we realize it remains closed on tuesdays so we thought of trying burgers from A1.
Same paking and rates but taste is not alike. Burger tasted like it had only mayo in the bun and the tikki was also smelling. The only thing which was good were the waffers."
"What a gem of a place!!!

The best part is it opens around 6AM and is a perfect joint to have some yum breakfast. Chicken croquettes, mutton puff, Chicken Spring roll, chicken kebab....my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.

Definitely a goto place, and apparently its quite famous in Bombay."
The best bakery in Mumbai without a doubt. This place opens at 5:45 am. We make it a point to visit this place before our bike trip. The Mutton patice is awesome. The chicken pan roll is really nice. The cakes & pie's are nice as well.
I go to A1 bakery almost 5 times a week for my mutton puff and chicken mayo roll fix. A1 is one of the most iconic bakery¬∑s of mumbai i would say. Thier mutton puff is the best in mumbai at the price point of 18rs per piece. Chicken lolipops can be given a miss. Chicken mayo roll is loaded with mustard spice mayo. I like the chicken croquettes as well. Surprisingly even the veg puff here is nice and tasty. Not a lot of places in mumbai make a good veg puff but A1 nails it.
"Everything from here is absolutely reasonable and very tasty
My favourite place to go to when I'm damn hungry and need some quick bites
The chicken puff from here is my favourite! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
This is where my bread has come from for the last 25 years. My mother has been buying things from here for the last 50 years. Even is a historical landmark in Bandra. The food over the years has definitely changed the portion sizes have reduced but the price comparatively is still much lower. One thing about a one is they never skim on quality. I do miss the mutton Pan rolls but I do appreciate the new chicken nuggets. Overall a fantastic place to get your baked goods from.
"Over all good for quick bites the best part about the place is that it opens at 5:45 am so it sounds for an over timer to come here and enjoy a filthy breakfast
Pro tip - ask them to heat the items in microwave"
"Good tasty puffs
Chicken rolls are really spicy
Cookies, khari, etc are really of good quality
Rolls are little more oily. Please serve better ketchup along with puffs."
"Have been eating here since my childhood, but never thought of reviewing this place until now. So starting with my most favorite, the burger. For me a this place has the most amazing burger. If I had to choose between top burgers and this obviously this will be the one. It's so freaking delicious. Apart from the burger you may also try their chicken puff, chicken cutlet and chicken roll. You have many too choose from. All in all it will be worth your money."
"This place is a great bakery
Good place for a bread fix
They have a great variety
I love the quality of the bread
Come here for a quick snack fix
Value for money"
The only good thing about this place is their fresh bread and the fact that it opens very early in the morning around 5.30 am. Even at that time they are packed. The food there is ok at best and nothing to brag about. Their chicken and mutton puffs are decent.
"A1 bakery a very old bakery in bandra. All bandra people are aware about this small eatery on the main road can be easily located.

But unfortunately, the quality has gone down.

Try the chicken puff or chicken croissant the taste has clearly changed.

Would not reccomended to try this. Rather cross the road and try Hearsch Bakery. Try only when too hungry and no option is availa

Will definately try again to see whether its still the same or not."
"Recommended:
To come here on an early Sunday morning at 6am and truly enjoy some snacks üëåüèª that's how the peeps in Bandra do it !!!

Chicken Mayo Roll
Veg Roll
Chicken Spring Roll
Chicken Pan Roll
Mutton Roll
Chicken Quiche
Chicken Cutlet with Pav"

"A1 bakery is your small bakery right on Pali Hill road- which serves some really good non vegetarian snacks at very cheap prices. It‚Äôs a non-vegetarian paradise as they serve chicken croquettes, quiche, chicken lollipops, chicken spring rolls and what not- all priced between rs 30-70. However they don‚Äôt have any seating space so you are either supposed to eat standing there or pack it home. But beware as their items get over right in the morning and quiet literally here the early bird catches the worm works.

Apart from the non-vegetarian savouries, they also serve some really good freshly baked bread which also gets over pretty quick.
