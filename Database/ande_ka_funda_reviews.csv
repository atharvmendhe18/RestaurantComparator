Egg lapeta is a must try dish. With masala pav."
"The place is quite a compact one, with decent service. In contrary to this the food is amazing! I tried the egg masala papad since I wanted to see how will they put egg in a papad it did sound weird to me but as it arrived it looked so good! The egg was very nicely grated with loads of cheese with a balanced taste of onions, tomatoes and chat masala, topped with coriander. Next one the list was masala boiled (forgot to take picture because couldn‚Äôt resist myself from eating as soon as it arrived? The egg was cut in pieces and fried to perfection with other spices. Last was the sizzling light house just as the name it was delicious as well! Wrapped in an omlet it was filled with a bhaji...read more"
One of my favourite egg adda around. When i 1st visited here i didnt knw there were actually so many varieties made from egg. The quantity is good enough for 2 people. Egg gotala is the best served here.
"If you love Eggs you should visit this place for sure. Variety of delicasies with combination of egg, tomato, onion & loads of cheese.
Recomended dishes:
1) Lighthouse - omlet tooped with half fry, tomato onion gravy and ofcourse , Cheese.
2) Italian cheese - half fry topped with italian gravy and cheese"
"It's my first visit to Ande ka funda .. And that time i know about it there is lot of variety of egg dishes.
I tried here egg lapeta , ghotala , light house.
But my fav is egg ghotala ... Its really tasty dish..
New comer must try this dish .. And it's special dish frm ande ka funda."
"Good food, nice packaging, delivered within time. Best place for fast food. Worth ordering. Should visit the place atleast once. And also getting food home delivered through zomato."
Was too hungry and was craving for some Aanda Bhurji so what better place to buy it from Aande ka Funda! The quantity of bhurji is awesome. He also called before delivery to ask how many pav we want. So good customer service too. Comes with salad. Do try the Aanda Bhurjee. Good stuff
"One of the best place to explore variety of egg dishes
I always used to visit this place to have my favorite dish called egg ghotala but during my 4th or 5th visit the taste differed compared to my previous experience. I hope they will get back to the quality which they served earlier. We also tried their dish called sizzling light house which was tasty as well."
The best egg dishes at amazing prices. The ambience is a bit untidy but must visit if you love eggs. The food is delicious and full of flavour. I am absolutely looking forward to visiting this place again for some mouth watering dishes. 10/10 experience just because of the food. Must order the triple X
"The place is bit untidy, but the food is yummy.
They have a lot on the menu, one gets confused as to what to try and not.
Overall Experience

Ambience 1.5/5
Food 4/5
Service 4/5"
"Eggetarian paradise...
No match to the unique egg recipies, and the taste is just amazing. A must visit for all those who don't want to miss on egg magic."
"One of my favourite egg places around!
All the egg lovers should not miss out on this outlet.
Excellent variety of mouth watering egg dishes.

Must try: Ghotala, Anda pav with gravy & Triple XXX

Good & quick service.
The only thing I wanted here is that they should be open in the afternoon as well.

SERVICE: 3/5
FOOD: 4.5/5
AMBIENCE: 3/5"
super
Good
Since the monsoons have started anda toh banta hai..the variety out here is really good and it‚Äôs one my favourite places to njoi and indulge into eggs. The service is promt and good. They ensure you leave with a hearty and satisfied meal.
"You will get the best variety of egg dishes here...i had egg after almost ages...so i just enjoyed each and every bite of their dish
I had 2 dishes
1)sizzling lighthouse
2)triple xxx ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fully satisfied with the taste,quantity üëê"
"Had Egg Ghotala and Egg Masala Pav. If you are fed up with the regular version of Egg preparation you must try out the dishes served here. Rating it a 3 as I expected the place to be a bit tidier. It is definitely a go for take-away.

Quality 3.0
Quantity 3.5
Value for money 3.5"
Charged extra without informing. More than the bill amount
The egg rice was spicy. It could have been better in taste.
Way too salty
awesome food
"Horrible place. 1st of all they took so so long to bring the food, that i actually called and asked them ""kab aaega? Ruku ya jau?"" And tasteless food. That egg ghotala looked like some mashed gravy and tasted like air (no taste). Only good thing? They have Paytm"
"For all the eggeterians and egg lovers out there, you definately should visit this place.
They have a lot of variety dishes made from egg.
Also, the range of omlets here is wide.
The place is quite small though but the taste of the dishes makes your visit a worth. And a take away is always an option."
Very fast service. Amazing food. Never thought egg could be made in so much variety. Clean place. Awesome and very friendly staff. Cold drinks available too.
"Ande ka funda is a regular joint serving variations of eggs and there is nothing much to write home about.

The place lacks hygiene and the food served is not of a very high quality. Tried Cheese omlette, cheese ghotala and Triple XXX which were all OK.

The place doesn't have recall value."
"Rating the place purely on its offering. If one is looking for hygiene or ambience or service then they better avoid it.

It offers varieties of egg dishes at very reasonable price. Majority of the offerings tastes good.

Sizzling Light House is a must try. Enough for 2 people. Triple XXX and Ande Ka Funda Special are also good but Sizzling Light House has to be their star offering."
If u missed out on your proteins this is the place u should be visiting. A ture eggitarians paradise desi street style. They are very generous when it comes to butter and oil while cooking the masalas so dont think i it would please the health conscious but u can certainly visit on one of you cheat days.
"For all the egg lovers in Kandivali ande Ka funda is an ideal place . The staff and owner seems to be very friendly and the prices are reasonable. The food taste nice here and they have quite options in food when comes to egg
Must have their XXX dish
Bhurji was also nice

The place is small and around 15 to 20 ppl can be accommodated at a time"
"Ande ka Funda!!!
The name say it all that it's an egg place but not for egg lover. The place is to small food is below average. Place is to small, one time we can go that's it..."
Nice place for egg lovers so many variety of different types of dishes actually total confused what to eat & what to not .....after all very good food taste but very small place .....
"If u r a eggiterian thn u shud b definitely eating variety of dishes at this place....they have some delicious and mouth watering dishes like light house...xxx....boiled anda masala....double decker....surati ghotala...u cn try as many dishes as you cn your stomach will b full bt ur heart will not
...too much variety of dishes in egg...even have veg Chinese which average.....place is little small very few sittings...."
Horrible absolutely pathetic. Do not go here its no good taste. It will taste good only to the people who have not tried eggs at mahesh egg centre opposite eskay resorts. Its worst at ande ka funda. Do not go here pls.
Tried the triple x and classic anda bhurji with pav. Both were super spicy but yummy stuff. Good place for egg lovers. Ambience is pretty decent.
Irresistible yummmmmmmmmmm is the word paradise for egg lovers Egg Zan Zani & sizzling a must have here have dropped in multiple times & try experimenting new dishes ;)
"To whom so ever ever who runs this place ,If you can't deliver the stuff then ,please don't mark yourself as eligible to take online orders.What it does is,that you will lose a customer even before he has become one.

@Zomato-:Please reverify if the vendor accepts online order,Pathetic experience with this hotel even without tasting the food.,Can we have negative ratings please."
"Love the food. Been there multiple times!

I am Hard core Egg Lover tried it's competitors like Andawala & Mr. Egg. It's cost effective and tastier compared to Andawala. But not best hygiene or ambience. Needs to work on it asap!!

Please work on the restaurant's ambience and hygiene!

But never disappointed wid taste or service.

Must try: Sizzling Light House & Egg Dhosa

Please update contact number on Zomato!!!!"
"We try sizzling light house that is popular dish at that place there are limited variety of eggs available but special dish taste is much better
Omelette and bhurji taste is not so much good"
"Nice place to visit for egg lovers! Located in the by lanes near Mahavir Nagar, being a gujrati locality most people do not make eggs at home and end up eating outside, this place is a blessing for them!
It is a roadside made up in a shop with outside sitting. Hygiene concerned should stay away!
Apart from basic boiled egg, omlete and bhurji options they have variety in the menu like Egg Zan Zani [for those who like spicy food], Egg Ghotala, Poplet and Egg Achari. Of late they have also started Chinese dishes which are also nice. 
A must visit place for those who love eggs!"
A very small place opened in a shop with plastic tables and chairs in the open .. Excellent egg dishes served! And you will wonder so much you can do with an egg by looking at the menu. Triple XXX is the best dry dish. It has 3 layers of omlette ..burjii.. and an half fry on the top.. it is topped with cheese! 10/10 on Yummm meter !! Sizzling Egg is yet another best dish. We finished the meal with ande ka funda special egg item which had gravy .. Egg Jhan Jhanit and anda ghotalaa are the other dishes I would recommend here. All are best to be eaten with a pav.. You can tell them to recommend some heavy or light dish as you want. Heaviest dish has 8 eggs in it. So really HEAVYYY! Not...read more
"The name itself say a lot of things about the place. This place is just awesome for the people who have craving for eggs. This place has 36 variety of egg dish. So let me tell you about the place, it is located in satya Nagar in borivali West. The place is small it has two sections either you can seat inside or prefer to sit outside. But my advice to all you people is that you take a seat outside. Because in between those section to the right corner they have this open kitchen. So if you sit inside, the spices may go in your eyes. From the various variety, what I tried was the Triple X. Now you must be wondering how it is prepared and what ingredients are put to make this wonderful dish....read more"
"A great place for anda stuff... be prepared to gain tons of calories but all his dishes r mouthwatering.. Do try gotala..

PS: If you are sarabhai typez then this place is not made for you.."
"Taste is what drives you to come and literally HOG over here.The place is not that ""awww, the ambiance is mind boggling"" but if you are an egg lover & don't mind eating street food. That's your target.
#FoodMagnet #MumbaiMagnet"
"Situated between a shop and another egg place..one has to be careful while looking fr ir!
The food iz nice! Cheese Italian iz the best!!
We tried the gotala also but cheese Italian waz better!!‚úå"
"Though some varities available with lucrative names taste is not what you get.

If you are bored with normal omlete, bhurji and half fry, try some new dishes with Indian masala here."
"Being an Eggitarian, what more you could ask for!
Varieties of egg dishes with cheese.. mayo..
Awesome food in really cheap price!!
Apna naya anda ka addaa üòâ"
"You get some tasty egg dishes here for a cheap price! Eggetarians can have a real treat here, but it's just located at a wrong place, it's in a very remote area!"
"Nice lil place to go with your Eggie friends. Different variety of egg dishes along with other veg dishes. But its main specialty is of egg, so must try ."
"I have been seeing this place on my visits to Dmart. And on 31st evening we four cousins decided to give it a try.

Place has stiff competition from next door Andewalla but Ande ka Funda beats it.

We went for light house , XXX and Italian omelette accompanied by Pav. To our surprise all were tasty and something new for us.

I have been regular egg eaters but never had anything ike this before. They also serve veg Chinese and we had veg crispy and sechwen fried rice both well done.

Ambience is simple, neat and clean. Service staff is friendly and we'll versed with menu.

I would recommend this place to every eggatrian in vicinity"
"Egg lovers paradise. It's a small joint at a not so busy location. We tried the sizzling light house and it was just soo delicious! Will be back for more and surely more frequent.
Would have rated 5 if it was a bit more clean."
This is an egg eaters paradise. They have setup the place in a small shop but they serve delicious food. Their bhurji and triple xxx is amazing. Even the boiled egg pav is worth trying. I would recommend anyone to visit on a weekday since it's less crowded and you can enjoy the food. On a weekend it's packed and takes too long to get a table. Rest I can bet once you eat the food you would be definitely visiting it again.
"On sunday night. I had gone with my friends.
Strictly for egg lovers.
Recently they have started veg fried rice too.

Key highlights:
The place is new.
Management is new. People working there dint had any work experience.
No proper bill.
Bt we can see a nice potential in them. This place would become famous once the management nd everyone is settled there.

One customer was shouting that how much time it will take for the order to reach our table.

Another customer was yelling that 'khana kitna thanda hai'.

Ambience: A regular place to eat. No such ambience.

Service: Decent service to us. Bt got negative feedback from fellow customers around us.

Food: Good food.

"When the dilemma of choosing a place to eat and laziness join hands, we tend to end up sitting in the first nearby food place that comes to mind. KFC, McDonald's and Subway actually benefit on a huge scale owing to this very attitude of us urban humans. Amid one such evening, Ande Ka Funda suddenly popped up in my mind and, having passed it by quite a few times earlier and wanting to go there, we made our way through suffocating traffic to this place.

The place has a quirky, Bollywood-ish name and yet seems apt for what it intends to be. Ande Ka Funda is a casual eat-out place focusing on, as the name suggests, egg varieties. Situated predominantly in and around a Gujarati-centric...read more"
A very small joint...but food is excellent...at least to my taste...serves different types of egg dishes...good place to enjoy some simple fast food (egg based) with friends...
"Place is small but you won't get disappointed with quality and quantity they serve. Those who love to eat egg items, a must try place. They have good varieties and it's good to visit when you're low on budget!"
"A rare and brilliant egg joint in borivali!
You should try the TRIPLE X, ANDE KA FUNDA SPECIAL, CHEESE ITALIAN ,BOILED TIKKA . Good varieties are available!
You won't leave the place without liking the food!
Must visit once.....You will tend to visit more after that!
Service and ambience is out of question!"
"Its a very small un noticed egg joint om the outskirts of mahavir nagar. The place came to limelight since it serves seasonaly the desi(yellow) eggs.

The place is realy small with plastic tables which will be arranged as per ur convi, and mostly near the stove where he cooks which often makes u feel the heat.

The food! They have some real cool combinations and fusions. U cannot expect the dish called italian to have only italian spices. Its comes with more of indian spices and some italian seasoning. We had ordered italian ,triple xxx and normal indian bhurji.
Triple xxx consists of 3 layers the bhurji, omlete and a half fry! It was realy awesome and filling. The normal bhurji was...read more"
"The things u get here r pretty good in taste . guys are pretty hospitable too. they need to work a bit on hygiene .

Do try the Anda gotala and the Ande ka Funda special."
"Triplexxx, lighthouse, double decker what ever u have here .. It's all awesome here.
Full marks for the creativity
Full marks for the passion
Full marks for the hospitality
For the love of eggs, these guys are genius. Ambience could get better."
I have gone there 3 or 4 times.It's nice place to eat various types of egg dishes . I suggest they must start with chichen dishes. Ma experience was pretty good sometime we have to wait for our order. I guess that's the compliment for ande ka funda they r getting popular so they don't have time to serve the customers but on that you are not giving any respons to customers here again the bad impression . so they have to handle it properly And Yaaa... but the food is real awesome.that triple Xxx dish is yummy.. and yes if they develop the place than that's cheery on the cake....
"Basically the ambience is not pretty great for a family seating & it's a non A/C restaurant but except for this the food here is all varieties of egg dishes & that is good. a good initiative new dishes , taste of the food is here is good , young fellas should definitely try out here."
Stupid place! Closed during open hours! Change your timings & don't bother the customer. No one answers calls! Why put the phone no if it's not meant to be answered?
"Ande ka jalva.

As it happens so with every other only-egg restaurants, this place is again famous for the quality and quantity of servings among the people who guiltily gobble them while being cautious and others who are on a tight budget after having smoked a cigarette too many.

As with every other egg place, there is a huge tava ready with sizzling butter to do your bidding. The metal tables aren't shabby and the chairs won't break under your weight. The menu has fancy names foe what you already know might be egg bhurji or omelette. Your eyes will pop at how cheap they are.

I had the cheese bhurji. Now how many eggs were there in this!? Overflowing with mashed veggies, eggs, butter...read more"
