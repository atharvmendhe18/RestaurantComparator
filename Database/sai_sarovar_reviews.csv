Review
The Palak khichri was too dry and the masala papad was okayish
although i called and said makr very kess spicy it was very very spicy
"We ordered 1 cheese Masala Dosa, Sada dosa - It did not have cheese in it!
The chatni was stinking and was stale
The dosas were all burnt.
They did not even bother to listen and however on asking them to compensate they sent a cheese dosa which again had minimal cheese and the dosa was burnt. On calling and complaining Mr. Pushparaj Shetty he said that this is the kind of food they serve and no changes can be made. Whereas the delivery boy accepted that the food was stale, burnt and did not have enough cheese.
The manager did not communicate properly and was not accepting his mistake.
Third class service no good facility. Worst hotel ever."

"Amazing food...good service...Not much crowded...Decent place..
The staff is really good...and the quantity as well as quality both upto to the mark..."
"Friendly crew, nice & tasty food but a bit expensive. Loved the ambience though
It‚Äôs pocket friendly but only good for vegetarians and if any non-veg lovers try paneer tikka and such dishes..."
"I tried 3 different dishes...

Paneer biryani....it was great though but i think it should be a bit more spicy as i didn't fell any spicy flavour in it...rest was good except spicy

Rawa cheese dosa...well not a fan of south indian dishes but i k8nd of liked it...liked the taste with cheese.. without cheese i cant say about it...

Finally jain pav bhaji...thats the thing i regret about...it was nothing but just the tomato in it...i only felt tomato in the bhaji..no taste except tomato... that's not how you make jain bhaji.. Telling the truth i couldn't eat it ...it was so weird in taste"
"Upto the mark, no regrets"
I have order Jain it's non Jain
"Good food variety and reasonable price. Delievered the food on time and hot. Cooperative and polite staff. Chinese,punjabi,and snacks item served here."
"Best place to be for some cheap sizzlers.. although sizzlers are not that fancy
..all are chinese styled, yet cheaper comparatively than other restaurants"
"Came across this place when actually I lost my way and hunger pangs started.

This place has the most amazing Pav bhaji in Malad area. I have tasted Pav bhaji of at least 20 places before I stumbled upon this place.

Now it is my go to place for Pav bhaji. :)
Ambience 3/5
Taste 4/5"

nice food paneer bhaji and tandoori roti kabbab and chocolate ice cream tasty quick service and polite servers I loved the restaurant thankyou
"Definitely the worst restaurant of malad. Service is slower than snail.
Extremely unprofessional staff.
The worst part you order a JAIN rava sada dosa... And these dumb ppl give u ONION rava dosa...

Dont ever visit this completely shitty place"
"A very nice and calm place to visit with family and friends. The service is really good. The food here is fresh, tasty and a great value for the price. Some of the specialities are paneer sholey,paneer pasanda. To sum up, it is a 3.5/5 stars place."

"Welcomed by the manager with warm smiles to begin with. Lovely to see on a busy Saturday night.
Chinese was on our minds today so we started with manchow soup and paneer baby corn chilly dry.
Both were amazing.
Veg tikki and mushroom baby corn tikka were okayish.
The manager recommended Lucknowvi biryani and was worth it.. paneer mushroom baby corn cheese chilli sizzzler accompanied with paneer baby corn gravy.. overall the food was fulfilling and up to the mark.
Will definitely visit again."
"Promt delivery
North Indian dishesh are good in taste
Reasonably priced

They need to improve their samber quality it's not like South Indian samber.
Medu wada is good ."
"A Mid sized restaurant located inside the lane near liberty garden. The interiors were good enough and had two separate sections. We had ordered the following:-
1)Veg Tawa - A curry with onions,beans,peas,babycorn and paneer. Was good in looks as well as taste. Could had been a bit spicier.Rating-(3.5/5)
2)Naan :- Was soft and regular in size
3)Roti:- Was well cooked and soft as well.
Overall the service is quick enough.
Food-3.5/5
Ambience-3.5/5
Service-4/5"
"It's just next to my building but I prefer ordering instead of going there and eat because the dishes and glasses they use are very old, not so clean. But the food is tasty.
