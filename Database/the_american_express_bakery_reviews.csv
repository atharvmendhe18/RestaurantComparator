Review
"Had taken the Orange pound cake and a Cinnamon sorta pound cake. Both were dry, stale and because of that tasted so bad. We took a bite and threw the whole thing away. The bakery next to and opposite are much better and have fresher options. Never going here ever again!"
"American Express bakery is located at the busy Hill Road , near Holy family hospital. The quality has gone down over the years and not much of a hot spot anymore. The opposite bakery's serve better tasting food items.

Its time for them to take more efforts in maintaining the old standard."
"We have been regulars at AEB for the last 30 Years and our Experience with them have been Awesome.
We like their Christmas Treats- Xmas Pudding, which is Moist and Sticky- the way it should be and Year after Year, they Score 5:5.
Their Stollen is Excellent and so is their Orange Almond Flour Cake.
We like their Fruit Mince Pies, available only during this Festive Season."
"Old fashioned bakery that has great prices for yummy fresh baked goods. Had their chicken patties, Chocolate cake and couple of different sandwiches. Friend had lemon tart and veg baked roll."
"To keep the review short and simple. There are couple of draw-backs of this place. I purchased a couple of tutti fruti buns and walnut brownies. Both were a least a day old.
I am also not sure of why the establishment insists on cash when there are so many forms of digital payment. I could have purchased more things"

"As a rule I don't come on Zomato or any other platforms. But I was present when the nasty, narcissistic, entitled millennium below came into AEB Bandra and feel compelled to write the truth.

Today I went in for my weekly visit and staff told me she wrote a review then realized they do not engage on Zomato so PM to tell them she is going to destroy their business! They asked her if she did not like what she saw (wrote stale looking food) why did she not walk out, apparently she felt bad to do so. So being nasty is a better alternative to her.

I was there-she walked in made the staff pack changed her mind, unpack, pack something else, repack, their bags, boxes, nothing up to her...read more"
"I went to pick up some bakes in the evening there is a lady who is the rudest and the worst hospitable women I have come across in my life. First of all the bakery items looked stale and old and disgusting, on top of that her behaviour was appalling. I asked her to put the bakes in a nice box to which she replied sorry they will only be served in these dirty dingy paper bags. She asked me to talk to her through a separate door away from other customers .. what sort of behaviour is that ? Unbelievable in today‚Äôs age of dignity and respect, this is what you get. Being in hospitality myself we all know how important is it to be hospitable to people when you serve, that‚Äôs the least you...read more"
The brownies were stale and rugged. They were also slightly tangy and definitely not fresh. Please work on your stock management and don't give away stale food to customers.
"Croissant were like rocks... stiff and hard.
The puff was raw and stale.
Quality was poor compared to Hearsh and Andora even A1 bakery.
Only the chicken Patrice was average but not the original taste as they had put some strong masala in it."
""
"The taste was okay, also the cakes were less creamy. Chocolate cake had more cinnamon than actual chocolate."
What an attitude of the owner as if she is doing a favour by selling her goods.Better she keeps away and allows her staff to sell

"Never ever has such bad tart
I had high expectations from this place and ordered a spinach mushroom tart
Which was so dry and tasteless
I mean I couldn‚Äôt even have the second bite and waste of 70/-"
"Visited their store and bought the Christmas plum cake and the fruit mince pie. Both were very fresh soft. Tasty. Also it is reasonably priced. Service was quick and the staff is polite. Have tried their lemon tart earlier it is really good
Yummy stuff. Merry Christmas to the staff and team at AEB"
"The marzipan has ZERO cashew content, the blueberry muffins have ZERO blueberries, the prawn Patties have ZERO prawns and so on and so forth... Seeing a pattern here? The only redeeming item this place has going for it is the bread. But then again...on hill road there are multiple other bakeries with good bread. I think it's time American Express revamp their recipes."
"We would recommend picking up stuff yourself. They very conveniently forget to pack stuff up for you. Invariably an item or two is missing. The quality is also going down the drain. A1 is next door. Better, cheaper, friendlier."
""
"I've only tried lemon tarts and bread puddings from here. I've loved both! It's taste and quality has stayed consistent over time.
My trip to Bandra is never complete without having a delicious lemon tart from here."

Amazing Place. It has a very classy vibe which you'd notice as soon as you walk in through their door. There's so many varieties of baked goods to choose from. Personally I liked the Apple Pie and the Chicken Quiche they have but that's subjective. It does not have tables but it has a bench where you can sit and communicate with someone for a while. It's a great place to be at.
"Good place for a quick snack or to get some good desserts.

The service is good, and really fast since everything is pretty much ready.

The bacon and chicken muffin was okay. It was pretty unique, but subjectively not very exciting.
Same for the cheese croissant. Good for what it was, but not recommended.
The lemon tart was significantly better. It's a good item, worth trying. The other desserts (brownies, cheesecakes) also looked tempting. Will try when I visit again.
They also sell other bakery items like breads and biscuits.

Prices are reasonable, and ambiance is good; it has a nice wooden theme, and an imperial feel to it

Overall nice place, worth visiting once"
Scrumptious
"The puffs with arrive in the evening are fresh but the next day morning they are from the fridge and not quiet able to be noticed and don't taste freshly baked the fresh ones come after 4pm in the evening frm the main kitchen in byculla this for months going here, the price is also to high for the quality, the cheese cake has curd and no cheese flavour, but it's cheaper than other bakers selling cheese cake. Right Plus the bread is the only hot selling item that most ladies come to buy. Other things are individual choices depending on ur pockets."
It's my go to place for a quick fix of soul snacks. Yummiest sandwiches...and Patrice n quiches n desserts to die for. They make awesome coffee too. I go there n sit at that lil table and let my greed take over. It's a foodies paradise.
It has the best food ane best quantity of the food.i love the food and the service of the resturant the server is so fast to serve the food i like the servuce the pizza is so chessy ane tasty iove the place ane i like to visit again eith family ane friends
"Went on the recommendation of a local friend and must say , it's one of the best bakeries I have ever been to . Everything I tastes was sooo good . Their orange cake is the best orange cake I have tried in all my lives .
Loved the cinnamon roll and chicken pattice too .
Deducted one star only for the reason that they run out of items pretty early during the day and if you are going anytime after 4 , a lot of items from the menu won't be available."
"Freshest baked goods. They have a wide variety of dishes available.
Instantly fell in love with them after having their cinnamon bun.

Taste: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 4/5"
"The favourite bakery in bandra. For vegetarians, spinach/mushroom quiches are the best options. Cinnamon roll is the best I've ever eaten. Aside to that garlic toasts are my fav to-go pick for home."
"The american express bakery is good option if you are looking for bakery and fast food food.
I had Sandwiches and Chocolate Muffin during recent visit here and it was good experience."
"It‚Äôs Christmas Eve and everyone is heading towards the mount marry church and hill road is packed as ever.
A friend and I visited this place just before it closed.
We had tried
- blueberry baked cheesecake
-black forest pastry and
-Chicken torte
And lemon tarts.
The place is cute and has great vibes.
The staff is also polite ."
"One of the best bakery in bandra should try their chicken Pattice, chicken torte,wine biscuits andPortuguese sweet bread

Food - 5/5
Taste - 5/5
Quality - 5/5
Service - 5/5 (friendly staff)
Value for money - 5/5"
"This is located in busy street of bandra.
It was my first visit to the american express bakery and try their sandwich and mutton burger.
Food was pocket friendly and taste is worth of money."
"Beware of rats inside! Thought I was mistaken but then I saw it again and so did my friend.
This, after having their chicken puff and chocolate cake which was pretty ordinary for the brand they boast of.
There was no store manager and neither would the boys share the contact number.
Better options available around."
One of the oldest bakery shop in Bandra. Came here th try the black forest pastry which was k .The interiors were k but the service was a bit slow .The staff doesn't care they don't hve the courtesy to tell us about what is not available they only stand and admire to see what ur eating .As if they hve not eaten it before . Over all everything was good . But will never recommended my friend to go to them
"Today i had visited this Small bakery I Ordered for a takeaway I loved Orange soaked tea cake its somethng with best flavour , and i liked my favourite Chocolate muffins ...must visit Friends üëç"
"So disappointed. Visited this place yesterday, found a small hair in the sandwich, after showing it to the appointed chef , they checked and totally ignored it . Also the garlic chicken sandwich tasted really rotten and was so not fresh . So disappointed"
"The American Express Bakery, Bandra is located on the busiest roads of Bandra i.e Hill Rd. Apart from accurate selection of location, the management has appointed extraordinary chefs to control the taste of dishes.
If you are looking for quick bites, maybe a sandwich or a croissant or anything in dessert or some bakery products, then you really have a great option in Bandra- THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BAKERY.
We‚Äôd rate the following as:
Food- 4/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 5/5

A good 4/5 place."
"The chocolate chip sponge cake was really good not sure if its still available.
Tiramisu dessert is good. Service is average.
Located on the main road in bandra west.
Pics coming up."
"I've been coming to this cafe for years. It's one of those places where you have mixed reviews. Some things you like and some you don't. Good crosiants sandwiches and biscuits. Coffee is average. But the experience is unique. Old rustic place with nice wooden furniture.
Must visit once."
"American Express bakery is one of many bakeries in and around bandra. Their puffs are some of the best I have had, be it with a veg or chicken or mutton filling.... all are good.....basically u can try any of their baked items... you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The chicken quiche is lovely. The Hawaiian chicken sandwich deserves a special mention.... their breads are fresh and soft. The bread puddings, tea cakes, muffins, cream rolls... just can‚Äôt stop. Do not forget to pick up the sweet buns for home... my personal favourite. PS: do try the coffee... goes well with everything"
"Must have - mutton Burger üçî / croissant ü•ê
Dessert üç® - tiramisu üçÆ

AMERICAN EXPRESS bakery is a old heritage joint on hill road which is also famous for its bread it serves . It lately more famously know for the hit and run case for people sleeping outside the bakery where a famous Indian actor was involved as well . It‚Äôs a old bandra joint famous amongst people around and college crowd . More over as it‚Äôs amongst the oldest eateries closest to the famous bandstand hangout of bombay ."
"I was roaming around Hill Road in Bandra when I went in for a quick bite. I had a chicken croissant and mango cheesecake. It's a small outlet but the food is really amazing. Would definitely recommend this place, and looking forward to visiting again!"
"If you love breads, this is a must visit. Freshly baked garlic breads, loafs, buns, dinner rolls and a large variety to choose from. The quiche, the puffs and the envelopes are all worth a try. Though, it's mostly a take- away, but it has a couple of seats for you to cool your heels over a cup of coffee n sandwiches. Of course, if you have sweet tooth, try their bread pudding - high on taste, n low sugar ."
This place has a wide range of desserts and savouries at a good price!! And the quality is great too!! The ambience is good as well!! A meal for two will cost close to 400 rs. Enjoy!!
"I first visited American Express when my son was born in 2012. The bakery is right across Holy Family Hospital, and used to be my lunch and dinner place for 3 continuous days back to back.

Although the place doesn‚Äôt boast of a long list of items to choose from, but the good part is that whatever they serve, it is fresh, and packs a punch. During my recent visits, I have tried their Smoked Chicken sandwich, Mutton pattice, Mutton Roast sandwich, Lemon Caramel flan, and Chocolate balls. All the items are delightful to taste buds. Their brownie is second to none in the city.

What I especially like about the place is the warm cosy set-up with their posters from yester-years. It‚Äôs...read more"
"Veg puff tasted good. The spinach quiche was very eggy, tasted horrible. I bought a garlic bread loaf which was delicious when toasted and some veggies. The zucchini pie was tasty. It didnt have an overpowering egg taste and smell."
"Visited this for the first time. I loved their marble brownie. It was soft , fluffy and chocolatey.
I also liked their Chocolate pastry üòã. It was gooey and rich in Chocolate. Loved it. One of the best bakeries to visit."
"It's a small bakery and has been around since ages! There isn't much seating place apart from two benches. It has a very homely feel to it.

We tried their Cheese Crossiant, Cheese Eclairs, Chocolate Eclairs and Kesar Panna Cotta.
I didn't quite like the eclairs. The croissant was good and I loved the Kesar Panna Cotta. Everything is reasonably priced and value for money.

I'd recommend a takeaway."
I would recommend this place to both veg and non veg peeps who love to eat desserts and puffs and rolls sorts of take aways or may be have it der itself
"Nice budget bakery.
Some are good, some are soso... but they have a lot of variation. You can definitely find your favorites here.
Their Hawaiian sandwich is must try!
But they do not care its packaging.
Sometimes it gets disastrous shape when it‚Äôs delivered."
"I always love when I find places to eat that have been around for decades. At such places you know that you will get some incredible food.
This bakery is located on hill road bang opposite holy family hospital.
A very vintage looking place with simple old style classic wooden furniture, woven chairs, glass doored storage for the goodies, wooden bench to sit back and enjoy your treat!
This place has everything from freshly baked bread loaves in a wide variety to quiches, pies, croissants, pattices, puffs, biscuits, cookies, cakes and pastries!y friend ordered the cheese croissant which was loaded with cheese in the centre.however it was a tad bit dry! Next we ordered a Viennese chocolate...read more"
"Great place to enjoy some great desserts and freshly baked products.
You can shop all day on hill road and then fill that hungry tummy with variety of products available here.. they have great range chiken puffs and pie, spinach cheese tart etc

Desserts are yummm
‚úîÔ∏èApple tart - crisp tart cover with tasty apple filling
‚úîÔ∏èCinnamon Roll - a bit too sweet for my taste
‚úîÔ∏èChocolate pastry‚ù§Ô∏è- it was awesome üòç dark chocolate pastry always warms my soul."
"CHICKEN TORTE was an irresistibly delicious treat for a spinach lover like me, owing to the combination of moist and tender chicken chunks and faintly bitter spinach with appealing earthy undertones generously stuffed between a crispy, buttery and flaky pastry exterior. 

CHICKEN QUICHE LORRAINE was an adequately light and fluffy quiche enclosed in a thick yet buttery and tender pie shell with an amazingly moist and creamy centre revealing oodles of cheese and succulent chicken chunks within.

The silky, delicate and smooth LEMON CARAMEL FLAN struck a beautiful balance between the sweet custard and just a faint and easily miss-able lemon-y punch in every bite."
"Even as someone who loves the fine dining at Le Bernadin and Eleven Madison Park, I can always appreciate a good, old-fashioned bakery. Quaint, classy, and with a store in the heart of Bandra, this Portuguese/Goan-inspired gem has been around for decades. Don't expect dessert caviar or gold flakes, just good old-fashioned treats. Though the service can be slow at times, and products at their Bandra outlet run out quickly, great food is always guaranteed. My personal favorite savories include:

Chicken pattice: Amazing flavor and interesting umami, savory flavor, the filo pastry is phenomenally well made
Prawn pattice: Spicy, bold, and loaded with flavor, yet one can still taste the...read more"
"Excellent taste, loved everything specially the lemon caramel flan and the seekh roll. They also serve fresh breads of different varieties. Must try this place whenever u want have a lite bite."
"On my way to work today morning, I picked up a veg pattice and a coffee cake.  I am so disappointed.  The cake was very dry.  The veg pattice was ok.. not that great."
"3 Cheers to the American Express Bakery at Hill Road, Bandra West for returning Rs 500/- paid extra to the counter staff who returned it to me when I again visited the shop after 1 1/2 hours last Thursday !
I love your blueberry cheesecake, lemon tarts and the macaroons.... keep up the good work and thanks to all of you but especially to Mrs Carvalho !"
"The American Express Bakery, a place thats boasts its vintage status in quite a polished yet typically Bombay-Catholic way of hospitality is a great place to visit.
The unconventional varieties of the conventional bakery items, including cakes, pasteries and pizzas makes it, atleast a one-time-must-visit place.
We had 2pizzas, an almond-and-lemon-non-flour cake and some kind of a puff.
We had a huge time indeed !

PS: The owner of the bakery, an old lady whose son looks after the business now, amused us when she paid for whatever she herself ate there üòú"
"Nice place with a lot to choose from..
The wine biscuits are ok..
Butter cookies are a must try..i keep going back for them!
The pie n pastry were just fine!"
"For the first time I had a tastiest mutton burger in India, in Mumbai. Cold burger but juicy tasty n just no words to describe..
Mutton burger 5/5
Cheese croissant 3/5

"The American Express Bakery is a name that tops my list of bakeries in Bandra, since I have been a teenager, now a mother of two grown up kids. Firstly, you get a vast choice of sandwiches, puffs, quiches, a range of breads and desserts... each one of them are worth a try. One actually feels you are having home made stuff. It's all very hygienic and the staff is helpful and pleasant. My kids lunch boxes are packed with their well baked and well presented food once a week!!!! The tea cakes are heaven and one really feels there's nothing that comes close to this place in terms of pricing as well.... their mutton and chicken puffs are a must have. I would recommend this place for sure!!!"
"I bought 3 mousse (2 chocolate ones and one white one), 5 chicken tarts, a chocolate pie and four macroons from this place today morning, the man made a face while packing the items which, I ignored and passed it off as him having a bad day. After paying a bill of 500, the man decided to leave the white mousse out of the packaging. This happened in the Bandra outlet. After asking if the box kept aside was ours, we received no reply from Mr. Moody and thought that it wasn't ours as another customer was at the counter with us as well. After coming home to Borivali and calling Mr. Moody in that shop to inform him that he had left a mousse out, he decided calling my grandfather a liar was the...read more"
"It's sad the way they treat their customers. When I entered the place there were three staff in brown uniform each lost in their own world. Either they're under paid or probably least interested in the job. Had to wait till I could catch one of the staffs attention to place my order. Placed an order for 1 Chicken puff, 1 prawn puff, 1 apple pie, 1 cinnamon roll and 1 quiche, take away. Packed in a brown bag, I was happy to go home n munch on the snacks. But to my bad luck, I realized only after reaching home that the cinnamon roll was missing. To ensure that I paid the right amount I tried looking up the menu .. again unfortunately I couldn't find the cost and hence decided to call up and...read more"
"I have always thought of trying out the stuffs here but used to think they are overrated and overpriced due to it popularity. But recently I decided to go in and give it a try and was surprised to see the pricing. I feel they have priced it at a very reasonable rate without compromising the quality.

I almost tried all the non-veg puffs, rolls and quickies. Though I did felt the mutton puff/roll was little too masala types the chicken and the prawn items were amazing.

I like the vibe of the place and the interior is nicely done. If I were to stay in Bandra this would have been my regular place.

We were looking for Frisbee's to catch some burgers when we spotted this place. Having a sweet tooth we stepped in. It is a very cozy and comfortable place. It has a good selection of pastries and cookies. All its pastries have egg. We had a Tiramisu and a Chocolate Muffin. The Tiramisu was pretty good and the Chocolate muffin was very delicious. They also a range of delicious cookies and pizza tarts. They also have a lot of breads and biscuits.
"Disappointing food with absolutely no value for money. The owner/manager was kind but honestly, the food was not good at all. Picked up two sandwiches, both were bland. The rye, avocado and bacon sandwich was so soggy and tasted like it had been out for weeks! The macaroons were rock hard and not the soft, melt-in-your-mouth macaroon. The lemon pie had pieces of lemon in it which made it so sour and inedible. The cream cheese marble brownie was average, at best. Don't think I'll be going back."
Absolutely love this place...one of my must visit places when in Bandra...All the bakery items are fresh and delicious!! Personal favourite is the Lemon Pie...its too good!!
Always a pleasure to be in American express bakery which was made famous by Salman Khan üòâ. Recently tried the orange & almond flour less cake. It was superb & the consistency is orgasmic to the palate. Definitely a must try.
"A homely, lovely ambience.. Made even more welcoming but the sweet Goan / Catholic owner lady.
Since they didn't have cakes, picked up 6 Hungarian Coffee cakes for my friend's birthday.
So soft, perfect taste of coffee & nuts.. Everybody loved it!"
Well when it comes to genuine patisserie they are the one....from blueberry muffins to silk blueberry cheesecakes beautifully crafted...great macaroons too...good and cheap options in puffs...try the celery and cheese puffs...very little seating arrangements
"Its a decent bakery. It was clean and tidy in a cute little set up. I tried a lot of desserts out of which:
Apple pie - delicious, perfectly sweet with undertones of cinnamon
Coconut cream cake too sweet
orange tea soaked cake - again too sweet
Homemade chocolate cake and cheese brownie - not so great"
Awesome bakery chocolate muffin and walnut brownie was awesome must try i would like to come again and again decor of the shop is also nice well maintainedüòäüòä
"Now the reason why I went to American Express Bakery is because a fellow foodie spoke so highly of their boozy plum cake. But what caught hold of my eyes is this classic chicken torte . Chicken, scrambled eggs, spinach and cheese . All the goodies you can pack in that slice. Such an excellent deal for the 55 bucks it charges. Even their cheese celery roll is darn nice. #foodloose"
"The original patisserie favourite after Merwans for their yummy Lemon Tart. Bitter, with a zesty lemony flavour..yummy. The quick bite favourites are Chicken/Mutton Pattice, Chicken Sheekh Roll and the amazing Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich. Other must try items include the Chicken Salami Sandwich, Mutton roast Sandwich and their line up of cheesecakes."
"If you can look past the deafening silence inside American Express Bakery ever since Salman Khan drove his car into it all those years ago, it'll be something you enjoy. The food is great, and nothing has changed in the last 100 years; neither the prices nor the quality."
"This place is right on hill road and not at all difficult to find .I visited this place in the afternoon and very few items were available. I ordered chicken quiche loriane, tiramisu , chocolate fudge brownie pie and blueberry soufle. Chicken quiche had sausage chicken in it , so if you're a fan of sausages only then order it.Tiramisu was the best out of all the items we tried. I highly recommend tiramisu for everyone who visits here. Overall I found this place quite average.

"A foodie at heart,  I don't understand reviews of this place by ""reviewers who seem to have an abnormally large number of reviews on this site"", unless what they say about some reviewers is true.  One even went as far to say that they frequented this spot a lot. But not one good review from them during all those trips, especially since they have 100+ places they have reviewed.  Just a bad review now.  Hmmm strange you think ?. Their customers who have taken time to write have given great reviews and I agree.
