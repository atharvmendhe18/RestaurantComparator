"WORST PRAWNS PULAO
ONLY PLAIN BIRYANI RICE WITH 6 PRAWNS
NO TASTE AT ALL
WORST FOOD"
"Hi Team, it was a very disgusting experience with the food Chicken Pulao x 3 that we ordered from Saayba Hotel, Bandra as we're (family) regular at this joint. The food served when we'd been physically at the venue was indeed splendid, hence we ordered it through zomato.
Apparently, to our surprise the quantity in each of the 3 boxes was half filled, food was full of garam masala and also the food was delivered so very late. I've now landed to order more food locally.
I'm now in double minds as in should we actually visit Saayba anytime again!!!
sorry to have stated this feedback.....
no value for money and the attendants at Saayba to have no value towards their loyal customers!!!"
Very Nice
"chicken pulav was stale. chicken pieces in sukha & fish pieces in curry wasn't the same as it gets served when one dines in the restaurant.
overall a bad experience."
Bhangda fry was overcooked and burnt. Horrible
horrible quality and taste
Surmai did not seem fresh.
""
"Once the most desired place has gone down the dumps. Pathetic food. The crab curry was onion tomato gravy, the Green Surmai curry was a onion & coconut curry with insufficient coriander in it. A terrible experience"
"Such a gem located in one of the busiest areas of Bandra! The place itself is very homely with food served on good ol' thalis. We ordered two rawa pomfret fries, tisriya sukka, amboli, vade, thecha and gallons and gallons of sol kadhi. The pomfret was fresh and crisp fried. The sukka had more body and spice than the ones you get in Konkan or family-run eateries in Goa but quite nice nonetheless. The ambolis were soft and fresh. The vade was average. The thecha was an acquired taste. Our bill was a little less than 1500. My go-to Gomantak place on the western lines."
""
Been patronizing this restaurant for almost two decades now!!! The taste is super. Delicious and freshly made food is served here. A family run unit. Delivers consistent taste of all/any items ordered. Chicken sukha with amboli is a super combination to go for out here. Also fish fry. A must visit place...
"Dont know for sure , bt i reaching the restaurant at around 11pm must have been the-reason for the chef to prepare the food in a hurry .....as if they had an important meeting to attend / they just wanted to do away with the leftover . I ordered for bombil fry (219) , (wich i recived in less than 2 mins ), & Prawns masala(430, Sunday special) with ( i dnt think ki wo bhi just 5mins me ready ho jata hai ) . Disgusting taste . Disappointed . N 2 non palatable dish costed me around 741rs."
""
"Prawns fry is a must try here. Also, mutton masala is another good dish here, Though it is a seafood restaurant. The thali includes a fish fry, chapatis, rice, sabzi, sol kadhi, thecha and rassa. I tried the pomfret thali, they have many more thalis on the menu. The taste of the thali is average. I think ordering individual dishes is a good choice as they taste delicious and have variety."
"Located near Bandra talao...
this is a very ancient eating hall....
Went here to have Wade and chicken but ended up having fish ...

We ordered the prawns in green masala and ordered crabs in red masala.
Also ordered the solkadi appetiser to go with fish !
The taste was lovely and authentic Maharashtrian. Wade were really good and served hot.
Will visit again to try other items on their menu.

One of the most pathetic food n rude staff. Had ordered prawns sukka n they sent me some unpalatable prawns. Informed the restaurant abt it at that time they agreed for refund within a week but when called them 2 days later they refused to have spoken to me. Complete scam n waste of money
"Saayba is a restaurant has always been visited by the Irani family for over 3 decades now. Infact it's a no fuss dinner and we plan ahead what we are going to order.
Not a very big eatery, it has 10-12 tables and on weekends there is Always a minimum half hour waiting to get inside.
We ordered bombil surmai and rawas fry. What a feast it was enjoying hot crispy fish fry. A tad bit oily though.
Later it was time for prawns xacuti, achari and fish thali with Sol kadi. Quantity was less this time.
The meal was so satisfying and was relished by all.
Thankyou:)"
"Very popular hotel in locality specially known for its sea food coming to the restaurant ambience is quiet simple and service is prompt,coming to food was not satisfied with food taste"
"Visit to the past .. Saayba at reclamation Bandra for quick lunch - Saayba special prawns, fried Rawas and Fried Bombil .. finished off with malai kulfi and gulab jamun .. All absolutely flawless - the prawns were super fresh super yummy !! alongwith beverages came within 1100 bucks !! Rating : üòãüòãüòãüòã"
"Choice of fish preparation was missing. Tawa fry and Rava fry are the most famous two choices one gets when ordered for Fry fish. Saayba has only one option of shallow fry, this is no less than a bhajiya, no masala. Bombay duck was also shallow fried, no masala. The prawns gravy called prawns masala wasn‚Äôt good at all. It felt like - Tomatoes were almost raw and onion remained uncooked. This was like preparation by some novice who learns for cook- very basic.

Had heard a lot about this place but was disappointed. Almost felt like we wasted time to travel and money..

Staff was humble, service was good.

Fish was fresh, soft, cooked well (leave the taste aside)."

Sorry sir but as compared to the price the food is not that great ! Please lower your price for more better experience to the customers. The food was earlier great but now it is deteriorated not recommended anymore.
Best place to have amazing seafood and kombdi wade. Small place but they will never disappointe you. Been there several times everytime food is fresh and tastes good. Sagoti chicken and sagoti wade is my favourite from saayba.Must try for sea food lovers.
"Delicious Seafood. Have tried the pomfret curry, surmai curry, Bombay duck fry...like my friend said.. exquisite.. :)..fresh fish and well-balanced masalas."
"This is our all time favorite Costal food eating House... Very Fresh... SPECIALITY is Prawn fry & Bombil fry (Bombay Duck)... Food is very homely... Service is very decent & Prompt. Reasonable, compare to any other Non-Veg restaurant.. Family friendly... Decent ambience... Owner is very polite & soft spoken... 5 star rating üëç"
Had been here for dinner the place small with few seatings. Only one fish thali option others were not available most of the food we asked for was not there. We had asked for bombil fry which was less on salt half burnt so we left only eating that i feel the place is not worth now
"After visiting couple of times this visit was the worst experience. Quality of the Non-Veg food is downgraded along with the quantity, price remains the same.

Suggestions :
- Quality of the food needs to be improved
- Need to decrease the wait time for thali (Veg & Non Veg)
- Please change the steel thali, use other crockery"
"If you are VEGETARIAN please do not visit.

I had order : 
- Paneer Mutter Masala
- Vadi (Type of puri)
- Paneer Veg Pulao

Review :
- Paneer in Paneer Mutter Masala was like rubber
- Paneer in Paneer Veg Pulao was like rubber too but Pulao was super spicy
- Service was super slow
- No cleanliness in infrastructure
- Servers dress was not clean
- AC was not properly managed"
"Decent place to eat some authentic coastal cuisine. Price is slightly high, food taste is also ok. The best thing is that the seafood is fresh."
"Its a decent place serving decent food.If you are a sea food lover or like Malvani cuisine then you must try this place.

Well since I am not a fan of Malvani food I personally did not enjoy the food though it was good.

I liked their Surmai fry, its was very good."
"I have been visiting this place since I was kid and can say that over the years this place has only become better. A simple quaint place with simple ambience. Great place for sea food lovers. What I also like about this place is that it‚Äôs clean and hygienic even though it‚Äôs smaller.

Stop by this place if you are in the vicinity and do try their fish fry, fish gravy and bhakri or vade. Wash it down with their refreshing sol kadhi.

This place will never disappoint you!!"
"Quick lunch at this iconic place located in Bandra West ! We straight opted thali & not to miss the fried bombay ducks !

- Chicken & Vade #must try
- Bombay duck

"Went to this place yesterday with my family food is decent on taste though the spice on the palate is high in some of the dishes we ordered for chicken masala fry , shell fish masala,Prawns fry which costed 439 Rs. Which is obnoxiously high for mere 10 pieces of prawns management has to seriously look into the pricing. Otherwise the food was fine"
"Good places for sea food lovers but everything is deep fried here.. For those who like less oily, tava fried fish..this is not the place.. But having said that the preparations are very tasty.. And the fish pulao is awesome..."
"This place in Bandra has a very home like vibe with a very friendly staff. The super delicious Seafood Thali at Saayba is extremely pocket friendly. You get Pomfret curry, Kingfish fry, Sol kadhi, 2 chapattis, a bowl of rice and a bowl of extra fish curry. Everything on their menu does justice to the taste buds of a seafood lover. The taste is very homemade, so you actually feel like you are eating at home or at a friends house.

Excellent seafood. The tisrya masala/ sukke are a must try with a plate of steaming hot vade. Friendly staff and the best malvani food ever!! Be sure to get there a little early to avoid waiting.
"Went it there for lunch at around 2ish had waiting of 10 mins. Food is good some hotels lack in salt content when it comes to fish but not this one. I wanted to try Mutton Thali but sadly it got over so hopefully next.
I tried Fish Thali which comes with Surmai Fry & Curry(portion of fish) with 2 chapatis (Can't swap them for bhakri) Rice & Sol kadhi. I also ordered Bombil Fry. Fish fry were yum perfectly marinated. Chapatis rice average. Fish curry could have been better. Sol kadhi very very Nice üëå.
Owners are courteous & warm."
"The bangda tikle won my heart because after ages ate something that came close to what mom makes, the fiery spicy bangda n then the fleshy clean tisrya,uff yummy. The solkadhi too was exactly how we goans make.marinate ur fish fry a bit with kokam but was yummy nonetheless"
"A no frill hotel serving good sea food dishes and some amazing veg & non veg thali in the most visited bylanes of Bandra.

Ambience (3/5) : It's simple and has decent seating arrangements, a bit noisy as the tables are close to each other. A place you step in for a quick bite get your money‚Äôs worth and move out.

"Saayba is one of those cheap, value-for-money places in Bandra that provides really good Mahrashtrian and Konkan food. Their fish thalis are exceptionally good along with most of their seafood dishes. Try their bombil, rawas or surmai fry for starters. In the mains, we quite liked Prawns Achari with soft Rice Bhakari."
We visited this place for dinner tonight. We ordered the boneless chicken fry and prawns masala. The prawns were good. The chicken fry was modified a bit as per our request. It was not what were wanted. Instead of a coconut gravy we got a tomato based gravy. The Bombay duck fry was very tasty. Overall a very harty meal.
"A very famous fish joint located in Bandra West, near the station. Be prepared to wait here till you get your seating inside. No matter which day you go you have to wair.

Ambience 3/5 It's simple and has decent sitting arrangements. Nothing fancy here. It's quite noisy as the tables are really close to each other. So it's a typical place to order ,eat ,pay your bill and move out.

Service 4/5 No complains but it's like a fast train here , order fast, eat fast n leave since others are waiting. Fast and prompt service. Just like the fast life we are living in Mumbai.

"One of the least appreciated place because of being overshadowed by a popular Biryani joint in the same location, but nonetheless I would definetly recommend if you want to try out Malvani style fish in Bandra. Not overhyped , pocket friendly and without any fuss, this restaurant sticks strictly to the preparation. Try their stuffed pomfret fried and bombil fry. Also their Thalis are sumptuous."

"Visit Day Date and Time:- Saturday 19-May-18, 1.30 pm

‚ÄúSaayba Hotel‚Äù another hidden gem and legendary restaurant for all the sea food lovers of Mumbai. This place has been operating since past 3 decades and is located on the SV Road in Bandra opposed to Jhama Masjid.

Ambience:- Simple and Basic

We tried out following from the menu:-
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Chicken Masala Sagoti:- Its basically chicken gravy which is cooked slowly and has coconut as base. It was appetising and went well with Wade.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Bombil Fry:- Bombil is regional name for Bombay Duck Fish. It was fried to perfection keeping its softness intact.

Recommendations:- Chicken Masala Sagoti with Wade

Service:- Good

Experience:-...read more"
I had Chicken Saguti Masala & Vade. But just two good pieces in the Chicken Masala which costs Rs 239. Rest were bones. Not worth at all. The ambience is ok. Staff are courteous.
"One sholud visit here only for sea food and that too for only having Prawns and Crabs that are good.
Other food are also good but not upto the mark.
Anyways my favourites are only prawns.
#Saayba"
"Saayba hotel is located in Bandra on the main road . It has been there for years and serves great sea food.

Their fish thalis are worth a try . Fried fish is amazing !The prices are a bit high .

The place gets crowded so one must account for the waiting time .

Service is quick ambience is ok!"
"It's not a cozy place. We went there to have seafood as we had a lot of good reviews from acquaintances, bit were highly disappointed.
The presentation of the food was adept but it did not taste that good.
We asked for a chicken starter. We asked the waiter not to make it spicy as we need for my son, he just got chicken that was boiled and fried it had no taste at all. My son rejected it out right.
We ordered rawas, Bombay duck, and prawns after that.

When we eat the fish we had to look for the fish within the thick coating of rawa.

Prawns was good and everyone liked it."
"surmai, rawas, prawns, banda, halwa, Bombay duck, shell fish I jst can't stop naming but seriously it has totally mouth melting dishes for all seafood and fish lover must definitely visit here I tried prawns curry, and surmai green masala and veg thali surprise part there is sonkadi too and they also serve non veg thali as well..!!"
"A very good place for having fish located opposite bandra mosque. This place has been running since decades. The quality is still very good. The staff will properly explain you regarding any particular dish you wish to know about.
The fish thali is a very good option. Things.to try: Promfret/Surmai rawa fry. Chicken sagoti, clams sukkha, Prawns curry with rice, Solkadi.
They also serve a decent chicken thali and a good veg@ thali. So there is something for everyone."
"Was in Bandra for few days nd always wondered if Bandra had any authentic Gomantak Hotel. Luckily after few days noticed dis place. Came down early FM office on Monday and it was closed, it's der weekly off. So next day had my Tuesday ka lunch, orders fish thali. They served me with Big portion of Surmai fry, Surmai gravy, solkadi, extra amti, hot soft chappati, and rice.
The taste was Authentic, fish was really fresh and tasty, the waiters were warm nd happy to serve, good place to dine with family, very clean and hygienic."

One star is also too much to give.. The food quality has deteriorated to the worst seafood in Mumbai. Once upon a time we used to crave for the food. Today the stuff juz fills ur stomach but fails massively to fill ur taste buds and foodgasm. The prices are sky rocketing and the quality does not enhance proportionately. Kindly choose some other places for ur malvani taste buds. This place is not worth it. Juz a brand name with empty insides.
Service is good but normal one small plate/vati rice is Rs.60. This is too much. They should make Goan curry little more tasty. It was just plain spicy tastless curry.
Typical malvani food. Fish was fresh and crisp. Prawns were not marinated just added to gravy. Taste was ok. Average place to eat. Location is easy.
"Saayba
one of the oldest restaurant to be serving authentic sea food in mumbai. For years n years the name n its taste stays for tasty malvani style sea food. Simple yet ample seating area good for a family food outing.
Service n quick n apt n the staff is friendly and on their toes to fullfill your requests. The dishes we tried
- surmai red gravy
- rawas gravy
- crab masala
- king prawn red gravy
- with chapatis n rice bhakris
- prawns fry
- bombil fry
- solkadi(trditional drink)"
"Been a while since we've been to @Saayba for a meal, so visited with family for a Sunday Lunch.

The interiors of the place or service has not changed much over the years, but the there's a marked difference in the food quality.

The Fish thali was strictly ok.. Wadas and Prawn Biryani were nice, but the Fried Prawns and Mutton Sukha was the best!"
"Had heard a lot about this place so we went there for lunch on a working day. Ambience and the rest of the place was quite average, the worst part was food. We ordered Fish Curry, Fried Pomfret, Clam Curry and Amboli. Fist curry was the worst of the lot...zero on taste, no salt, no character, just nothing. Fried fish was again deviod of any taste at all. Amboli was more like Dosa. Clam Curry was somewhat better. To top it all, it was over priced. Never recommend anyone this place..."
I recently have been to the place during monsoon and one of the pathetic experience i had was with cleanliness. We ordered our lunch and after it was served on the table we had flies running out here and there. We also informed staff about it and still they reacted as helpless. Definitely will not recommend this place in monsoon. Avoid this place in monsoon if you do not want to dine with flies on your plates.
Saayba hotel is famous for sea foods. Located close to station. Fast service. The seafoods are so good. For the price we pay. Staff are good.
The food is good but they don't deliver always. Today I called and they refused to deliver. I live very close the hotel. They should hire more staff.
"Good malvani Marathi food. It's the type that's in my dad's go to book for malvani food. The fish here is food, no matter which one you have. We usually go for the rava fried pomfret.

In the top 10 coastal cuisine restaurants in Mumbai"
"I hate giving bad review but nothing is as disappointing as a ""has been"" ... the revamped menu has made this once outstanding seafood joint very commercial and generic... positives are that its clean with fresh fish... as a Saayba fan I hate that this landmark has lost its soulüòî... I can't say I will be seen in the queue outside.

If you do go there anyway, I'd recommend the veg thali, the prawn chutney stuffed pomfret and (the saving grace) amboli"
Been here sometime back. Not worth your money. Late service. Small portions. Decent ambiance. Was disappointed. Could give this place a miss.
"Our go-to place for malvani style lip smacking sea food. The pompret red tikhala is a must have. Oyster masala is delicious too. Fried bombil is absolute heaven. This place has maintained the quality of food over each passing year. Their mutton thali & vade is sought after too. Truly a sea food lovers Paradise!!
Only parking is an issue, so you might consider not taking your own vehicle there."
"Located near Bandra station Saayba is a simple restaurant serving really good dishes of fish.

We called for Rawas curry in green preparation which was really yummy. Had chapati and ambolis with it. Ambolis were served hot... were soft and really good.

Ordered Surmai fry, bombil fry and prawns fry too. Crispy .. hot and fresh fish.

We also had prawn curry rice, it was simply delicious.

Loved the overall food. Very good quality of fish served.

We had malai kulfi and kesar kharvas. Would highly recommend the kharvas as it is one of the best I've had. The perfect amount of sweet and amazing taste."
"Lip smacking Malvani food... a must try for every sea food lover.. crispy Bambay duck fry, crispy vade, chicken and mutton sukkha masala, prawns masala, egg pulao and in the end their authentic solkadi just makes ur day.... Great ambience and reasonable price are two of the many things that the place offers to make ur day"
"This place has no branches and it is known for its coastal konkani food.
We ordered chicken pakoda which is chunks of chicken marinated coated with semolina and deep fried was ok as chicken was hard.
Prawn curry was average
Solkadi was good.
Chicken salgoti was good"
"Parking is the major issue if you are not in the mood to wait, don't visit! Food can be better. Service and ambience is average. Solve the parking issue because the area is crowded anyway on peak hours."
Parking is an issue here as it is located near lucky restaurant on the busy bandra talao road. Amazing finger licking affordable malvani food!!
"Considering the food was quite bad at the last 3-4 restaurants I visited, this place was a major relief. As it says, it's mainly a place for seafood, but it's definitely good quality seafood. Worth every penny spent.the food is tasty and fresh. Not disappointed with anything we ordered. And it's reasonably priced. Worth a visit. And they have a valet too, so parking is not an issue."
"the taste is nice, but i hate one fact i.e they dont remove the thread ( POOP OF THE PRAWN) of the prawns, when i asked the waiter as to why that was the case he called the owner of the place and he said "" we
never ever remove the thread , this is the way we serve since years ""
His atrutude was really bad i.e the owners the way he sait it was "" i dont care about what u think but i woll continue my unhygienic pratice as i have been sping this since years ""
I would love yo black list the restaurant the worse so far . that is the reason i totally dislike going to this restaurant. 
hygiene is a major issue here.
 this restaurant and that the reason we have stopped .
so be careful before...read more"
"Been visiting this place since my childhood and my dad got parcels too.. Food is always amazing if you enjoy Malvani fare.

Staple order remains Chicken Xacuti Masala (gravy) and Vade.

Ofcourse you can also try Chicken Suka and it's Mutton variants as well. Fish curries are also well made. N fried fishes are a must try too. Prawns/Surmai/Rawas are my favourite.

Sol kadhi which is an appetiser should be tried too."
"Last night while driving past Bandra Majid area with my family , we passed by Saayba. So I decided to drop and have a look at the restaurant since I had heard a lot about this restaurant from my friend Najeebah Kerawalla and plus we were heading for dinner either ways .

From the exteriors it seems like any other small time shady restaurant but just from a peep inside, I was rest assured that I could bring in my family members who were waiting in the car for a green single to enter the restaurant. On being seated, the waiter was prompt in bringing 4 menu cards and water. Though restaurant was small the tables were well laid out and the space was well managed.

Not deviating too much...read more"
This is a place for fish lovers..if you wanna eat a fish in mumbai ...eat here...tasty and reasonable .. stuffed pomfret is a must try even tisrya masala..
"Good Malvani food. Try their Chicken Sagoti (thick gravy). Service is good and friendly staff. If you're in Bandra, it's a place that can't be missed!"
"Maalvan food on a gloomy day, just what the doctor ordered to cheer you up and lighten your spirits. One has to wait a while to get a table there, but it is totally worth the wait.

Saayba, is a quaint little place on an extremely busy road, so its best to use a cab or rick to get there. Basic seating inside, but that didn't matter once the food arrived.

The surmai was great, the chicken was brilliant and the pulaos were good and the overall experience of dining there was fantastic.

Price wise, it isn't that bad for the kind of food you get to eat there. All in all, a good experience, next time around will order the red and green curry with some rice instead. Slurp..."
"This Place is sooo good the food is fabulous the prawns fry is soo good, The Chicken Dry Roast was superb Prawns Balchao it was Rocking and in desserts Three in one kulfi with pista, Malai & kesar is must try Will definitely return to this place. :D:):-)
Best Regards

"The fried prawns were yummm. The food was overall very tasty. But, I felt that it was overpriced for the quantity that they serve. And maybe because of it's location. So, if you have a big group, be prepared to spend a bombshell. Also, don't forget the taxes. Gomantak, Dadar is comparatively better in all aspects."
"I stepped into this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon to have a quick lunch. This restaurant is well known in the area for its seafood.

This place is cosy with comfortable seating. It is an air conditioned eating house, there are washrooms and the staff is courteous.

Being single, I ordered one dish - the Prawns Pulao. It was perfect for one person - not too much and not too less. The Prawns were tasty and done right. The flavors are more on the spicier side since this is Gomantak cuisine.

Overall a good place for lunch if you are in the mood for sea food without being exceptional."
"Full ratings for serving us at the closing time. This hidden gem serves excellent seafood. As much I would have loved to share the pictures we didn't even get time to click, we were so Hungry. We loved the preparations starting from the Bombay duck fry, prawn balchao, tisrya suka (shell fish preparation) it was lovely. The distinct flavour of masalas were prominent. Fish was fried to perfection and to top it up the solkadi Perfection. Highly recommend this place for seafood lovers."
