"Very bad experience with the Hotel Akarshan, Vikhroli West. There had been always any hygiene issue further early this week when three of our friends (Anup Shetty, Ganesh Talekar, Shailender Aadhi) visited this hotel in the evening we found cockroach in the 90 ml liquor which they served. Sad part was that they were least bothered and were debating instead of replacing it with a sealed quarter bottle. You will also find small rats moving around the seating places.
And were so arrogant saying you can complaint anywhere nothing will happen to them.
This was a very bad approach by them and seriously bad experience with a lesson well learnt and swear will never visit this restaurant ever....read more"

The packaging was not properly done and one soup spilled all out in the package. Extremely dissatisfied with the experience and would recommend the restaurant to please work on this in the future

Chicken Tandoori Taste is awesome. Properly cooked and good quality food.
"I've visited this place just before lockdown.
Akarshan is situated near Vikhroli railway station in west side. The food quality is good.
Prices are also affordable. They have a nice and decent ambiance, only issue is they have Bar and restaurant together so you might witness drunk crowd at times, so its better if you visit before 8 pm incase you are with family. I've had below dishes and all were Tastyy üòã
1. Chicken Crispy
2. Chicken Hyderabadi
3. Butter Nan
4.Chicken Tandoori
5. Jeera Rice

I really liked the Chicken dishes, the chicken was fresh and was cooked properly. Nan was Crispy and the were dipped in butter so it was delicious. The food was delivered within time and we...read more"

"Orderd prwans briyani ,its just did not tastes like it used to tast before ,prwans were not cooked properly."
Akarshan is the place located near vikhroli station. Its is a best restaurant for family and friends. Food is amazing and it has exotic ambiance.

"I ordered online food worth RS 2k on last Saturday.
And waited around 1 hr and then they cancelled order.
Just Because of hotel managers carelessness towards work.
The only thing he was saying that ye mera duty nai h ..online orders wala aadmi aaj aaya nai.
Like seriously then you should have not accepted my order if u had no knowledge about it.
Worst experience.
Worst staff.
I would not blame the delivery boy because they do just pickup and drop.
But This educated dumb staff hats off to them."

Never Try this Place. Door keeper is allowing people those who are are paying extra money to him. 2 table were vacant still he ask me to to wait for half an hour.
Good ambience with cheap rates but a very good food quality.services provided by staff were good.it is located close to Vikhroli station West.
Nice food and good service. In love with mouth melting prawns koliwadaüòç. Near station but car parking issues. But overall amazing place to visit for delicious food.
"Ambience- 4/5
Service -2/5
Starters quality & taste - 3/5
Main course- 1/5
It is too costly as far as taste,quantity & quality is concerned
Service is too slow,you have to wait & only wait
Unless you continuously ask manager about order you wont get response & your order will keep on delying
Dont waste your money here"

"I visited yesterday at this hotel. I ordered murgh musallam
The worst thing is that the murgh musallam in this not only chicken by there is fish tale also. Pathetic is this doesn't even apologize for the staff of the hotel.so so disappointed with their services, food and everything."

"Restaurant located at 2 mins distance from Vikhroli railway station. Simple and spacious ambiance with comfortable seating arrangement. Service is good and quick.

I got little bad experience while having food. We ordered Daal khichdi at the end, in which I found stone in my mouth which was disappointing and moreover to this when I informed this to manager he said we can make new for you but once you get such experience then I had no wish to hvae more.

I tried following delicacies:
#Prawns Masala: When I ordered masala, our expectations were with thick gravy but when it arrived on table it was not such. Prawns were fresh but gravy was very average in taste."
"This place is nearest vikroli station...best place for food...
Planner chilli:‚Çπ270
Veg fried rice:‚Çπ220
Chicken pattialla:‚Çπ350
Hungry Mumbaikars must visit this place"
"It's an AC and Non AC hotel the food is class and A1 with reasonable rates. Hot,Chilli and spicy.We had chicken tandoori and akarshan special which was awesome. The staff was humble and polite to us.It is near tu vikhroli station"
"After a movie at Rcity we reached vikroli station looking for a place to have lunch we landed up at this restaurant

A decent place near the railway station to have lunch or dinner.

It has two sections AC and Non AC. The ambience of this place is okish not that great. Coming to the food and service it did not disappoint and it was ok fir the price we paid."
A good place for a fine dine in Vikhroli. Taste of the food is good but the service is a bit slow. Chicken was very fresh and the quality is also very good compared to price.
This place is near vikhroli station serves both veg and non veg food items service is good food is also tasty ambience is not that bad this place is good for non vegetarian and price is food is pocket friendly
We tried out their veg kolhapuri which was so disgusting. There was so less salt. There was no taste in that veg kolhapuri which was absolutely filled with panner and lots of them.
Pretty good place to have dinner/lunch with your family.... üòã.... And the ambience is also pretty good and the staff was friendly and energetic too.... The quality of the food was Perfect and... The drinks where also Fresh... üç∫.... This place is recommended for family (75%) and for friends (25%)..... üëçüíó
One of the best restautrant in vikhroli west next to station. Quick service and food is also best quality. We had order chicken lollipop and the taste was jst yuum....üòã
"Usually sometime we people from office used to go only to Mohini Vilas restaurant for lunch but today we tried this one ..n that was good experience...we ordered chicken lollipop and chicken gold coin in starter both was good but we like chicken lollipop only..n in main course we tried chicken and egg biryani Both was average..
Ambience was peaceful.."
Me and my family always used this place for family dinner. We like the food and service. This place is best for vegetarian people's and also for non vegetarian people's. Good taste and also quality food. Service is on time. Staff is also polite. ;)
"Have been to this place a number of times over the years.
However, the quality of food has gone down substantially, especially after they closed the veg and chat counter in their restaurant.
I prefer ordering food or takeaway instead of visiting this place. The ambience isn't appealing."
Very good service! It‚Äôs a very good place to be with family on birthdays or any function. I specially liked the Punjabi and Chinese dishes a lot
"It is located near Vikhroli station. It has 1+1 and the 1st floor has air conditioner so we prefer to have a seat there. Ambience was good. We tried
Paneer makhanwala
Veg Manchurian
Butter roti
Butter naan
Butter kulcha
Food was below average
They can improve their quality of food
Service was above average"
"It was a Great experience today dinner with my friends food was delicious and so yummy and the service by the Mr amar it's amazing amar is very polite and take cearing..
Am definitely visit again...."
"They should be ashamed of charging 30 rs a bottle of water. When they were asked to deduct the amount they replied "" We give a good place for you to sit and we do Service so we have right to charge above MRP"". Such a stupid management.

Location : Outside Vikhroli station (W)

Ordered :
Veg - Masala Papad, Manchow soup, Pahadi Paneer Tikka, Hara Bhara Kabab, Roti Naan, Paneer Hyderabadi, Kaju Masala, Jeera Rice.

Non veg - Chicken muth Muslum, Chicken Manchow soup, Pahadi kabab, Reshmi kabab, Chicken Tandoori

Review : So they are rated 2 only for the non veg and hara bara kabab veg dish. Rest all food items are taste less. Please don't try the above mention atleast.

"Very fine dine restaurant to take your family here, not that much costly and not cheap also but average prices they have, taste i will give him 3.55 for the taste of the food well decorated restaurant.
I've tried paneer tikka, paneer chilli and paneer koftas with roti, you'll find quality while eating
And about ambience its too close to the vikhroli station and one of the most attractive restaurants in that area and popular too for family dinners, the have party hall to but you have do pre bookings for the ceremony or something"
