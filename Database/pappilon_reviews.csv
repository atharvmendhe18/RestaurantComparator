superb taste and quantity . Worth it
Food is smelling
First of all there was not much butter in the bhaji and the worst part was masala pav….which was just diped into some spicy masala which was of no taste….. I spend 100 rs more for masala pav but it was not at all worth…..although it spoiled bhaji also

Tasteless food…no salt no sauces nothing…disappointing…

"Actually the quantity which I usually get in dine in is very less as compared to delivery. Also the pav bhaji was not tasty, infact jt wasn't even hot and took almost an hour to reach. that too to find out that packaging is loose and soggy just to save some cutlery. very disappointed"
"I had ordered jain bhaji, they delivered regular bhaji."

"Worst service ever . Please don’t go ever !!!
Kept me waiting for 1 pav bhaji order for 25mins !!! And my kid was crying even after requesting they didn’t give money or the food !

Restaurants should just not see business . Relations and humanity has to be given more importance"

Very hard panner can’t chew n stale panner n salad given along was with germs

The hyderabadi biryani was good to taste . But it was very spicy. The roti could have been more fresh . It seemed that roti was given after re heating.
