Review
"My friends and I were restaurant searching in the afternoon heat at Vasant Vihar and landed upon this place called Ayza.

The Place seemed small and we did have our second thoughts but then there was no other option around for Indian or mughlai. Reluctantly we ordered our food, one chicken biryani, some Chinese, rumali rotis and chicken kadhai. And to our surprise the food was mind blowing. The food was served well, the biryani was aromatic and tasted yum. Let's face it, not all the places serve good biryani, so I was sceptic about it but biryani here is just too good. The Chinese was also fantastic, I wish I hadn't eaten the biryani alone because then I would have some place...read more"
"A seriously pathetic messed-up place this is. 

Average / below average food, sub-pathetic service. Avoid, if no one is holding a gun to your head, or maybe even then"
"My man Friday for kebabs and other things Mughlai. Between the Kitchen and this, I prefer Ayza anyday. Although I've only eaten in the restaurant itself just once, the food is always supremely made. I'd recommend the Pahadi, Reshmi and Seekh kebabs, although the seekhs may be dry if you don't eat them quick enough.
In others, the Baida Rotis are hugely filling and delicious. The Rolls like the chicken and the egg rolls are all sumptuous. The gravies are standard, but I usually stick to Paneer variants as I don't like Chicken in gravy as much in comparison.
They're also open till 11.30-12, a boon for Thane where most things shut by 10-10.30. Keep it coming, Ayza!

"The best tandoor dish in the town and the chicken dum biriyani are just perfect...

Loved the butter chicken and butter naan..

Aloo bharwan is the ultimate veg starter..
Aloo is stuffed with fried smash potato n cut in slices its on a expensive side but seriously worth it...
Paneer makhmali roll other delicious starter for veg ppl around where thin slice of paneer rolled and roasted to perfection its a must try...

And I forgot to tell u guys the sulamani here is just amazing and the tawa chicken Bhuna Roll juicy n mouth watering..

Visit at Ayza is a must"

My mom wished to have rumali roti and i didnt like to go to a dhaba long way. So ordered one.Hard to find rumali roti nearby for home delivery.well they do it. Take some time for delivery so place an order in advance. Decently priced. Good menu for home delivery.
"Worst food ever!
Zomato, please include a zero in your ratings. This place has no idea what they are serving.
We went there and ordered Butter chicken as some reviews here had suggested. It was no 'butter' chicken. It tasted as if it was cooked in oil used for body massages, and that too 'used oil' rather. Another dish we had ordered was Mutton rogan josh, it tasted the same as the previous dish. Same disgusting gravy for everything. I had never eaten such food before. Our hands smelled like that oil for hours later. Pukey.
Save yourself from this one. Better reviews are misleading."
"Largely a take away joint but they do have decent sitting space and a huge menu. Was pleasantly surprised by their mutton dum biryani. Excellent subtle flavours, great portions and good quality mutton. It was so good, I've actually ordered and had it thrice in a week recently."
Pathetic Service ...... If you are eager to get food ordered at 7 pm delivered at 12 am ..... Please order here ...... Pathetic excuses over pathetic food ..... Sick .... Seriously
"Multi cuisine restaurant, nice tandoori items n kababs, chinese is good and so is punjabi.
Service quality needs improvement tough.
Home delivery is their USP. Within 30-45 mins the food is delivered."
"Have ordered twice from here, the rolls and chicken dishes are awesome. Its great for a weekend dinner takeout. The spring roll though were average."
"I have read a lot about chicken rolls this place offers. So decided to visit it.
I had a prawns manchurian roll which was tasty.
Next time i went for dinner with family.
We had chicken tandoor starters which were tasty . Best was butter chicken with rotis.
But biryani was very disappointing. It was very dry and seemed as if they have just mixed yellow steamed rice with chiken pieces!
They provide wide variety of starters like Tawa , Tandoor , Chinese. Must try rolls , starters and gravy dishes.
Prices are pocket friendly."
Had read abt this place on Zomato and then on decided ti give it a visit after office. Wanted to try the keema paratha...but what they served was a slightly warm pice of oily roti with keema sprinkled ..not even remotely a paratha...forget keema..and served after 15 mins...one wld expect hot and delicious smthng..and above tht must be thankful to the waiter ..he had missed the other item ordered... Saving us a double disaster...
"After reading the amazing reviews I ordered from Ayza since m new to Thane.
Wat can i say i returned one of the dish since my guests literally puked the mutton n brushed immediately n everything else tasted the same since the curry was same for no matter wat i ordered. I m never gonna order from this place ever again."
What an amazing surprise this restaurant gives you everytime you go. Everything on the menu card is well addressed. This place is my top favourite.
"Authentic food scores well above anything else and Ayza is one of them. For anyone who savours hard core non veg fare, get going to Ayza for you next meal outing. With bheja, gurda, paya and everything else on the menu it can easily make up for not travelling to south bombays Noorani, Saarvi or Olympia. We tried the Chicken kheema paratha, Egg baida roti and Chicken dum biryani and were forced to stop as our order was heavy enough else we would have to crawl back home. The biryani was very exceptionally good with the spices playing well with the senses. The roll and parathas were wholesome. We had to leave but with a promise of coming back soon to try out the kababs and gravies. The only...read more"
"We stay in the same neighborhood as Ayza, so we have tried out Ayza before. Our experience earlier with their so-called party pack was very good. 

So when I decided to have a party with a few of my friends, we decided that Chicken Biryani from Ayza was to be the main course for the evening. Although costing about 40% extra , at Rs 950 /kg, as compared to other biryani places in Thane/ Mumbai, we did not think twice before placing the order for 1 kg Chicken Dum Biryani, since our earlier experience of quality and quantity was very good. Over and above that we were told by the manager that 10-12 people could easily eat the same.

Imagine our surprise when we received the Biryani in a...read more"
One of the best in class non-veg menu...and best rumali roti's
My inability to carry my lunch at work is hopefully helping Zomato users...I try to have different type of food everytime i step out...Some of them r mind blowing but some of these shud b strictly avoided not in terms of taste or value for money but surely for hygiene n quality matters...I visited 'Ayza' recently but it turned into disaster...I ordered Mutton Biryani but I dn know what they brought in a biryani serving bowl...Rice was literally stinky n had a taste of Chinese fried rice...Meat pieces were all from cheap cuts n full of fats...For some reason even meat was stinking like hell n tasted like I'm chewing a leather belt soaked in brine for a week...Staff was least bothered n I...read more
"One of the best restaurants in Thane, especially when it comes to eating Non-Veg. Authentic, Delicious and Fresh. Service is extremely good and even the staff is friendly. Moderate on price.  Dont forget to try Butter Chicken, Chicken Rozali Kababs, Rolls and of course, sulemani chai )"
"The menu is wide, the cooking is good but the cleanliness and service are serious dampeners! Visited this place last Saturday with my husband and was pretty happy to see not much of a crowd! I was hungry and was secretly happy that we would be served quickly considering it was not that crowded! However I was wrong. We waited for 30-35 minutes before our order came! What was worse was the nagging houseflies! And to make things worse, the entire place smelt of raw non veg/fish. For me, who is a vegetarian, this was painful! I am a stickler for cleanliness and Ayza disappointed me."
"This is second time in the last week that we called for home delivery from AYZA.
AYZA is located in Hiranandani Meadows where earlier attempts to run restaurants in the same shop had failed.The menu is exhaustive with Rolls,Tava starters/Barbeque,Tandoori,indian,Chinese,Biryanias by the Kg etc.
Considering the variety of choices / dishes we opted for the safer options being home delivery. For starters we ordered Paneer Lasooni Tikka roll, Chicken tikka roll, Tandoori chiken and Chiken lollypop.For main course we ordered ""chicken lababdaar"" and ""Chicken kohlapuri"" with butter kulcha,butter naan and tandoori roti.

The rolls were fulsome and tasty.The stuffing...read more"
"7th June 2014

After reading all the reviews, we decided to go to Ayza. Our experience was horrible. The service was worst, although the staff was quite courteous. I think they are under-staffed and they focus more on home deliveries around Meadows.
The owner said that this was due to the weekend, which means that you should never go there on weekends
Food was ok. Place is quite specious and sitting is comfortable. Rates are slightly lesser, but of course in line with deliverables. You can not compare this with Royal Challenge, Satkar Residency n other good restaurants in Thane. So overall, this is ""an above average"" restaurant."
"Nice cozy place, with extremely polite staff.
Ordered tandoori non veg food for lunch was yummy...
Chicken tikka a must try here"
"When this place initially opened up, it was simply great. I used to order the rolls from this place all the time, sometimes even go there and eat. Soon, the prices went up and quality remained the same. Then one day, I called them to order for some food and ordered some basic Punjabi food. The bill was a bomb and the food was just okay. Never ordered from there after this. Stopped wanting to eat the rolls as well. Competitors like Faasos and even my local sandwich wala offer similar things at a cheaper price, better service and good quality.
Try out the Mushroom Tikka roll of this restaurant. It is very good."
Good non-veg food. Must try momos and biryani. Portions are sufficiently good. Ambience is ordinary. Decently priced.
"Ayza, Thane
My Zomato growth has been good as I continue to be upfront, if not, blunt in my reviews at the beck and call of my super sharp taste buds. I feel irritated if I do not visit or try out newer and new joints everyday. We have been good customers of AYZA, Thane since its commencement but I have been absent in my inculcation to it for some reason or the other. Last week I tried the Chicken Roll ( eggless) and was reasonably impressed with the taste, wholesomeness and cost. So when my favourite man won the PM nominated elections for the LOK Sabha I decided to throw an impromptu party courtesy IYZA.
So Euphorically I ordered 1 – Chicken Malai Roll at Rs.120/- and a Veg Tom Yum...read more"
"This used to be one of my favorite restaurant and I was a regular customer .... Especially for their lip smacking lasooni chicken... But recently, my favorite dishes had disappointed me couple of times..... If any one from hotel management is reading this review, please look into this.... Ambience and sit outs are very nice and comfortable..."
"Cant say enough about the quality and consistency of this place. Good honest food, great portions and the delivery is always within 30 minutes. The desi chinese is especially good and the Rajouli Kabab (chicken stuffed with minced chicken) is the best chicken kabab I have ever tasted. The rolls aren't bad either and everything is great value for money. I am a huge fan."
"Loved the prawns butter garlic roll, its a must-have for all prawns lovers. The ambiance can be done much much better though. Apart from that, they have a crazy list of items on the menu, so you have many options! I personally loved the rice items and rolls. One of the decent dining places around meadows."
Good food. Hope they continue the quality they have.
"I usually order chicken kadai or butter chicken and I love their rolls! Chilli chicken roll is recommened, if happeb to be strolling through hiranandani meadows in the eveing and don't mind spending 100-120 bucks for a nice chicken roll. This place is for u. Moreover their delivery is also good."
"Visited with my family and had a good time there, food was really great. Also loved the service,
Enjoyed both vegetarian as well as non- vegetarian found perfectly cook and lavishly represented.
warm atmosphere, wanted to visit often. By Mohit Pandey"
Ayza's a great place to order from! You must try one of the many rolls they offer!
"We had ordered the family party pack on dussehra day. The party pack consists of 1 kg chicken biryani + 12 pieces of kebabs + 10 rotis or nans + 2 non veg gravies + green salad + 2 bottles of soft drinks.
The delivery was done on time. And the food was piping hot when he delivered it.
We were 7 adults and 2 toddlers. The food was more than sufficient with enough leftover biryani for evening dinner too!!!
It was absolutely cost effective. The entire pack cost us only 1500.
The only grudge i had was that the kebabs were not boneless. Else it was a lovely meal which everyone enjoyed.
All in all it was a value for money. Will definitely order again!!!!"
"awesome food ...great service and good ambience.
the staff seems to be enjoying their service ..very cooperative staff.
all the paneer stuff is mi d blowing the typical north Indian style & the starter's are mouth watering ...
overall I love the food and wish to visit again."
tried it for the first time and just loved it....food was awesome and tasty. ..nice ambience. ..not too costly. ..service also good. ..go for it.
Food is something to die for in Ayza..... Ambience is good.... Service is great..... Rate is reasonable.... You would not be disappointed
