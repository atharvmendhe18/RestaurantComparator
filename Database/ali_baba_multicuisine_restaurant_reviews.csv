Review
"Murg mussalam a must try here. Big BBQ chicken cut in nice portions and tossed up with a thick red gravy (cashew and Red basic sauce) rich in taste and Good quality). Veg Kolhapuri for a veggie here. (QTY for 6 pple).
Pros: A/C, Good quality, and tasty
Cons: slow service but thats ok
Dated 25-02-21... Reviewied again... visited the place again for a lunch for 3.. pretty much disappointed with the pple and the food. Chicken lollypop was undercooked and smelly. Chicken handi was too oily and chicken quality was nt great. We have informed the owner abt the same and the only response i got is ""i will check"".. nevertheless we were charged for the unappetizing food.
Tip: the owner...read more"

Overpriced food not matching to the taste and quantity provided. Imagine paying 300 rupees chicken starters and getting sub-par quantity. Not worth the trip to this restaurant. Will not recommended dining here.

Best place best view best food at best price
"This restaurant is nearby to Vashi Railway Station. Visited here with my friends few days back, but the experience was not that good.

The food was too oily and also the taste was not that good. They do not have much options or variety for vegetarians. Infact, there are many other good restaurant at the same place nearby to this."

"Most pathetic food quality I had ever experienced. They provide rotten food which have dead insect.
When I shared the same to their restaurant manager he took the food including the insect then threw down the same and started acting as if it was accident and disappeared the evidence.
When I complained against about the same to the owner, he is hardly interested in the same. In fact he replied me to go ahead with complaint and doesn‚Äôt fear about the legal authorities for the same.
It is really embarrassing that restaurant don‚Äôt have any fear of Food authorities and about the health of customer."
"Opposite vashi railway station,
We were group of 10/12 people went here for lunch.
Its a multicusine restaurant,you can have chinese,north indian or south indian etc.
Starters and main course was good in quality and quantity,food tasted ok ok.
They must have to look for some hygeine.
The place isnt clean.
Order get to delay too receved,minimum they need atleast 30 miniutes for preparation.
Half of dishesh from menu its not available.
Overall ok."

"Been to this place twice and the food quality and taste was the same both the times.
Loved the flavours both the times.
There‚Äôs no ambiance but the place is worth a try."
Quantity is to less. Not worth it for money. It was my first order on zomato. Not happy with Quantity of food. Please a have look into to this.
"Late service, had to wait for the staff to attend us,even when there was no footfalls,got our order after 40 mins. Food was overall good had ordered chicken crispy which was nice. Triple schezwan rice gravy was not good. It was tasting better without it. If u can wait for ur food n waiter to serve then ali baba is right option."
"The place is located outside Vashi Railway stationüöÜVisited here with my team for LunchüòÖ. This place is for all the non vegetarian lovers.üê£
Not much variety in veg we gotüåø
The food was too oilyyüõ¢Ô∏è
Service is super slow.üò£ Seatings are comfortableüí∫
Food is extreme spicy which will spoil persons tummyü§í
We ordered Burnt garlic Fried riceüçõ, Hakka Noodlesüçú, Paneer sateyü•Æ, Paneer chilly dry, Daal fryüç≤ with Garlic naanüåÆ
Not worth as per the amount you payüí∏
Overall It is a onetime place to visit."
Happened to drop by this place when I was near Vashi station. I was in a hurry & since Ali Baba happened to be close by decided to have lunch here. This place is a small joint with open seating & a A/C section with few tables. We took a seat in the outside area & ordered for egg noodles & paneer chili. Both the dishes were not as good as we expected. The noodles was pretty dry & the vegetable in the noodles did not feel fresh. Paneer chili was taste less with no flavour of the soya coming through. Bill for both the items came to Rs.460 & it was not worth it at all. Skip this place if are planning to visit.
This place is awesome for Chinese Food lovers. Especially the Triple Schezwan From the Menu. Was on Zomato Gold so was able to visit this multiple times
"It's near Vashi Station.
They have AC seating..

Good place for Chinese fast-food..
Mostly occupied place as nearby corporate offices.

3/5 for food

"Visited the restaurant last week for team lunch during our office hours. We tried Burnt Chicken Schezwan rice, noodles, chicken Fried rice, paneer crispy which was really great to my taste, chicken handi and butter naan with garlic naan too. I would say all the dishes were really delectable in taste but their service was a bit delayed. I would recommend this place."

"Good visibility in terms of location and car park.food is good and so service ..a little slow I felt.but food was value for money
Less options in veg..for chicken lovers it's a mania.....they should keep waiters to improve service and prompt.
Will visit next time.."
No doubt they are no 1 restaurant in Mumbai .that's why I am giving them five star.i have many reasons for that first is their that everything is perfect here whether it is hygienic environment and good food quality with good quantity at reasonable price......must try their biryani thaaal and panner

Was Average Experience in Ali baba Multicuisine Restaurant.. Was been there with friends.. As I am Zomato Gold User I got Double Quantity of biryani.. That Quantity for 8 people i guess.. Ambience is average..
"The restaurant was good, It has an awesome ambience, Food was very tasty, So basically I am totally satisfied with the restaurant. The best part about the restaurant is thier services. I recommend you to visit the restaurant at least once. Ali Baba Multicuisine Restaurant"
"This is one of such restaurants which is a one stop for me if I am in Vashi, has bouquet of varieties in Chinese and Mughlai cuisine , its been almost 6 years that i am visiting this place and one thing common in the whole 6 years is Abdul bhai who serves us with utmost hospitality and friendly smile, I recommend this restaurant to everyone"
"Alibaba restaurant is near vashi railway station. There are 2 restaurants of Alibaba. Both are near but I think zomato gold is valid only on A/C restaurant.  The Service of Restaurant is very slow. We found quantity of food less as compared to cost, coming to the ambience, a lot of people crammed in. Very noisy place. Overall an average restaurant. So I have been here for couple of times because of it‚Äôs close to Vashi railway station. So we ordered there, chicken Patiala, chicken Mughlai, chicken tikka biryani, chicken 65, chicken chilly. Food Quality & quantity is average"
"The service here is too bad. Even after having Zomato gold offer they are not providing it.
The manager seems to avoid customer having any complaints."
"This place isn't worth going because they have limitations on their menu on behalf of zomato gold.
Staff has no manners to talk with customers worst restaurant ever visited."
"We were heading to navi mumbai and were in a quick appetite. So we started finding hotels near station and this is came up, also being a gold restaurant it was our top priority.

So we got down at vashi, it is near Vashi Station, there are boardings all over directing you to the place, its a AC restaurant don't confuse it with the one near temptation.

Coming to food we had ordered
‚ö´Chicken Lollipop
‚ö™Chicken fried rice
‚ö™Chicken noodles
‚ö™Chicken Biryani
‚ö™Veg fried rice

The lollipop was great, properly cooked and had a crunchy feel to it without compromising on the chicken, loved the dip they serve with it. It sufficient to fill 2.

Fried rice and noodles were way beyond our...read more"
"Tasteless food, slower service but while billing its very fast... just ordered paneer chilly cost 290/- sezhwan noodles 220/- Loot macha rahi hai??? Tasty food hota toh pay bhi khushi khushi kar dete but worst and bakwaas taste.Not deserve 1star as well. Wake up all dont go to this place."
"We visited this place for our anniversary dinner and it couldn‚Äôt have been any better. Be it starters to main course, everything was perfect.we got 3 complimentary desserts which completed the perfect dinner. Ali baba rocks.... üòçüòç"
