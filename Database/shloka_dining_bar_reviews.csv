"üìçShloka Dining & Bar Ghatkopar

"Shloka Dining Bar has a great selection of vegetarian dishes, including the Paneer Mussallam, which was absolutely delicious. The gravy was absolutely creamy and flavorful, and the paneer was cooked just right"
The butter kulcha at this restaurant was so good that I ordered a second serving! The Chicken Do Pyaaza & the Chicken Kheema was also a standout dish that had just the right amount of heat and a delicious depth of flavor
""
I can't get enough of the Chicken Tikka Biryani at this restaurant. The chicken and biryani masala were perfectly cooked and seasoned with a blend of spices that made it truly addictive. The service was also friendly and attentive
I've never tasted such delicious Chana Masala before. The chickpeas were perfectly cooked and coated in a rich tomato-based sauce that had just the right amount of heat. The decor of the restaurant also added to the overall experience
"Shloka Dining Bar has the best Chicken Achari Tikka Masala I've ever tasted. The gravy was silky smooth and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I also loved the paneer maskewala, which was rich and flavorful"
"I recently visited Shloka Dining Bar and I was blown away by the flavors! The chicken tikka masala was the perfect balance of spice and creaminess, and the Butter Kulcha & Garlic Naan was soft and delicious. I highly recommend this place!"
"If you're looking for authentic North-Indian cuisine, this is the place to go. The Mutton Rogan Josh was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the Chicken Hariyali Kebabs were delicious and tender. The service was also top-notch."

"This place throws such lively and refreshing vibes. I was here last Wednesday for dinner with my teammates. I must the the ambiance is top notch .
They had a live night the singer was soulful and entertaining.
The food was really good but the ande k nakhre and chicken shehenshah was super tempting üòç.
You gotta try these two for sure if you love North Indian food üòç"
Yummy üòã
