Review
"Wanted to go someplace with no loud music and crowd,hence decided on Astrix. Very close to station like 2 mins walk max.
We went on weekday evening and the place was empty,like we wanted.
Ambience wise the place is dark with black couches. Even the bar counter isn't lit much. Square area with full length glass windows on one side and 2 table sitting near them.
With a motive to just chill and relax... Didn't hog much like we usually do.
We had
1) Sweet Sonnet Mocktail orange drink with basil and lemon infusion with a bit of spice, this drink was really refreshing.
2) Back to school is spicy guava mocktail. Named so because in old school days children use to eat guava with salt and red...read more"
"We visited jewel of chembur at Astrix lounge on 07-Oct, it's nice place good service, ambience is ok... Overall it's good as per my rating is no 3. Good discounts. Dj is good, happy hours you will get good deal..."
"Been here long back it’s a small and cozy place and the dim lights just lets you have a good time with your loved one, a chilled out place in Astrix, must go"
"Location : Opposite to BMC (chembur station). Near Sadguru hotel

Ordered: 4 Cheese Pizza, Virgin mojito with white rum, MAC and cheese, Corn spiced starter, Mango ice tea cocktail.

Review : The pizza was a bliss. Just perfect and the taste of every flavor of cheese was evident at each bite. One of the best cheese pizza's ever had ❤️
Mojito and cocktail were also upto the mark ☺️
Mac and cheese served hot is just heaven ❤️

Other views : Well designed and perfect interior to match a sports club look. They have live screenings too. Grab your gang and this is the best place to chill. Loud music yes yes.

Food quality : 5/5
Service : 5/5
Ambience : 5/5"
"One of the best Pizza iv had in Mumbai. Ambience is excellent. Choice of music is class.

Id recommend Astrix for hangout, post a tiring day at work."
"Had been to this place thinking it would be a typical sports pub, however, the ambience and food was really great.
We tried the Mango cocktail and a virgin mojito which were both perfect. But the best part of the food was the cheese pizza...One word...simply YUM!
You actually get to taste the 5 different varieties of cheese that they include on this pizza. A definite must try!"
"Good food! Esp The Le Cafe Pizza!

Ambience is pretty fine. Good to hangout with a bunch of friends who are interested to watch sports.

Options for cocktails is limited! Happy hours are surely a delight! :)"
"So it's one of those places in chembur one can think of when they want a chilled out night. They have a projector and several other TVs where they have the games going on. The drinks here are good. However there is an excellent option, as you can order from the other Neighbour cafes.
The music here is good. However it's a Little to small of a place if you are looking to dance.
I had a fun time.
Thank you."
"So happend to visit this place on a weekday after work a decent place for ppl around In Chembur to hangout with friends and colleagues, with decent discount and offers on drinks and decent quality food trying out their chicken is a must try."
"Good place, ambience, plays decent music, donot
even try ordering cocktails, just ordered a Long Island ice tea and it's the worst I've had till date.
Dj is playing playing hard core trance on a Monday evening.Bad experience. Been here a couple of times and always left disappointed."
I am currently sitting in the lounge people Cannot even figure out the payment issue we have to miss our flight because of their network bullshit untrained staff hate hate hate
Located in Jewel of Chembur this is a cool place to hangout. The place is well made and has a nice bar. They share the kitchen with Le cafe. Food is good. Recommendations would be the Pizzas which are really well made and the Pastas. Starters are okay. Drinks are reasonably priced. The atmosphere at night is really cool. They play good music. Manager and staff are really courteous and helpful. Very close to the station also. Service is fast. Overall a pleasant experience. Kudos!
"Located right near chembur station, this place is a great one for a chill out. Good music, good food and drinks make this lounge an ideal place to be on weekends"
"As many people have pointed out before, nothing special about it, then why a 4 rating? Because :
1) There's a dearth of good bars in chembur, and this place fills in the void, if not perfectly.
2) It is a sister concern of Le Cafe, which serves one of the best continental food I have had in Mumbai. Sit in Astrix with good music and a whiskey and order the best food from next door.
3) Music : They have bose systems, and the music played is generally decent.
4) Alcohol : For a place this small, their liquor collection is commendable.

Basically, it's a place for chemburkars. I wouldn't visit it if I was staying in a different suburb."
"Nothing special.. U have many of these restobar available a stone throw away. Only advantage is its super near to chembur station that might suit helpful once u r drunk and cannot drive urself (#dont drink and drive)
Ambience - 3/5
Food - 3/5
Crowd - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Value for money - 3/5
Food was good. Not much of a variety inked on the menu card mostly starters. Booze was moderatelty costly however they have lots of offer on many brands.
Also they had a large screen for ipl matches which was well placed in between.
Overall its a GO."
"Located in Jewel of Chembur building, Astrix is a lounge which shares the kitchen with Le Café, known to serve scrumptious food. While the ambience is that of a lounge and cozy for a Chembur chill, the low seatings are uncomfortable to spend a long time in the place. The food menu is not extensive but just about fine to go with a couple of drinks. Given the cocktail blends, calling for regular drinks would be a better option here. We called for a long Island Tea which did not taste any different from a Lemon Ice Tea. Keeping the kitchen in mind, the pizzas are recommended!

Average place...u don't need to book a table even on weekends....food is not that great but ambience is good.....drinks are costlier as compared with other similar places....
This is an amazing place located in Chembur. We had gone there for a get-together and it was very good. The food was okay but the music and ambience was quite nice
located in jewel of chembur building and next to le cafe. nice ambience and typical bar/ pub look. seats are uncomfortable needs to be changed for the needs of patrons. service is good. menu is decently priced and had good food. also have an discount on citibank credit card on food ordered.
Had been wd my frnds during evening...Good non veg finger food..njoyed the music n d service.........a good place to chill aftr timbuctoo☺☺☺
"Nice place to hang out. Friendly staff, nice service. Good food. We had ordered some lamb and baby potatoes, both were delicious and was above my expectations. Value for money."
"Hanging out at this place was never thought of,but it turned out to be a good alternative.
Ambience was average.Menu needs more Addition for more choices.
Price was bit on the higher side."
"1 of the lounges in chembur. If you want to enjoy good music and drinks this is the place to be. The place is easy to find. Prices are reasonable and quantity is pretty good. Must try the chicken wings. Only drawback is that all tables are placed very close to eachother, so you can literally get disturbed/disturb the next table. In all I did have a good time and looking forward to visiting here again."
"Astrix is one of those few good places in Chembur where you can catch up with a bunch of friends over a couple of drinks, some finger food and good music. The seating however, is really low and gets uncomfortable after a point. The bar seems equipped with good domestic and international brands. They share a kitchen with the neighbouring Le Café, so the food is good, no doubt. Prices are fine, service is good and the place has a decent lounge ambiance."
"Astrix is situated in the hotel Jewel of Chembur. It looks quite attractive as you enter. A typical bar / pub ambience. I like the pink lights too. Although they could do better. Now the seats are too uncomfortable. They really need to modify or change their seating.

The best part is that alcohol is priced so low and plus they have happy hours. How blissful is that!? The starters are also priced apt. Which taste good too.

I would love to go here again and again!"
"Good food and service; small seating area, but well made. The music is deafening though. Repeated requests to turn down the volume make no difference, and you need to literally shout to talk to your companions. I don't understand the need for such loud music, especially when there's no dancing, and the crowd is down to a couple of tables only."
"I was so happy to see a lounge in Chembur, amongst all the udipi hotels. Astrix is situated in the busy station area of chembur east, in Jewel of chembur. Its a nice lounge, but i have never seen it packed. They screen football and cricket, they have a good menu, drinks are not pricey, but they screw up in one department - the music is crazy loud. They make good use of their Bose music system, and to talk to the person sitting next to you, you may have to scream. Even if the place is deserted, they won't turn down the volume inspite of requesting several times.
That is my only grouse. And oh, the place isn't kid friendly. If you're going with kids they will ask you to leave.
Good place...read more"
Place is good for family and business get together. Good ambience and good and prompt service. Moreover within budget. But frankly speaking foods especially starters are just ok for me.
It's an average place. You dont need to book a table as such.. Service is prompt. Food is okayish but Music is too loud. Good place for weekend chills!!
I don't need to book a table you 'll always get one ....their music is too awesome ...the staff members are good and you should try the pasta over there and food is generally good
"One evening my friend and I just decided to randomly visit this place. It wasnt crowded and has a good ambience to set the mood of a pub. Music was good and since there weren't a lot of people we even asked the DJ to play songs of our choice.
Ordered a vodka, a beer, some fries and another appetiser.
Enjoyed being there and will go back as it right in the heart of chembur and approachable, plus one of the very few places that actually give you the lounge kinda feel."
"Worst Friday night ever. Bad music. Happy hours only on Old monk and Royal stag. The waiter got the wrong order not just once but thrice. Chicken Wings were burnt and the skewers bland in taste. All in all the place was a disappointment. But I would still recommend the Le café pizza, the only thing I liked about the place.
Bon appétit!"
"What is new which I should write about Astrix?

It is a great place! It has a great sandwich! It has a great menu!

But it is at the wrong place!!!! It is deserted. It's bartenders are rusty. They have forgotten how to make a drink or even remember what the previous customer ordered even when the club is sparsely populated.

It has that really amazing ambience. That is it. No other reason for going to this place. You can place your music requests to the DJ. He will play but is lost in his own thoughts.... Enjoy!!"
"My hunt for awesome pubs in bombay continued this week as i came to Astrix in chembur. Being a weekday, it was sparsely crowded. The happy hours were on whiskey and wines. Pretty disappointing seeing beers excluded from happy hours. The service was friendly but a tad bit slower inspite of not being crowded. Seating is comfy and the ambience is perfect for a pub. They have music playing which is not loud and the song selection was good. We ordered a couple of chicken chilly and tandoor prawns and both the dishes were yummy.
I would definitely visit this place again if I am in the area. Rating it slightly less because of the exclusion of beer from happy hours and due to slower service."
"Nice sweet sexy place, if you are looking out for a small restro bar near chembur then this destination is worth it. All time music and lots of fun"
Very Gud Place to chill out with frnds....ambience is too cool offers will surprise u and food quality was also gud..... recommanded!!!
"Asterix is not a place you would go out of your way to visit, and we landed up there only coz we were in Chembur and hungry, and one of our friends recommended it.
The place was really crowded, with one table filled with kids having a competition on who can sound loudest. An elderly lady from the nearby table had to shout at them to shut up to maintain some sanity there.
But that apart, the food was surprisingly good. We ordered Hummus and it was the most differently tasting Hummus I've had. It came with a bread option that was crispy, and the combination was excellent.
So marks for the food, but terrible ambience, and only cut out for children and teens looking for alternate options to...read more"
"Astrix is placed in Chembur station, on first floor of Jewel of Chembur. This place is the only lounge/pub in Chembur. But it is still never full. This place is always half empty. They play excellent music and there are time when we have shaken a leg here too. The place is very relaxed (you can push your couch away and start dancing). The decor is simple. The couches are too big and take up a lot of space. They have a good array of drinks and are reasonably priced. They also do screening of matches.

The food is good. Love their chicken chilly. Best part is you can also order from Le Cafe which is just next door.

Overall a good place to chill and enjoy good music in Chembur."
Good spread of liquor but pathetic service.....Average taste.....Try once type but the DJ was too good....
Very bad place to visit. Waiters n chef think dey r vry smart tries to fool. Juz order one schezwan biryani was so pathetic n white riced wen asked dem to change dey were actin vry rude n manager was also not der.
Good drinks. Cost a bit high. But overall good enough. The starters are good though.
"This place tries hard to offer a club experience in the locality, guess its the only one around in Chembur.

A decent place, the drinks spread is good, service is fine, music is too loud, place is small but its fine as it generally doesn't get too crowded.

All in all a good place for a change, nothing to write home about."
"Very good place if ur are in group of 7-8 or more since its empty most of d time , thus enough place to party......ambience is gd n so is the food"
"Astrix was a surprise visit, it turned out to be rocking, I had checked in on final.match of t20 wc '14. What a ppl there cheering up really njoyed.
Beverages costs are not really expensive and gud staff I vll surely visit again and recommend to.others ya"
Been here many times with my friends. Ambience is really good. Service is also good. Must visit for those who drink.
"Completely chillax place
Great place to have a beer and watch the game or even catch up with friends and the weekend music is great to dance to
HIGHLY recommended"
Astix lounge is a superb place to chill with friends for sipping good cocktails and beer...staff is good
"Went there recently with some old friends to mainly drink and snack.

The ambience was pleasant enough and the place wasn't crowded on a weeknight.

They can turn down the volume of the rather dull music though and let people get on with their conversations without having to ask.

The snacks were well prepared and interesting. Will certainly visit again."
"First things first, Astrix offers a unique Bandra-esque pub/lounge experience in Chembur. Sadly, it does so only in terms of the ambience, the food there leaves a lot to be desired for.
We ordered the pepper garlic chicken and it turned out to like the pop corn chicken in KFC without the spices! In short, bland oily fried chicken with no traces of pepper or garlic.
We then went for some traditional stuff in potato wedges which turned out to be okay. The drinks were average with the mojito being okay okay.
The pepperoni pizza was good though.
All in all, if you are in a large group and do no want to travel to Bandra/Andheri, this place can be considered. Do not expect a lot in terms of...read more"
"Have been in love with the place since years. It's a safe haven, and is never too crowded. good food, great ambiance. My recent visit left me a little dissatisfied with the service. We ordered a chicken pizza in which we specifically asked them to skip te mushrooms. He repeated the order to us correctly but the pizza came with mushrooms. Also, their happy hours don't apply to beers which is sad. It's open till 12-12.30 so it's a nice place to hang out with friends on a weekday close to home."
Kinda regular out here with my friends and colleagues. A nice place with good music and ambiance in the chembur suburbs.. a great hangout during IPL matches.. Must try if you are in this part of town
"yes we celebrated happy father day with family
realy enjoy food & drink
dd"
Its a place where u can have fun with friends...ambience is really good...had been here for the UEFA Champions League finals....food was great and so was the service...!!!
The most chilled out place to be in chembur.... Serves good spread of drinks and food.... Good music..... Comfortable seating and most of all wonderful staff......
"If u want all 3 choice of restaurants, i.e pub, family fine dine, cafe... the this place give you all of them.. their happy hours is a good opportunity for drinkers..."
"old english style pub , good music amazing italian food , worth some time"
This is the place to drink in Chembur! The drinks are fantastic and so are the snacks and starters. The crowd that comes here is also good and on a Saturday night it is exhilarating. This is clearly the best lounge I have been to in Chembur! I would give it a 10 on 10 anyway!
This place is just so awesome! I love coming here for a few drinks with my girls. The food is pretty good as well. Love it. Gotta try this place! XOXO
My friend got me here a few days back. We had a great time. Had a lot to drink and the bill didn't hurt much. Totally loved this place. I am coming back here soon!
"I was pleasantly surprised to see this place in Chembur. Its located in a very crowded place but once you enter, its bliss. Not much of crowd. Fair prices. Good service. Nice DJ and music. Overall a good escape joint for loners and couples who want to hangout in Chembur."
"Went to this lounge bar on a Saturday night, expecting that it'll be crowded. However, was pretty much amazed to find the place virtually unoccupied. Phew!!! What to do?
Realized that all the crowd is in South Mumbai, so... Nevertheless, got myself a place to sit and gradually found out that the place is actually not so bad, which is to be ignored. There was a live DJ, decent music selection, and last but not the least, DRINKS are cheap :)
Overall, a fine place to hang-out..."
