One of the best Chinese spots in Powai
very cold food

It was too oily
wrong order

"the noodles were over cooked and sticky.
also it was the most average pad thai i have ever had.
not worth it!"
Great Taste
Didn‚Äôt like the taste
"Food packaging is not up to the mark, one box spilled out completely. very poor packaging."
The taste of fried rice with veg Manchurian was great. The only suggestion is to put less oil in the Manchurian as it was dripping from the side of the box.
""
Very bad quality
pot rice had a foul smell as if something was spoiled
need to improve the taste
This time the order was very salty. Seems they changed the chef
ok
Worst experience of Chinese cuisine
Delivery was before time and food was nicely packed but taste was average

Everything about this place is bad. They lack the basics of a restaurant. I wish this just closes down tomorrow so that many people can be saved by the horrible and utterly disgusting experience this outlet gives.
"The staff is absolutely pathetic and with it comes with no surprises at all the pathetic hygiene of the place. If you are looking ahead to have health issues please go ahead and order from this place. This place wont disappoint you in that case, but for everything else, this place is a utter disappointment and in my opinion can be completely avoided."
Taste was good n less spicy as we prefer
very good and very delicious

The taste was good but could have been better as it was a bit spicy and veggies were less.
