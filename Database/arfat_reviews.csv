Review
One of mine favourite place you can say to visit and have my dinner with my closed one‚Äôs i visit this place too many times All their menu are worth not at all expensive and good quality chicken used loved it
"So I have recently tried Butter chicken and Garlic naan from this restaurant.
The taste was awesome of both the dishes and also delicious.
Great quality and quantity also great tamper proof packaging.
Highly recommended outlet."
It was good experience. The satff was also good. Just need to get more variety of fish.all over very good experience.
We ordered for the Tandoori chicken and Chicken man chow soup 1 by 2 . Both the things were really tasty and yummy. The chicken tandoori was well marinated and grilled to perfection properly and cut into small pieces which made it easier to share. The manchow soup was good too. Tried the chicken schezwan tandoori it was spicy and tasty. Charred grilled to perfection
"Chicken is smelling bad in chicken fried rice and noodles .chicken patiyal is complete sweet and tasteless.only paneer crispy is good but the quantity is very less ,as I paid for full and they send me like half quantity.very bad experience at this restaurant.I will Never order from this restaurant from next time onwards.Waste of money ."
Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and they do different deals on different nights so it‚Äôs worth checking them out before you book. Highly recommended.
If you want to eat recycled food from previous day this is the right place. Seriously these guys should have some honesty in them.

I ordered chicken biryani and I liked it as it was properly cooked and chicken pieces where of good quality and the quantity they provided was enough for me.
Most pocket friendly place in mira road with food better than all those restaurants having 300-400 rupees per dish. Delivery is very fast literally fast
"Went late night like 15-20 minutes before shut down,were closing up, then to they served us which I liked it.
Ordered patiyala with naan which commonly people here go for... Tasted pretty good enough
Had much expectations from their biriyani but honestly wasn't that great...
But yes they provided us with decent hospitality and prompt service that to at late night...."
Arfat is amazing place for having maincourse..even starters is also amazing i have tried chicken crispy which was mouth watering...so you should try this place at once...!!
"Been there a couple of times and my favourite from there is Butter chicken and Chicken masala. Both the dishes are delicious and taste different from what we eat regularly at restaurants. Small place and not privacy for talking, fast moving and average service."

"Worst tandoori I've ever had in my life, Didn't even felt that I'm eating chicken, Dhoka hai!"
Worst tandoori ever had in my life fooling guests with the size of the chicken as if the chicken is malnutritioned

"We ordered Chicken Murg Musullum & Tandoori Butter Roti . The masala was little spicy by adding little teaspoon of lemon juice & the gravy was thick . Chicken was soft . Services are quite good & the staffs were friendly . One thing I've observed is that they had many waiters & that's why the delivery of food is fast , so we enjoyed hot food & they served it in a good manner . Ambience is also nice & affordable prices . Will visit again ."
"Arfat is one of my go to place for Mughlai food. Tandoori chicken was so tender and smokey. 
Butter chicken was good but not great. I was happy and satisfied."

I would recommend each and everyone to try their heavenly Butter Chicken ü§§üòç I get drools in my sleep dreaming of it üòç It's so damn affordable and the staff is Uber polite ‚ù§Ô∏è A must visit for a foodie.
"Viaited the place with my colleague Jinesh Patel. We wanted to try something spicy and ended up ordering chicken balti from the variety of food on the menu. Awesome taste, nice food"
"Well, I heard about this place and me n my friends decided to stop there for lunch. Since it was new to me I made sure that I learn more about that place through Zomato , found good reviews and we went for lunch. We ordered 2 starters and we ordered the chicken murg musullum . We didn't like the crispy chicken but we had hopes from the murg musullum. When it came and as it was being served we found it a bit suspicious and to our surprise we found a cockroach in it . We really didn't expect this . We are really very upset with this ."
"I celebrate my birthday in arfat hotel. My friend suggest me this hotel and I thank to my friend to suggest me arfat hotel. If you are chicken lover this hotel is for you. It's very hygiene , good staff , service good and price is very less than other hotel and best in taste. If you are chicken lover you please come and visit this hotel"
"The ambience is good with A/c & Non A/c.The service was also good by them. The quality of food was also excellent with proper quantity. We had chicken Kolhapuri, Murg Mussallam with butter naan..it was just amazing.! Special place for Chicken lovers‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Awesome place for Non-veg lovers.. Great clean ambience..Awesome service from staff..

In the arfat restaurant the food is awesome and testy food and hygienic food to eat with beautiful ambience you can go with and family must visit.
"The best place in Mira Road you can dine in.
The quality of food is nice and along with it the taste is superb. If anyone is thinking of budgeted dinner you can visit here.
The chinese starters are superb in this place."
"The best thing about this restaurant is that it is pocket friendly and taste is just superb. I would recommend you guys to check this place out. They have good tandoor items, Biryani and the butter chicken is to die for. This place is located near railway station so it is quite famous here."
"This is the baap of all restaurants
When it comes to biryani and Mughalai food
Veg biryani if you have not eaten this then i think your missing the best biryani.
Veg paneer balti another terrific dish
Chinese i would say plz dont eat they have speciality in biryani.
This place is also a heaven for chicken lovers"
Great place of you are a non veg lover than this is your place chicken tastes extremely good and chicken rice mouth watering the staff is polite place is hygienic food is awesome a perfect heaven on earth pocket friendly veg food also tastes good specially chinese thats it
Worst place to order from order took more than 1.5 hours was not told about it during taking order food was cold the restaurant use to good but know it's really bad
Very bed service they denied my order it was my fst and worst experience with zomato. I am going to uninstall this useless app plzz don't use this app
"A must visit place if you are a non veg lover. The only sad part is that if you call them sometimes their phone will be busy like 9/10 times but that is solely due to their popularity. The variety of dishes they offer are endless. Some of the must try dishes are chicken handi, chicken afghani, butter chicken. They offer great service and the best part is that their dishes are not at all over priced. They justify the price. The chicken tikka biryani is also a great pick just incase you feel like eating some biryani.
Service : 5/5
Staff: 4.5/5
Taste: 5/5
Value for money : 5/5"
