"Biggest Disappointment - Went here for lunch two days back with a hungry stomach and dreaming about Arselan biriyani ( Same standard as Kolkata Arselan ) FYI 3 weeks back I was in Kolkata & had a mind blowing Chicken Spl Biriyani . Arselan Biriyani in Kolkata is doing more business than Amenia ( one of the finest Biriyani restaurant in Kolkata ) With similar kind of expectation I've ordered the same chicken spl. biriyani but sad to say I was quite disappointed! with biriyani its not even have any qualities of Arselan biriyani tasteless, chicken pieces are overcooked & Potato was tooo overcooked & seems like just taken it out from chicken gravy & sad part for that Biriyani I've paid...read more"
"Very good mughlai cuisine.
Best to have here is Chicken Arsalan.
If staff are more professional it can be better."
I have in arsalan kolkata its the best restaurant famous for its biryani n kababs i would like to try arsalan mumbai too after than only i can increase my ratings towards it.
"After seeing the reviews of this I thought why not give it a try as their biryani was supposed to be really good. So I had placed an order for their specialty the Lucknowi chicken biryani for my house party.. Turns out that the biryani was stale and stinking by the end of the night..not many guests took a plunge in it as they got a whiff of it..
I saw too many wasted plates of the same...

Early morning had to wake up to the stale stink of the biryani and throw all of it... Guests din enjoy it at all. such a big turn off.

Well so I called today morning to complain to their management about how their famous biryani was stinking ... they wouldn't listen nor just admit to the fact that...read more"
Just awsum food. Nothing else to say. Plz visit this place nd u will just love it.
"Just visit this place. Take my word and you will keep coming back.

Let the exterior looks dont bother you. At first i thought the SBI branch above it was getting all decked up but eventually when Arsalan opened i found that this is the mumbai outpost of the famous Arsalan from Calcutta. I'm very hesitant about bengali food for some weird reason but when i tried this place for the first time, i realized there is no bengali connection !! rejoice :)

Everything on the menu is worth a shot and it doesnt disappoint you at all. Some dishes are too delicious and give you that guilty pleasures which you wont mind. Make sure you hit the threadmill the next morning - after it's mughlai food !!

"Went to arsalan for a quick bite in afternoon, as I had heard a lot about its chicken roll, I thought if trying one. I should say that I was really disappointed with the roll as it was sweet full of ketchup and a normal tasting chicken. We then tried mutton kakori kabeb, chicken kassa, veg roll, paneer roll & veg biryani. The kakori kabeb were gud with a smooth texture to it, but the rest of the stuff was not commendable. Chicken kassa had lots of floating oil into it, so it spoilt all the fun but tastewise it wad just ok. The veg roll was supposingly better than the paneer roll, paneer roll was also very sweet. The veg biryani looked like veg pulao but it tasted gud. Last but not the...read more"
"We decided to order through Arsalan based on some glowing reviews from friends and an almost cult following of their biryani. We ordered in a mutton special dum biryani, chicken Kasa and some breads to go along with it.

The mutton in the biryani was divine, two large pieces tender and juicy beyond belief. The rice was subtly spiced with saffron and ghee, but flavorful enough to keep us refilling. I would have thought they would provide raitha and salan, but we only got some onions and pickle. The chicken Kasa was rich and doused in oil, but tasty. A lone piece of chicken with about 100 ml of thick gravy.

Overall, I found the food heavy but very tasty. I guess I could stomach this kind...read more"
"I had been to this place a few times for kebab rolls. But that was about it, till the time I went to kolkata and realised how big a brand this was. So after coming back I decided to give it a try for a complete meal.

I ordered for MuttonRezala, mutton chaamp, mutton pasanda. I did like all of them. The food is on oily side. But as kunal vijaykar says 'oil is the carrier of taste'. You should ignore the oil and dig in. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I have also tried the gurda kaleji, mutton kassa, bheja. The bheja is decent but rest of the dishes are really good.

Talking about the biryani it has just one big piece of meat with a nice big chunk of potato and a boiled egg....read more"
"I had heard about the fame of this restaurant when I was in Kolkata recently - hence decided to checkout their Mumbai outlet for lunch with family last Sunday afternoon. As expected, it was a gr8 culinary experience. We tried 2 types of chicken kababs - hariyali and achari - both were good - chicken pieces were soft and succulent with right mix of spices. This was followed by their speciality dish - mutton biryani which had aromatic long grained rice with 2 perfectly cooked meat pieces, one potato and one egg. It was yummy. We ended with phirni - it was creamy and not so sweet.
Cost was moderate - it was a nice experience."
"So we were shooting this music video once and there were about 25/30 of us, so we decide to call in from Arsalan!

These guys are good. The took the order right, delivered it in the time they promised (3 hours) and i think they gave us a little discount.

So i am a MASSIVE Mutton Barra fan (Thank you for that Delhi) and i was elated to find that Arsalan serves barra, as much as its not a shade on the real Delhi deal, it is quite nice. Love their ""saalan"" too (Thats gravy) The risala/korma, all quite nice. The mutton biryani is also something i like from Arsalan, plain and simple, more of a pulao than the greasy Bombay Biryani we get.

And they are consistent, that a big tick...read more"
"I am from Kolkata, so I am aware of the fame of Arsalan. I have visited their Kolkata outlets few times. Now being at pune and deprived from good biryani, it was a welcoming moment when my friends suggested to visit this place, while I was in Mumbai.

The place is near to Khar railway station. Ambiance is really nice, though not much seats to accommodate. We ordered chicken dum biryani and mutton chaamp. That Kolkata style biryani which roots from Lucknow style, easy on tongue, taste in every morsel, a beautiful combination of mild fragrance and proper masalas, not heavy on either side. Chaamp was heavenly. Firni is also very good. And all of this do come in moderate price. I will...read more"
"Being a hotel management graduate from the best institute in the country, I tend to be judgmental on various parameters and also act as a critic.
So, here goes my review for Arsalan. I have been here to this busy place a couple of times and decided to write about it now.

Food:

Food is good. Yes, Good. Not excellent. The price range it falls in is not too expensive too, so a bit downgraded biryani is justified by Arsalan. If you are a vegetarian, about which I really feel sorry by the way, food for you is just like any other restaurant. Kindly do not expect too great food item in Veg. Menu section. It's decent.

If you are a meat lover, do try out their Mutton Stew. Oily, but that...read more"
"For someone who has frequented Arsalan in Calcutta for almost a decade and more, Arsalan in Mumbai is PATHETIC. It has been two times now, when the service and turnover was VERY slow and bad.
Add to that, for a biryani to take 25 minutes to be given at the table, you must but wonder what is the restaurant up to.
Less quantity, stale phirni and below their own standards with taste, all forgiven because I so enjoy biryani, does not mean such service can be meted out.

It is very disheartening to see a Calcutta brand name being made a joke of in this city where a biryani is priced double its original, but service and standard being so appalling, I worry for them!

Please get better."
"Good food. Especially Arsalan Chicken Kebab a must try...
Only negative point is the disposal of used plates in the eating place, which makes a lot of noise..."
This was my 3rd visit to arslan. I had better experience on last couple of occasions. This time when I visited I saw that most of the staff is changed. We order tangdi kabab and it was ok. The terrible experience started afterwards. We order mutton kassa and roti. They served in 10 minutes and it was cold. I was shocked and complained to the manager. He said he will see to it. They served another dish in 5 minutes. It was hot. After few minutes when saw in the kitchen and observed that the most they putting all the dishes in microwave and serving it hot. Now I realised that how come I receive the hot dish in 5 minutes. Next horror was to find 2 hair in the dish. That really pissed us off...read more
"We had eaten from arsalan in calcutta and just love the food. So we decided to call for it at home. But i was so disappointed and angry at the service. Its just pathetic. We waited for 2 hours for our food to be delivered to khar, which is just ten minutes away. We were told it would take half an hour and when we called after one hour, they told us the guys are not there. And even then they didnt send our food immediately.
We realized later that people have had similar experiences. They might have good food but their service sucks."
"I have had mixed feelings for this place, which range from understanding the undying love of the Bengali fraternity for this restaurant to savoring their good food at nominal prices.

Arsalan was down the road from where I used to live, so I used to be over there for at least a couple of meals every month and maybe a take out or two as well. It is the offshoot of a Kolkata based caterer, and their first branch in Mumbai which opened about 2 years back. The trick with eating at Arsalan is to not expect North Indian school of Mughlai cooking, but the Calcutta school, which is different in many aspects and could surprise you the first time. The place is swarming with people during the...read more"
"I like my Biryani dry and without gravy unlike the ones they make in Mumbai. I prefer calling the Mumbai Biryani yet another rendition of the Masala Bath! Kolkata Biryani fits the dry Biryani bill. Arsalan's other Biryanis are also cooked in the dry format although I doubt whether that is the way to cook it.

I would strongly recommend that you try their Biryani (the Dum Pukht one) along with the added egg and potato. Apart from their Biryani, the phirni and shahi tukda are also yummy. I also love their rolls since it is cooked in the Bong style with a pinch of sugar in the maida. Their Kebabs are tasty but nothing to boast of.

Note: I would prefer sticking to the Biryani and desserts here."
"The food is decent and the ambience is ok. Nothing extraordinary to write about. The food has good flavors but misses the mark when compared to its Kolkata namesake. The service is good and the staff is courteous. Apart from their famous biryanis, have tried their fish masala tikka which was, interestingly, quite good and surprised us."
"Love the biryani, especially the mutton biryani. Also the chaap is very good and both taken together is heaven."
Never have their rolls. The kitchen is bloody unclean. Be sure to visit your GP after eating here. Disgusting.
"1) Biriyani & Chap ---- Amazing :)
2) Try out Chicken chatpata & Firni :)
3) Ambience -- Strictly okay, a bit loud infact
4) Service -- pretty good :)

If you love Kolkata Biriyani, you can't just miss this !! Hell with calories .... I love it !! :) :)"
"if u r from kolkata & missing kolkata's rolls, thn pls visit this corner plot at khar... one word to summarize my experience 'awsome'"
"Excellent food....
Had ordered mix chicken platter for starters, and it was amazing!
Then for the main course, it was mutton special biryani, chicken special biryani and a mutton gravy.. All three were just too good.
To my surprise, the mutton pieces in the biryani were extremely soft and full of meat.. Was lovely!!
I would recommend this retro to all, as the quality of food is amazing, and also the quantity."
"Most of the Mumbai restaurants don't know how to make biriyani. They make some Masala stuffs and call them biriyani . Arsalan is the place where you can have the best Awadhi biriyani in city. Simply the best Mughlai food joint in Mumbai. Arsalan special kabab, Dum Biriyani, Rezala,(and many more) are my favourites. Restaurant situated in an easily identifiable location will not cost you much. It's not super expensive, and crowd is always good. Although the location is at a busy crossing, you will get the Valet parking facility."
"I've stayed in Kolkata for 6 months and with everyone in my family being a foodie I've practically raided every restaurant on Park Street and Arsalan has a huge reputation there for mughlai and north indian food. Its cheap, the food is very rich but if you're a foodie who cares and its mouth watering. Every dish that comes out of the kitchen is a dish to remember

That I was talking about Kolkatta. Coming to Mumbai there's only Arsalan I've been to and this one is in Khar near state bank. Its right on the side of the road so very easy to locate with their huge flashy sign and lights.

Best time to go to the restaurant is during lunch time if you don't want to wait but otherwise its...read more"
"I am from Calcutta, and a huge fan of Arsalan, have been eating there since childhood in Calcutta. I love their Biriyani, Tangdi kabab's, Chicken Chaap, Mutton Kasa, Firni etc. Somehow, I don't like how the food in Bombay Arsalan tastes like, it's not the same. I used to be a regular in Bombay Arsalan, somehow I have seen the quality and taste going down day by day. I went their yesterday to try my luck and I was hopeful about them improving, but I was disappointed once again. I found the biriyani and kakori kabab full of Garam Masala, that too in excess. Rumali roti and Mutton Kasa was decent enough.

"On a rainy Sunday afternoon me and my mom picked Arsalan for lunch. The crowd is less in the afternoon. Arsalan is open till 1 a.m so you can imagine, customers must be popping in late night for take away and dining.

Got the table inside, full AC. But like I said, very few people in the afternoon.

We started with..

Arsalan Kabab - A blend of cheese and egg wrapped on huge chicken pieces. Really awesome.

Followed by...
A full portion of Butter Chicken - Of course fatte oily and damn tasty :)
An Chicken Arsalan Biryani - The essence of the spices was strong. Big tangdi inside with dum style aloo
Settled for a Garlic Naan and Tandoor Roti.
Of course the Mutton Chaaps were awesome....read more"
"I had never been here, mostly due to the location and crowd.

Landed up with friends. It was empty at 8.30 pm on a Saturday. The trouble began with the order - server had no clue of what was available, made some scribbling notations till we raised out voice and another took his place.

In the meantime we were informed that Chicken chaap was not available - ridiculous for a restaurant which prizes itself on the dish, that too on a Saturday evening.

We ordered mutton bara kabab - succulent and very good, mutton chaap - nice, though I would have preferred the mutton a bit well done. Some one from the group had ordered Chicken butter masala - sweet with no taste at all; rogan josh -...read more"

"The nearest it could be to Kolkata Moglai Cuisine... My daughter would like to go there every weekend.. even her father wish the same.. only if he was not little worried about something called cholesterol. Still it calls for regular visit of all Kolkatans.. you get everything in Mumbai, not this Biriyani, unless you are in Kolkata or in Arsalan Khar. SUUperBB."
"I am a big fan of Arsalan , ,kolkata. Today i went for lunch with my friends at khar.
The experience in terms of food & services is horrible. I am surprised how they can play with their own brand name. They must send their staff to kolkata for training."
"Must against my wishes, I was being asked to accompany for lunch to Arsalan. I had a bad experience here some months back hence the reluctance. The ""BONG"" influence was again at play; this time it was my ex-Boss who happens to be a Bengali.

We reached there by around 1.30 pm and the place was crowded. Every person in the restaurant was busy digging into some meat or the other and relishing it as well. We waited for 15-20 minutes for a table for 6 persons.

Table was arranged for, we were ready to order. This time I was not going to risk ordering the regular Roti-Sabji fare that I tried last time and was utterly disappointed.

"only if u r a pure true lover of REAL mughlai non-veg then its a must place.rather i shud say absolute best in mumbai & thane jurisdiction. no one can compare the non-veg taste with arsalaan.
if u r a veg then u r a big stupid.
if u r expecting a magic then again u r a stupid.one cant expect awesome non-veg delicacies at reasonable price.
if u r expecting fine dinning expecrience at this price then u r a biggest stupid."
"The only thing that strikes my mind when I hear Arsalan is their delicious Biryani!! The best biryani I have had in Mumbai. Being a foodie have tried almost all their varieties. This place is good for non vegetarians. Musy try are the mutton chaamp, chicken arsalan kabab and mutton dum biryani. The only disappointing thing about Arsalan is that the staffs are confused souls. There is a chance that they might get you a regular biryani even after bein told to get special biryani. This has happened to me for couple of times. Rest its a great place to relish moghlai food with friends and family."
One Of The Best Mughlai Food i hav had in recent times....tht 2 reasonable in terms of money....tried their chicken tandoori which was cooked to perfection...as per the waiter's recommendation we tried the chicken chatpata which was perfect in taste...neither tangy nor sweet...had the chicken chatpata wit the garlic naan which was so yummy...i actually ate one garlic naan raw....i.e witout gravy....wanted to try their biryani but was so full tht may b i hav to visit again to try some more dishes.....the only thng which i didnt liked it was non availability of mocktails which were there on the menu...wantd to hav virgin pinacolada but it was not available...so had to order sweet lime soda...read more
"The only thing that comes to my mind when I hear the name Arsalan is their absolutely delicious mutton biryani. This place serves the best mutton biryani in Bombay.

Apart from the mutton biryani, the rolls there are pretty good and reminds you of rolls that are typically from Calcutta. This place is a must visit for all people who miss Calcutta mughlai food!"
"good food at decent prices & a 'must visit' place for biryani aficionados. mutton kassa can be passable at times & so is their chicken champ! but overall, one of the finest mughlai restaurants in bombay"
Very good place to eat. Fantastic food . Very relaxing place. Good.
"Hey guys ,
-If you're a vegetarian cancel your bookings.
-Non vegetarian food was good enough.
-Acceptable ambience with Mosquitos all over .
-the staff doesn't have serving ethics.
-the staff is unaware of what they serve !!
-bad setup !!!"
"Came here one night, after being out at the bars for awhile. The place is quite large and shiny...one can't miss it when driving down SV Road.

We sat ourselves outside and ordered the usual: mutton chaps, biryani, chicken tikka masala. And some version of kosha mangsho, which wasn't on the menu.

The food was undoubtedly very tasty, it it sits in your stomach like a stone and you will have to cancel any plans for the rest of the night....believe me, I couldn't eat anything for a day afterwards.

Its also a tad on the oil side. So come and eat here but definitely exercise some moderation.

Also, they don't serve alcohol, and you can't BYOB.....so be mindful of that."
"Want to have authentic Lucknowi biryani??
Yes this is the place for you. I have been their a couple of times and found Arsalaan amazing every single time. I have also been to the Arsalaan in Kolkata, and across branches Arsalaan is one of the best place in the country for biryani. Being a big biryani lover, I have tried biryani from some of the best resturants; Arsalaan is one among the most loved places for biryani. Apart from this mutton barra kebab is also a must have."
"Mind-blowing! Best Biriyani in town. After relocating to Mumbai I tried several biriyani joints but none of them are even near the kind of biriyani that Arsalan offers. You can also try Arsalan Special chicken kababs which is quite good.

Its a must have biriyani in Mumbai."
being a regular customer the food quality has degraded in the last couple of months food is very oily tasteless dishes mentioned in the menu are not as same delivered so kindly cheack before ordering (thumbsdown)
"Dirty Ambiance, Mosquitoes, Smelly Plates, No green chutney with kebabs, Warm Coke And bland Biryani. Won't recommend."
"Dirty Place with mosquitos, Smelly Plates, no green chutney with kebabs, no mocktails and bland biryanis. Not Recommended!!"
We didn't wait for the food to arrive. The plates smelled of wet used rags and dead meat. The plates and cutlery looked like petri dishes for bubonic plague. Couldn't afford to get sick so walked away without the meal and with little regret from the staff.
"Last day of the year's lunch, ""special"" must say.. served a plate of mutton biryani with a COCKROACH in it..indeed great!!And the reactions from the staff even more brilliant!! Staff surrounding the table as if we were a group of mutants..."
"Absolutely horrible !! Highly questionable hygiene standards , placed our order and were told after 20 mins that the dishes are not available .... Walked off in disgust and then had to wait 20 mins to locate the poor lone valet to bring our car !"
"The Chicken Biryani - Bad, Expensive and not worth it!
An extra piece of potato would set you back 10 Rupees, I could buy a Kilo of 'em with the same 10 Rupee note!
Utterly Disappointed!
Frankly, I'd rather go to a place like Lucky and Metro (Andheri east) which is so much better and decently priced.
Arsalan in a simple word ..... horrible!"
"Nothing tastes heavenly to a Bengali than a biriyani with a nice big potato thrown in or even an egg. So Arsalan thrives on the"" make a Bengali feel good with nostalgia factor."" To be honest much better biriyani places exist in Kolkata. But Arsalan has maybe a mini first mover advantage. While comparing it with the other Cal biriyani joint Hangla's it scores better.
The chaap and rezzala tastes good .The Kebabs, not essentially a staple Kolkata Muslim food regular, do a fine job in adding to the menu and catering to the palette and tastes buds here.

Good moghlai food at affordable price but service & hygenie a major concern. Arsalan Biriyani & Mutton Chhamp is very good. They also provide valet service which is very nice value & essential if you want to dine in peace with you car being taken care of.
"Arsalan was once a fine place with great food.One thing that still stands out is the Dal Makhani.The best I have had in Mumbai.Veg Biryani is surprisingly better than chicken Biryani!Sadly,the resteraunt is deteriorating in its food quality and becoming more unpredictable by the day.They seem to be changing their chefs quite often as the quality of food varies drastically!Still,the problem is that when it is at its best,it is mind blowing!so,if you have had great luck in the past,give it a visit.All the best!and i suggest the following:

Dal Makhani,chicken biryani,veg Biryani,butter chicken,panner Makhani"
"I visit this place quite often. even twice in a week. Like the ambiance. Even liked the one in Kolkata park street. I am a faithful disciple of Mutton Rezala. Nothing to say about biriyani of which it is so famous. Apart from this two, Rashmi butter masala and Arsalan special kabab feels like heaven. But do not ever try Hyderabadi biriyani here. Its a crap. I specially bank on Biriyani. Service is good. Last but not the least You can very well try the rolls here and I can tell you its the best in Mumbai. The taste of Lachha Parantha with the mutton melts in your mouth and gives you a feeling which you will never forget. Sweet dishes are ordinary."
"We took a parcel from Arsalan in Khar yesterday evening. Ordered mutton stew, chicken stew, chicken chaamp, rogan josh and mutton dum biryani. The mutton stew and the biryani were the pick of these dishes. The biryani is particular was fabulous, fairly dry and not oily - just the way i like it. Wish the other dishes were as less oily as the biryani though. All the other mains literally had oil floating on top. Overall delicious food but they really need to cut down on the oil."
"Arsalan is very good when it comes to food(non veg) and price but the ambience and service is not that great ...... If you are one of those who like a proper set up and good service and good crowd n all then its not for you . ( take Aways can b a option for you as food is lip smacking )

For those who just care about tasty non veg food , this Is a place you must surely visit"
"Rating it average for the following reasons (visited very recently):

Drinks were brought intermittently, the waiter spilled food on us while serving thrice - it almost became comic!

-ve: Portions are VERY SMALL ! It would hardly suffice one person (we ordered non-veg mughlai dishes and chicken starters only)

"So I am from Kolkata and no I am not a bong. Having clarified that I wanna tell you one more thing I'm a vegetarian. So my review is only for the benefit for for all those people who tag along with friends craving for mutton or chicken at Arsalan. The veg biryani SUCKS! No veg starters apart from paneer tikka and that too sucked. So spare the biryani and try the curries and the gravies, they might just give you the satisfaction your looking for!"
"On 11 Oct i went with my offcie team of 11. This was my 2nd visit to the place. The waiters looked as if they were rag-pickers picked up for the job. Not even a single boy knew his job. Fresh lime soda was served without lime. Arsalan Platter ( Rs 550) had 3 varitied of chicken, Tandoori was v good but the other 2 malai cheicken and chicken tikka was hard like rubber. Chicken piece in Biryani was hard enough to break-down the intestine but Mr.Stewart replaced it with a nice piece. For ice crean they suggested Butter Scotch . We asked for 7 scoops but they had only 5 in stock, so we compromised with 2 Kesar Pista serve after a long wait.

"The most famous ""Cal biriyani"" house has opened doors in Bombay and you will only need to ask any migrant Bong what a big relief cum achievement that is! Although Arsalan Bombay seems to have a different culture from its branches in Calcutta, but the food remains the same heavenly delicious fare.

While it has an extensive menu, Arsalan should be treated as a biriyani and chaamp house! Anything beyond that is a bonus. Several of my non-bengali friends have fallen in love with it at first bite!

"Let's be honest. The Arsalan in Mumbai does not quite match up to the standards set by their multiple outlets in Kolkata. However, I give it four stars considering that they would still make one of the best briyanis you'd find in Mumbai. Unlike most biriyanis in the city, their brand of Avadhi and dum cooked biriyani is very very good. Along with it you might want to savour Mutton Chaap which is rib pieces cooked lowly in a diminishing gravy. All for a satisfying meal. Other recommendations :

Special Arsalan Kebab - Mutton/Chicken (of the softest kind) wrapped in tandoored cheese.

Mutton Rezala - Soft mutton pieces in white curry. Totally worth it.

"Arsalan serves excellent bong style Mughlai food joint. Very famous in calcutta. Well is not like other Mughlai food joint where you stuck between Red or Green curry. I must say this is the authentic Mughlai restaurant. You will get nice and tender meat. Biryani is damn good,you can smell the aroma of spices form each grain of rice. Mutton champ is just brilliant. You can also try Chicken garlic kabab and chicken kasuri kabab. Well nothing special for Vegetarian's but Dal Makhni is worth trying. Overall a great restaurant for mughlai style meat lovers.m/"
very bad home delivery...the do no respect their customers ..i very clearly ordered for one dish but they were very careless in taking the order and sent two of them and did not take it in return... the dum biryani too is very bland .. in all a very bad experience .. moreover even at their restaurant every thing is lethargic they sluggishly take orders and take 30 -1 hr to give it
If you a vegetarian and ended up coming to arsalan with other non veg guys..have a dal makhni n lachcha paratha...forget about the oil n enjoy the flavour!! Loved it !!!
"A few friends and I had gone for dinner to Arsalan and were shocked at the quality of the food that they served. We ordered the Mutton Kakori kebabs and the Chicken Masala. The kebabs smelled bad and the texture was more of seekh kebabs, rather than kakoris. The waiter insisted that they were kakoris. They tasted horrible!!

The Chicken Masala was even worse and my friends had one bite each before returning the dish. The manager still claimed that ""sir you need to cut the pieces"", ignoring the fact that after 5 mins of trying to slice the piece with my fork, it still did not yield.

"Gone are the days when we used to pack Biryani - chaap from Kolkata and fly it down to Mumbai to devour the same with our families..Arsalan serves superb biryani..those from Kolkata would swear by it..yes, it's different from the Biryani's available in maximum city..but trust me, it is indeed brilliant and the typical authentic biryani that we have grown up eating back in Kolkata. The must try items here:

1) Mutton biryani - Chicken chaap combination
2) Tandoori roti - Mutton chaap combination.
3) Succulent mutton boti kebabs..can also try the cheese chicken kebab..although personally, not really a fav of mine.

Love you Arsalan, thanks for coming to Mumbai!"
I still cannot forget the taste of the mutton biryani that I had at Arsalan for the first time. It was mind blowing. A nice place for not only biryani but also normal gravy dishes although i feel the quantity is very less. Still a must try!
"Ok, so what does a quintessential Kolkata person miss the most in Mumbai apart from the usual Bengali sweets and Phuchka? Yes, of course....the legendary Kolkata Biryani with the ""egg and the aloo"" !!
So, needless to say, when Arsalan opened its doors in Mumbai, I was one of the happiest souls around.

Having eaten countless number of times at the Kolkata outlets, I decided to pay a visit to the Mumbai outlet and ordered my eternal favorites:

Arsalan Mutton Biryani- Apart from those small Muslim eateries, you don't get these kind of Biryanis anywhere in Mumbai. Yes, the ""aloo and the egg"" made their presence felt. Heaven !!
Mutton Rezala- I don't know how many people...read more"
"The best Bong-Mughlai food joint in Mumbai.

I am a bong, and I have been to all sorts of places in Kolkata which serves Mughlai food, like Biryani, Chicken Rezala, Tandoori etc. Very few places even in Kolkata can match the taste of Arsalan, Mumbai.

There is an Arsalan in Kolkata too, which I visited like 6-7 times. But still, Mumbai Arsalan is a light-year ahead of Kolkata Arsalan when it comes to ambience, food and taste.

I recommend all bongs and non-veg non-bongs to visit this place."
"VERY bad and aweful experience with arsalan. This sunday after noon we went to hav a roll we were 2 of us, our only mistake that at the entry whr you see the parcel counter, i told those guys that we want 2 chicken rolls. n we sat at a table right infrnt of the parcel counter... at least 5 waiters came and asked for our order i told them tht we need 2 chicken roll

whn we observed that the order dint come for 40 mins i asked the head waiter abt my order n then he comes with a parcel of 2 rolls and tells me that we have to leave the table since lot of crowd is coming in.... we were so disguisted and offended. we simply made our move after paying. it was raining so unfortunately i have to...read more"
"In recent trend Aralan's quality consiousness has gone done. May be they have gained the reputation since their opening in December.Charging 250/- bucks for special biriyani is always high as compare to Calcutta which is almost 100% high. I can write this because I am front Calcutta and recently tried biriyani there.I faced terrible problem three times after taking special biriyani as parcel. I order for extra alu which I pay for i.e.10/-.1st time when I took parcel I crossed checked fro the alu they told it's there inside when I insisted they gave me extra in a different container and told me three alus given. After reaching home when opened and checked, I was right only one existing. 02...read more"
I really liked the yesterday. Enjoyed after a long time.. the true taste of kolkata.. disappointing it didnt accept card?? kindly clarify does it accept credit cards?
"M from delhi and i recently visited mumbai for work and there i found this restaurant. I was going there for the first time so was a lil sceptical but i was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The chicken dishes,the quality of indian bread was good. It was an absolute value for money.
One dish which il relish a lot would be ""chicken chatpata"". Have'nt had any such dish in delhi. Was finger licking good."
"Loved the mutton kassa, barra kebab and the double egg rolls. The biryani could have been better, the naans we ordered were served cold after asking them to replace them we were still served cold naans which was a downer. The service needs to improve a lot, some of the waiters have absolutely no clue how to deal with guests. Having said that it has got the best mutton in the city a must try for any meat lover."
"Had a huge expectation from 'our' Arsalan. Ordered mutton arsalan biryani, horrendous!!! Never had such awful biryani in my life!!"
"There was a 20 minute wait on a Wednesday night which is good.
The Mutton Reshmi tasted pretty good but a few pieces were under cooked and chewy.
The Chicken Malai kebab was tender and devoured around the table as soon as it arrived.
The Tandoori Prawns were disappointing. Small and stale.
The Mutton Kakori was terrible. Dry and tasted more like a home made shammi kebab
The flavour of the Mutton Barra Chops was excellent, if i had any complaint it would be that they had slightly less meat on them.
The Yellow Dal was surprisingly my favourite dish of the night. I was apprehensive about trying a dal at a place like this because I expected it to be swimming in oil but it was packed with...read more"
"Heard a lot about this restaurant so ordered home delivery, they said it would take 1 hour so I had to get it picked up myself. My order - Chicken Biryani ""regular"" Brain Masala and Mutton Kheema masala. The only good thing about my order was the Biryani which was still average. The kheema and brain was so oily that after eating it the oil stuck to my plate and I had to drink warm water to wash it down. One of my friends even ended up puking the food out because he felt it was making him feel sick. OILY OILY OILY that's all I can say about the food. Not worth wasting your money and risking your health."
"Excellent Mughlai food, authentic aromatic Dum Biriyani is their specialty, the rolls just awesome. Atleast found the Kolkata style Mughlai food in Mumbai. My family are among the regulars."
