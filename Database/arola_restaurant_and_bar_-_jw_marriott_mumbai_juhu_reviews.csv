"Awesome place for a late night drink. Their bartenders are too good and would suggest you just the perfect drink and prepare it to blow your mind off. Their GIN collection is very good and have some rare gin varieties. Monkey 47 being my favourite. They also have cigar collection for the cigar lovers. Overall classy place. They also serve spanish food which is v nice too. Great music ambiance and crowd. What more you want with your fav drink in one hand and cigar in the other..!

"Small plates and gin drinks are two of my favorite ways to start a night out - and Arola is flush with both.
Located in the lavish JW Juhu, Arola struck me at first as more low key than the rest of the hotel, with a slightly colder, almost-art-deco-inspired ambiance, so I was surprised that the staff was trying to push the space as having a club feel rather than letting it flourish as a tapas/gin bar with a more relaxed feel.
The loud club music, which seemed out of place for such a laid-back set up, and the aloof staff (difficult to track down whenever a drink needed refreshing) were the only factors that would prevent me from returning - the food and cocktails were on point."
"A meal to remember, but at these prices, there's no excusing any mistakes. 

We came here not for any occasion, but because we were in the money-spending frame of mind (always very dangerous). And boy, Arola didnt disappoint on the wallet killing front. But, we did get some fairly good food, with some highs and lows, out of it. 

The highlights were the patatas bravas (duh), and the charcuterie plate (though nobody gets credit for putting cut meat on a nice plate). The garlic prawns were nice, but not spectacular (though we loved the fried crunchy garlic pieces). However, what really disappointed was the smoked salmon salad - the salmon was just not great quality, very very salty and...read more"
"Good Experience it's basically a Spanish restro with a good music ,ambience is great good view of the sea and also a pool side view which is rite at the bottom overall a Great place to spend some Quality time with your loved One.."
"A dinner with friends at Arola at the JW Mariott Hotel in Juhu was truly a meal to remember. The Spanish Chef de Cuisine Manuel Olveira Seller made our night truly memorable as at the end of the night we foodies couldn't make up our mind as to which dish was our favourite : in short every dish was spectacular. Gaurav from Arola also served us some amazing cocktails such as S3 which was Tanqueray Gin served with a lemon sorbet and flaked pistachios! Also, the Smoke Berry Mule cocktail added some real drama to our meal (see pics). Our dinner included dishes like Patata Bravas, Lime Guacamole, Lamb chops (the best in Mumbai), Salmon and goats cheese, Black Rice with Lobster, Chicken and Ham...read more"
View is just great.Had a awesome time with family but the food was pretty OK . except for pork everything else was just average. Great service but would expect more in terms of taste for the money u charge.
"Let me start off by saying
5 stars or maybe a bit more
Been to all top restaurants all over the world.
In Mumbai this is super value for the type of meals
It's on the pricey side but it is high end.
Gents get a nice suit jacket with a t shirt and roll in
Girls wear a nice dress or a slight Indian to western fusion outfit..
Dress to Impress.
Let's talk drinks and food

Food- amazing. ( lollipop chicken was what I had)
Drinks- well mixed

Service- amazing
Ambience- like a restaurant and bar ought to be

üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
Amazing !

After visiting this place.. I insist almost all my frnds to visit this place with very beautiful view of juhu beach and marriot's lovely pool side area... Worth spending here...
"Well it was a special occasion, and I decided to go for a Dinner Date at Arola, to enjoy a cuisine and food which I had never done earlier.

Named by the Michelin Chef ""Sergi Arola"", this place serves scrumptious and mesmerising FLAVOURFUL stuff.

We were 2 of us and had gone there on a Sunday Night. We had done a prior reservation for the same.

Starting with its plush, comfortable and romantic Ambiance. Nicely lit cute candles on each table setting up a perfect romantic date for you and your loved one.

Scented aromatic atmosphere to make you feel refreshed and extremely joyous.

Moving to the food here. We started with an appetiser called as the ""Patata Bravas""...read more"
"I can't say more, but insist that a visit is worth to this place. Great ambience, even greater food. The best part is we are getting luckier by the day that such wonderful Michelin star chefs are seeing so much love for food in India.
To sum up. Please plan a Lunch/dinner soon!!!"
"Love the sun downs here . Perfect place for a Sunday evening to hang out with friends or a romantic date,most of all it gives you a casual positive vibe by the interior and the view to look at."
Innovation by Cher Sergi Arola.. Vegetarian Paella! Perfect mix of flavors but the highlight was the artichoke and fried asparagus! #spanishfood #michelin #dining with #sergiarola #jwmarriottjuhu #foodie #foodporn #loveit
"Came here to celebrate my parents anniversary, the staff's hospitality and chief Manuel's brilliant food magic was a yummy in my tummy feeling. Thank you Arola üç∑"
"We came to Arola for my parents anniversary dinner, the staff although very warm was quite inattentive. We had to repeatedly ask for our glasses to be filled with water which in such an establishment should be on automatic. The food was very disappointing, only good things were the cheese croquettes and sour dough bread. Everything else we tried was average and the lamb ravioli was probably one of the worst things I've eaten at a restaurant. I would not recommend this place at all, very substandard."
"From the time we walked in. We were serviced by the warmest staff. Must mention aashish from udaipur who waited on us. Most helpful and obliging. A couple of drinks on the outside balcony area is a good idea before shifting in for dinner. The place is very well lit and the seating layout is interesting with personal pockets. Music could have been a bit more interesting instead of the regular night club hits that played but that hardly dampened the mood. The food was amazing.we ordered the Patata bravas... first dish mentioned on the menu and recommended to us was a knockout. It was cooked to perfection. A combination of potatoes, Tomatoes and galic mayo was just a beautiful balance of...read more"
"There aren't many restaurants with Spanish cuisine in Bombay. So I was excited to go to Arola, named after its famous chef.

Unfortunately the food wasn't very authentic but it wasn't bad either. Not a place I would go again but certainly a place that I would recommend people to try out once.

The seafood paella was the dish that stood out for me."
"Arola is an interesting review for me. Its kind of been the opposite of how an experience should be...Entered the market as a very high end place, but somehow fell short of expectations of many. I only heard negative comments since the beginning, pricing, arrogance, food quaiity etc...Everyone told me not to go...So I went there not expecting much and i was very pleasantly surprised. It was rather empty so the seating opportunities were a little odd. the main room on the right was closed, only leaving a terrace table, bar counter, or a two seater table near a private eating area. We sat there and enjoyed the ambience. The food was good! very good... The service was almost there, its the...read more"
"Without wasting time with the introduction, lets shift gears.
Location - JW Marriott Juhu.
Fantastic ambience at the entrance and when youre seated too.
The plates from which youre supposed to eat are very unique and resemble weird globoidal cuttings with dark bronze patterns. Loved the idea.

The order has to placed on an iPad.
We were all given iPad's to go through the menu. Theres no hard copy to see.
The concept seemed good at first, but after you place the order, you have to return the iPad back to the attendant, which basically eliminates written orders.
I didnt like it overall, but to each his own.

The FOOD now. My word. What presentation. What taste.
We called for Lamb Ravioli...read more"
If anyone is looking for privacy...then This place will surely live up to ur expectations. ..The best part is the ambience and it's open late night...If u happen to be here...dfntly try out the Cesar salad with chivas !!!!!!
The decor and ambience is brilliant. I think the options for veggies were limited. Didn't really like the Roasted Eggplant as I thought it was bland. Did enjoy the flat pizza though! It was really filling and delicious. It took them quite a while to clear the cheque despite being well staffed! Considering the place has 2 Michelin stars my expectations where high. Where's the Spanish touch?
"Had a fab night at Arola over Food Flattery and Friends. Excellent presentation. Real nice set-up. We just binged on appetizers all evening. Patatas Bravas, Pollo De Coral, Embutidos Espanoles, Gambas Al Ajillo, Coca De Verduras, Coca De Pollo Maruno.

Your diet is a bank account. Good food choices are good investments.

Hehehehe definitely a must visit.

All in All a fab experience."
"'Arola' by the Brilliant Chef Serge Arola is the best Spanish cuisine restautant in Mumbai, located @jwmarriot . The ambience, the decor and the food here made my food tasting experience here , a delightful one . I had the opportunity to personally dine with the Chef Serge Arola himself , and his amazing sence of humour made the food tasting session a memorable one . Talking about the food, the hospitality, the service and the overall experience at Arola was Incredible. Must eats here are the Patatas Bravas , CoCa Pizza's , Ravioli, Berenjenas(One of the best Eggplant dishes) & the Luscious Dessert Pina Brava (a perfect blend of pineapple, coconut and spicy berry sauce) . The food here...read more"
I visited this place based on a friend's recommendation... As soon as I arrived I have been seated out facing the ocean... Served chilled Gin cocktail which is the best I ever heard... The chef who is the assistant to a two star michellin chef carefully prepared beautiful chicken appetizers for me... Service was superb... Place is awesome... Must visit in Mumbai!!!
"The decor and ambience take my breath away , food was cooked to perfection. Being a Goan I do enjoy my seafood so I thought that the sauce inside the calamari sandwich could have been done better. The Patatas Bravas was yum but a little oily. The dessert was well plated & I really enjoyed it."
Thoroughly disappointed with the food here. Don't ever make the mistake of ordering the suckling pig and another dish with asparagus foam and sea food.. The mussels weren't cooked... Wouldn't go back here for sure...!!! The music doesn't compliment the ambience either.. This place is surely a miss...!!
Poor service. Very badly managed. So we were staying at the hotel n decided to tour around and check eating options. Bumped into arola their spanish restaurant. The front desk boy says we can order a set menu n the portions are huge to serve 2 ppl. Wow!! Booked the place. Came for dinner and the server said the same. Out came his ipad n ready to help us with selection. Confused ho gaya phir came back with manager who arrogantly says u 'cannot' share set course. So ofcourse i walked out in protest. Y so ? An international restaurant ought to know whats allowed n not allowed and more so have all employees on same footing. Horrible experience. And fearing that the mgr could easily pass off...read more
"Nice place to try some Spanish food!
It's in JW Marriott, Juhu, ambience is awesome! Was a bit tough to find the place once inside JW, but once we did we were ushered in and given a choice of tables.
Most of the menu has changed, and the menu is now iPad and not a hard copy - Very Cool!
Being strangers to Spanish cuisine, we asked for recommendations and also asked about a few dishes we were curious about.
A must try is the lamb preparation in Chef's Special, comes topped with a very tasty sauce.
We also tried the lobster rice, which also comes with prawns. The rice, lobster and the special sauce is all blended in and tastes great!

Pretty hefty price tags but well worth the experience!"
"""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" Went the famous lines of Humphrey Bogart, and we walked right into this. 

Well just the fact that Mumbai has a bar that specialises ( read takes pride, and rightly so) in its Gin Collection.
This one has been in our wish list for the longest, and finally we made it two weeks back. 

Here it goes, 

Ambience - Situated at the Lobby level of the very plush JW Marriot , it has a modern, and clean design, that immediately calls out for an indulgent evening. With comfortable seating scattered around, and some private spaces created with a lot of care, the setting blends perfectly with the ambience. The only...read more"
Love the lobster rice here!!!! Been here for the 7th time now in 2 years!!!
"I was very excited when Arola opened its door in Mumbai as it added another Michelin-star-level restaurant in the gastronomic scene in the city though it is at JW Marriott which is super far away from my area.
I love the atmosphere and the decoration of the restaurant. Though i have been seated in the same area almost all the time which is the first dining area on the right hand side when you enter Arola. I don't like the sofa which is way too low comparing to the dining table that each time if i had to sit on the sofa, i had to put the pillow underneath..hehe.
Another thing is that i find the set menus far worthier than the √† la carte menu (price wise of course as you get smaller...read more"
"What do I comment on this wonderful place "" Arola "" simply superb

Gr8 Ambience, excellent service, most awesome spanish cuisine

Would surely be a regular henceforth for this wonderful food & lovely flavor"
Superb ambience and music! Finally went there and place was worth the wait. Not pricey for what they serve.... Must have non veg bombs and prawns with garlic.....drinks are very different and good for a change of taste than the usual ones.....STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
"I visit Arola with my office pals. It was Sunday evening but the place was deserted. There were only 7 of us there for an hours or so from 8:00 pm. The interiors are excellent, the staff was very polite, smiling & helpful but the place was dead ! We had couple of drinks and don't remember what starters and took off in just little more then an hour. Since, it is in JWM food & alcohol were heavy on pocket. Not sure if it's its worth it."
Nice place.
"Best spanish food served here...there suggestions went best with me for veg food,loved their complimentary dish to the most ,pior reservation is must so that u don't miss the best outdoor sitting..impressed!"
Off the hook ... Chef Manuel ( hope the spelling is right ) served up some insane food .. Pic attached... Ask chef recommendation .. Some awsome pork and seafood .. Also some really good veg tapas .. Also try the sangria and gin with tonic it's their
"Best tapas in Mumbai for sure. What an amazing menu, everything looked so good, that we actually ended up ordering a lot and had to doggy bag. The suckling pig and mash was amazing, so was the fillet mignon. The pork carpaccio was full of flavor. Will recommend these 3 dishes if you love your meat. The only thing I can even think about complaining about would be the moody lady who waited on us (she never smiled once) and forgot my drink, but that is easily forgiven."
"Girls night out at Arola. Beautiful restaurant with an indoor and outdoor seating area and a swanky bar. They had a DJ playing some cool hip music. We had our meal paired with some great wines. We ordered The Iberian ham with bread tomato, suckling pig with truffle infused sweet potato, potato bombs, squid ink angel hair pasta with prawns squid and sea bass, lobster rice, pork carpaccio and lamb / portobello ravioli with garlic chili jus all exceeded our expectations in taste. Absolutely delicious! The service was excellent and prompt. The plating, presentation and quality of the food was true to Chef Manuel Olveira style. The food was really delicious and we can now see ourselves as...read more"
Food and drinks are great. But the best part is outdoor seating. I think that makes this place along with everything else a great place.
"Extremely courthouse and well informed staff.
This is probably the best service I've received in the city.

They've remained the authenticity of tapas."
"It was an evening time & sun was about to say goodbye & we though to have a nice sunset near juhu beach. Alora is a perfect place for smooth & lavish experience with your beloved. They have indoor as well outdoor seating area. Food was toothsome. They also have extensive collection of gins from across the globe which they have displayed. Though food & alcohol heavy on pocket, its worth. The staff was very polite, smiling & helpful. In short hospitality at their best. All together a lovely ‚Äì peaceful time with my love."
Pricey! Very Pricey! food is good of course. went for a sundown and now have to stop going out for two weeks.
"Go here for one of the best Filet Mignon in Mumbai! It is tender and rich at the same time, as it should be. Enjoy the meat with some Sangria, and the soulful music. You are golden!

I am usually not a Wasabi fan, but the one served with the Filet Mignon here had the right balance. It hits your taste buds, but does not leave a overpowering after taste.

My friend had the lamb ravioli. I personally love lamb. I personally love Ravioli. The dish was so good I almost exchanged plates with her :) The chilli garlic mix that comes with the ravioli enhances the dish to a superior level.

I have noted before that however unlikely it sounds, fish and potatoes are generally a super combo. For a...read more"
"The best sangria you can have in Mumbai. Decent paella, too salty
But a very friendly staff."
"Arola is the first true Spanish Restaurant in Mumbai, and probaly in India.

Arola is located at the JW Marriot Hotel in Juhu, for over one year now, and is the Indian branch of the famous Michelin two star Madrid-based Arola Restaurant.

Chef Manuel Olveira brings to Mumbai the traditional spanish food combined with the singular sensitivity of the Arola cuisine.

I would go for the degustarion menu, with a set of amazing dishes. An original recipe of pa amb tom√†quet - bread, with spanish extra virgin olive oil and tomato - comes first, with a sign to the Indian customers as it's been adapted to them with naan instead.

Then you would enjoy a set of different both cold and hot...read more"
"Michelin star Chef Sergi Arola's signature restaurant lives up to its Catalan cuisine. we liked Arola's culinary concept Pica Pica - a number of Chef's creative fare served on a platter. the view of gentle waves of Arabian sea, from the extended section is dreamy....you can just sit here and gaze with a drink. of course, being a restaurant of JW property, one can expect the decor to be classy and the bill to be pricey.

Patatas Bravas with herbed tomato sauce and sour cream topping gets full marks. Gambas al Ajillo also tops with prawns seeped in red chilly and parsley exuding a garlicky zest. Paella came in stone bowls and tasted good. but Fideuda de Verduras was too oily for our...read more"
"Recommendations-Patata bravas
-some cheesy rice(cant recollect the name now)
-crema catalana
amazing service as well!"
"From the food to the service i have never seen worth in bombay. The food is terrible, the service very poor (one of our dish was missing even if you place your order on ipad). At 9pm the music (michael jackson) became so loud that we couldnt talk anymore. The food is very very far from spanish cuisine.
I stay in Bombay since 3 years and i have never had such a bad experience. The food even made me sick.

To avoid. There are so many great places in bombay."
Awesome place for a change of taste!!! All the joy of being in Spain in INDIA itself!! The interior is very classy!! love this place!!
"Its a very good restaurant in terms of ambience & service, but where as food is concerned its no where close to the other restaurants in JW Marriott. Lot of variety for Non-vegetarians but very limited for a few friends of mine who are purely vegetarians. But great sundown parties!"

When we booked we were told there was a dress code but that was okay as really good food is a good occasion to dress up for. What followed was very very under-whelming.

What makes this even better is the Spanish food which is not so common in the city. The variety is good with a decent number of sea food dishes.

They also have a well stocked bar with enthusiastic servers who are always willing to spin a drink according to your taste.
