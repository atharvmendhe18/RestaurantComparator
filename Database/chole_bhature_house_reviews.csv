Review
packaging was not proper total taste less compare to previous order amd in complimentary onion and pickle which was given useless things provided
""
Chole was on a spicier side and Bhature was just a bigger poories. Never seen such a small size Bhature😀😀 Only best thing was packing.
Every thing is fine.
""
The curd was old and stale
hygiene food with proper packaging

taste is pathetic old rice not fit to be run this type of hotel cheating public
Very much salted
Taste has been totally changed... Quality is very bad... god knows what happen to chole bhature house
very bad chole bhature n no packing material in this restaurant
"I was expecting better ,when I ate it on their shop was better 2years before but now👎👎👎"
"chole was good, but aaloo stuffed and paneer bature is not up to the mark bcoz it is very difficult to find Aaloo and paneer or taste"
no taste at all. and bhatura was smelly.and very slow delivery
Baturas were nice but the Chole was bitter and found 2 hairs in that.
Disappointed about the quality of food.
very good food every time thank you I get order in properly on time
I have order chole rice and chole bahture and all the combination of chole and bhature perfect. Pure delhi authentic taste . Love it keep it up such taste. 🤗🤗🤗🤗

I ordered Aloo stuffed bhatura.. first of all.. only touch of aloo... no filling found... secondly.. bhatura was brown from outside.. however raw from i side... al maida was coming out from middle.. entirely raw... Vendor must have used very hot oil.. which made bhatura instantly became brown.. however did not cooked bhatura from inside..
"Not test like real chole and preparation not good,"
over used of soda in bhatura n chole is quite bitter
Very yummy paneer paratha and samosa . Best authentic North Indian taste .🙂🙂🙂🙂😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Pure Delhi wala taste hai and keep it guy ......................... Definitely order again and again 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
bhautra was ok but the chole ws smelling very bad in taste and was deteriorate
"Burnt Aloo paratha, tasteless Chole. Totally hopeless"
"worst chole bhature. chole was black in color, too much salt and bitter in taste."
"the paratha were great good taste but the chole was less than average infact bad. the curd was too less...
also the restaurant took more than 30 mins just to prepare the food
seems they has closed the restaurant but kept the Zomato app on."
On time delivery. Good quantity. Taste wise it was ok can give it a try for once.But definitely improvement is needed in gravy. Bhature was good. provide lemon also with salad
The paratha was not worth the cost at all. It was tasteless. Not tried anything else from the seller.
Not good at all. chole are not cooked and bathure taste bad ...
Your food is delicious no doubt about it but the packaging was worst all the chole was dropping in that plastic bag and even last time I had submitted a review but nobody got back I understand restaurant can be out of stock with the food ordered but don't you think that the person who placed an order should be notified. please check past reviews too
bhature mein paneer nahin aur chhole mein namak nahin faltu ekadam
"taste was not upto the mark, bhatura was tasteless"
I am not giving you a rating of 1 because your food is good but you did not send the order I placed there is no Aloo bhatura in the order it's just 4 normal bhature. Thank you for sending 2 normal bhature instead of 1 aloo bhatura but you should have called me and inform if something is not available
WASTE OF MONEY coke given in it but given big cola
the food was very cold n half Order food & coke bhi nhi Diya
"Uncooked Cholle, Sending ORO Cola instead of mentioned BIG COLA in menu, order delayed for 1 hour on restaurant. most unpleasant experience I have had. They write SPECIAL PANEEL CHOLLE BHATURE, and then theres no paneer with Cholle, game of words and nothing else. But we are not stupid."
Once again I have order chole bhature and Samos a. I like so much the chole taste and bhature less oil . All combination of chole and Bhatura perfect .
"pathetic taste .... disappointed
Never ever I order from ur hotel
U need to improve ur taste
It was not chole bhature ,it was something daal type... Unhappy vid ur service"
we had received aloo paratha one only just seeen now it's should be two
"The taste was not so good, but it could have been better."
"Never had such horrible chole batura,and the samosa was old."

Taste of Chole was really very good same like Delhi wala. had some issue with Bhatura but that' happens some time. Lasso was good and chilled served would be much better
""
"Chole was bit salty, and bhatura was nice but oily"
""
Chole quantity was less as compared to Bhature...
""
Bhaturas which was served not up to the mark what i really felt
