"i ordered surmai thali in which there are two veg sabji 1 rasam n half piece of fish wat abut chicken fry

stop giving a fake menu if u can't proceed it PATHETIC ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"
Too many green chillies in stew and cut same size and shape as french beans takes away pleasure of eating an otherwise tasty dish

"The ambiance upstairs here is amazing, they have great music playing all the time. The staff is cooperative, the best part is you don't have to wait too long to get the orders. Veg or Non veg, the Food is great!"
"They have a variety of non-veg foods satisfactory to the majority of taste buds.
Loved the parotta and Appam, Thali is amazing as well."

"the juice was not fresh and it was too sweet (sugar was added a lot) t was like essence was added and not fresh juice.

when you are charging so much give fresh juice ."
"Really disappointed with the quality food.
I ordered chicken biriyani and quality for the meat was sooooo bad that I suffered very badly from food poison and took 3 days to recover. Please take care of the quality of the food."

quantity is too low
no taste
the chicken kondattam was overcooked and chewy. the appam and parottas were actually really good.
"worst food I ever purchased from here.
the food was stained and also the delivery agent was very rude.

this is the worst experience for me...
please kindly improve."
"Taste was not up to perfection, guess was a rushed order"

Food was good in terms of taste and quantity but there was one problem that there were egg shells in the egg roast. Which is not good

"The restaurant staff kept lying about the delivery time.. we live close to the restaurant and due to some personal reasons I couldn't come to collect food myself. It took 50+ mins to deliver!! we tried to call and request to fasten the process!! But to our shock, we were given incorrect answers and the last call was an utter lie!! Sharing the screenshot of 50+ of my order time!!"
Portion was not satisfied as per price

"Thallassery chicken biriyani was pathetic .
They spoiled not only the biryani , they spoiled thallassery also .
Couldnt even eat quarter portion .
Full of oil with dried rice and chicken .
I really dont know from where they get this name .
Simply spoiled my whole night
Not trying to order from here anymore"
staff is not good... they don't check order what the pack in parcel.. wrong food delivered.
very bad taste and they didn't send any cutlery after we asked them to send it.
Worst Biriyani I ever had. Not even a biriyani. Will never recoment to anyone.
"The Kerala poratta was not cooked properly it was half cooked and it felt like you are eating half cooked maida. The amount taken for mutton curry and the quantity delivered is way too less it‚Äôs just like small 4 pieces like 100rs per mutton piece?. Disappointed
Being a Malayali I should say not up to the mark and not justified to the ratings and the cost charged"
""
We had the prawn putty and the surmai tawa that was suggested by the manager and it was absolutely delicious. Must try!!
""
"Ordered chicken 65 instead of chicken 65 Kerala style . It was really bad. Inspite written in instructions, chicken was not cooked and half raw. Box was filled with oil . Guess they can‚Äôt make Chinese food"
""
"packaging needs to be done more carefully.
has it leaked"
Using kerala name to sell this kind of third class biriyani.Don't order food from here. Zomato should bann this kind of resturant.Rice is not cooked properly and they used very cheap quality rice to make this.Charging 350 rupees for this worst biriyani and i can buy a far better biriyani from road side for just rupees 80/100.

Too greasy
