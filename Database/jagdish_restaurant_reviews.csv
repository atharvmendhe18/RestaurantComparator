This one‚Äôs a go to place. One of my fav restaurants. They serve super delicious and very yummy food. The butter garlic chicken and the fish chilly is a must try. They provide quick and good service. Definitely should visit this place.
"This place has gotten a lot better since new management has come, food is excellent. Prompt service and value for money. Perfect place to order for midnight cravings, you will not be disappointed."
Quatity is too low and they ae charging 399..and least bother to return the item..even the stuff is cool its not hot..dont visit this hotel
"An ideal place to have a casual family dinner or a few drinks with friends.

It's located on the way to the famous Shanmukhananda hall, just round the corner. It has a big board outside it's a easy find.

It's an all AC place with no outside seating arrangement. It has seating on the ground and first floor.

In case of family the first floor area is much suitable since it is more spacious.

The staff are quick and always a call away from your table which I really found good.

Must try dishes would be their Chicken afghani kebab and fish tandoori(rawas) in starters. Also, they serve chicken tikka in white and red marination. Do try their white marination, something what sion koliwada is...read more"
