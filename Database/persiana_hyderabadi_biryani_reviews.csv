Review
tastes average
Is this biriyani? Flavourless white rice and some chicken pieces
The food was not great there was nothing hyderabadi about the food it's just regular food. The custard is all mashed up. The a agar kebab had nothing spicy about them sadly.
quantity and the quality of is really very bad

The restaurant has scammed me by sending only white rice along with 3 chicken pieces. There is no masala at all. It was completely unable to eat.
"I recommend

"The taste of the biryani is justtt wooowwww!!!
