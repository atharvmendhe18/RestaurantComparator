"Less quantity, No masala in Biryani rice making it bland. To make it worse, raita was also less. Extremely disappointing. Gave an extra star because of adequate Mutton pieces in the biryani."
"Dil se banaaye hote to dono item jalta nai....itna kaun jalake bhejta hai bhaai, Paisa deke mangwaye the...aap khud hi photos me dekhlo, aadhe to phenkne me chale gaye, Mazza v nai aaya aur paisa v waste ho gaya"
Taste is disappointing

"It is good food and service. Went here for lunch and ordered Mutton Barra ( good ) and Mutton Nihari ( very good ), shawarma (very good) and chicken fried rice ( very good ). Overall good experience"

Biryani was not upto Mark .. chicken was under cooked .. & very sticky / rubbery .. No taste .. bad
chicken was dry hard and tasteless
""
very dirty
"the quantity was barely there
super oily, had to literally drain 1/10 of the dish free of oil, attaching photo for container comparison
not even tasty"
Except the gimmicks of Ahmed bhai as a name. Highly over rate food. mutton biryani was 3 peice of Bone and a little mutton. They charge you 350 for a bone biryani. Rice is sufficient but very dry . Over all not worth to spend high amount at this place when you can get the same at so many options. Also had Paneer Tara pulao. Worst item only masala haldi rice with paneer. The chefs are local untrained staffs..

The delivery partner was amazing
