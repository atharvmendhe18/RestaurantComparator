Review
"Ark,
i have visited for the first time, crowd is okay.
Dj rahil is the best amongs the rest. Bartenders are smart enough & helpful.
Enjoyed a lot."
"Ark by Courtyard Marriott is an amazing place for having a party & a really good time.
The staff is really welcoming and takes no time to learn your drink preferences. I had some of the best cocktails and TBH just the right amount of buzz. I tried ( Long List ) - The Gotham martini, The spring time love martini, Expresso martini, Silver bullet martini, The polo mint martini And tenessy smooth criminal martini.
The starters were also delicious and served all fresh & hot. I loved the potato cheese poppers & the mushrooms.
Honestly never reached the main course. Also, they serve Stella which is definately now my favourite beer.
Alric, one of the guys from the Staff was definitely the most...read more"
"Been here with friends on weekdays..very warmth service, Tried bocconchini bruschetta and some bar special cocktails.
Loved the ambience and service."
Fell in love with the ambience of the place. Roswell was very ethical and professional in his work. Service was of good quality and standard was not compromised.
"Amazing experience at ARK Bar at Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai. Great Food, good music, great service, fantastic staff. a must visit the place, high profile outlet."
"A very amusing and wonderful place , good music and lovely food and an amazing overall experience highlighted by its mesmerizing ambience created by the well versed DJ who knows how to keep the crowds always dancing and in a good mood for the entirety of the night which you never realise how fast it passes by."
Great ambience and equally great service!! Definitely worth visiting time and again. The Marriott tag is totally justified with great service and overall experience.
Had a great time here specially the martini choices were really great and the atmosphere is very relaxing too. Will come back again for the martini
Had been up here for a sat night ... really enjoyed the place and the fpod and the dance floor was on fire... im gonna surely gonna come over here with bunch of my freinds.
"This place is jussttt amazingggg!! I would definitely recommend this place if one wants to have a quality time.
The food,the ambiance,the bar makes it just perfect place to hang out."
Awesome place for a weekend hangout.. great atmosphere.. one of the best DJs to take it to another level of fun.. the bartender knows his stuff. Wonderful service.. Had a Blast!
Had been here with friends really enjoyed the cocktails and a relaxing place... Will come back for sure on a club night. Ark keep it up guys.
"This is a high-end destination lounge, where the food and drink is greatt value given the kind of quality we had enjoyed. A surprisingly light and airy resto, despite being in a basic wooden floor room, had a really buzzy and sexy atmosphere at ARK Bar, and dining are nicely designed spaced apart. Other than a dark brown wall at the rear of the restaurant that would benefit from a feature of some sort, we also loved the décor (especially the wine-box wall) – we’ll be returning for a special occasion and have this great place to enjoy.

"Awesome ambience, quality Food, all cocktail's available here.This club is happening and provides the best nightlife experience !! Recommend this place to family and friends....."
This place is great. The drink menu has lots of good beers that are hard to come by in Utah and the bratwurst are delicious.... I’m big fan of ark bar but with all the good reviews I decided to give it a try here. And it was excellent and my friend also enjoyed it.. He got the chicken well I had rosted chicken bucket. The only thing that I would recommend for to please visit this place atleast once.
"Went for a gig , the moonboots one.
Inside the courtyard by marriot is this club which is a bit compact but nicely arranged.
You can find good artists playing here on a regular basis. (Probably👅).well wouldnt mind going there next time.
Keep getting good artists and will keep hopping in 😋

The Ark Lounge has been my best place to watch live screenings of matches and have a drink while I am at it.. Their handcrafted cocktail menu is one to surely try and savour !! Roswell and gaurav will make sure that you get tipsy and have a great time ..
"Had an amazing time at the Ark bar really recommend this place as it's the best venue for clubbing and nightlife.. Sanket,Roswell and Gaurav made my experience here great and memorable!! Thumbs Up Team Ark!!"
Crowded place to visit on weekends .me and my friends enjoyed alot.bartenders make really nice smoky cocktails smoked desire was really good cocktail.cheers to bartendes and cheers to ark team.

"Worst experience ever.

Must try...."
Visited here on a Friday night. Been here once before also. Ambience is good though the place is quite small. Lot of bouncers so safety isn’t an issue. Club lights and sound systems are good. Enjoyed the music too as it was Eli and Fur (Arjunadeep). The disappointment was that we were denied the gold benefits (2+2 on drinks). The bartender said they had ‘timings’ or something like that which didn’t make any sense to me. They’re on the list of premium gold restaurants so I did not expect this. Plus a magnum pint priced at 600 bucks is ridiculous in my opinion. There are other better alternatives so one can give this place a miss.
I didn’t get any 2+2 drinks benefit here. Very disappointing. Manager said they dnt ve any tie up with zomato gold. Music was not really great. Ambience was ok.
"A place to chill with friends and family.😊😊
Excellent food and beverages.😋😋
Executive Bar tender Mr. Roswell D'silva with his Fine techniques to make perfect cocktails 💙💯"
"Visited this place for my friend's birthday party. The food and ambience were amazing. The staff was great too, very courteous. Will go back for mine. :)"
The food was really appeling and presentation was eye catching. The bar team also is very effecient to prepare the orders quickly. The staff is very generous and polite. Staff also has a good knowledge of the menu with very well recommendation.
The ambience is awesome. I enjoyed a lot with my family. The drink items are good and food has various choices. The staff is cordial and service at the bar is quite good & quick too. Ark Bar is a great place to hang out! Its worth trying once.
"A great place with good music, amazing food, ambience that is eye catching also the friendly staff and refreshing beverage ... Overall this place is amazing"
Been here for Saturday night. Music and lights were mesmerized by us. Food is bit expensive. Ambiance is good. Bollywood music after 1am. Stag entry is not allowed. Free entry for girls and couples.
One of the best place in Mumbai . Perfect night out.Grt ambience .Thanks to DJs .We enjoyed a lot love the drinkssss...staffs are very courteous very attentive .
This is one of those so called elite clubs who doesnt care for the customers but only the owners..on 29th december 2017 me and group of 5 friends had been there for some Saj Akhtar DJ night which was hyped like it was going to be a great grand night till 5am..and we paid 4k for the entry..1:30 in the night the bouncers came in and closed it saying the owner has a private party to host..i mean are you serious? if the place is just for your owner to party then why the hell do u have a night organized for patrons? ..never visitng this unproffesional shitty space again.
"The ambience of the ARK BAR is quiet good

One of the best club I ever visit great Bollywood music with dj paroma drinks are never had before overall good experience love the place and staff was friendly with us
"The place was simply amazing.... Ambience was awesome.. Went for Jai Veeru Night DJ Akthar and DJ Akbar sami music was at his best.....
Drinks were bit pricy compared to other lounge but that's ok... considering the Marriott group...
Only disappointment was they didn't gave us the zomoto gold membership offer on 2+2 drinks coz of that i would rate them 4.0
But over all nice place to hang out with friends and have a blast....
Thanks"
"Been to the place.. I would say its overrated.. although the food was good, yet the cost is also one of the parameters for the reviewal! Can find a lot better places with better music in the vicinity itself!"
Had gone for thd halwai brunch today....it was indeed a huge spread of sweets and deserts... almost around 70 to 80 of them...and good to taste too.... there were 7 to 8 types of samosa ...like cheese ..punjabi...patti etc...3 types of kachoris...dhokla patra kandwi pattice....nice taste but all were served ice cold which we didnt like.....soup was also served cold....nd were told that these things gad to be eaten cold...service was ok...ambience below average....main course not up to mark...
