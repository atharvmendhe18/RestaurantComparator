"Pathetic service , irresponsible management, worst recommendation for food. Looks as if no manpower , captain named Samir inspite of knowing it all didn’t bother on the service provided. All they have is a Sorry to say."
You forgot to put the bacon
The order isn’t delivered
Went for Sunday brunch. Wide variety. Including vegetarian. Almost all dishes well prepared. Excellent salad options and well presented. Main course had interesting items not seen regularly. Many dessert options. Worth a visit again
I like pizza
Next time pls dont give stale mashed potatoes

Didn't get the Cole slaw

Small stone type thing found in the roast chicken. Hurt my tooth. Thankfully didn’t eat it. Not safe. Lost customer.

Packing was very bad there was lot of leakage in food and drinks that was sent by a five star hotel food was cold only Puri was little warm and pancakes was like thin fulks roti
Ordered the veg combo meal; it was good but still requires improvement in terms of taste. The food was very oily (despite negative instructions) with no options. They should innovate and may charge extra for the food so that it is upto the mark
"Good food & good service staff !!
Service was bit slow but overall good 💯
They made my birthday special by giving us complimentary pastry cake."

The worst food ever. iconic jjagah ka naam duba diya......
"The food was not good at all. Definitely not worth the price they expect us to pay. The decor is stale and seems like the management has just given up. The curtains are dirty, the seat covers are old and stained. Even the service isn't good at all, they just don't seem interested to have you there. Feels just like a govt office

The only saving grace is the hotel itself. It carries with itself it's history of being amongst India's first beachfront hotels and it's nice to be there as the hotel remains calmly nestled in the beautiful nook of juhu"
Amazing great ambiance really enjoyed my Dinner date n food was yummm 😋 n delicious...loved the atmosphere

Absolutely pathetic service on food and billing. Worst is they don't care that their service is bad!!!.

So so disappointed. We came with such high hopes but completely third grade experience. Waited on our table for 20 min. No one offered water. The manager wasn't even interested in taking our order. The table in front of us was completely messy with flies running over it. We finally left without eating. Never coming back!
"Hello guyss
I really see the best food front of me i forget to takes picture 😅 the best place for frnds and couple open area Seaview i will enjoy having dinner at night 🥳🎉"
"A very serene, hygienic place with beautiful views of the sea..
the food is quite fresh and the flavors are good.. was genuinely surprised by the quality of the food, exceeded expectations.. absolutely loved the tandoori kumbh (mushrooms) and the oriental rice with gravy.. dumplings and the burger was decent too..
Covid precautions taken here are impressive."
"By no way yesterday was a ""Sun n Sand"" experience. Especially when ""Sun n Sand"" is known for food.
I had a special guest whom I had to entertain and was coordinating with Mr. Dheeraj Kumar since3-4 days.
In fact we had ordered for chicken kali Miri tikka but on Mr. Dheeraj Kumar's word, we changed it to surkh murg tika.

Mouth of the water jug had stains.
I had to be quiet and drink the water because I was the host.

Two Plates had hair fallen.
One was size of hair on finger / wrist.
Other was hair length.

I had to endure because again I had suggested my guest Sun n sand.

Waiters were more interested in laughing loudly and gossipping amongst themselves at the door...read more"

The staff is extremely hospitable
"So we went here for a buffet, a good place for spending time with family decent layout with good choice of dishes, from chaat to live grills and amazing options in the mains, a loads of desserts and a spectacular view of the juhu beach, this place is worth the money.
If your looking for a fine dine buffet which is not as taxing on the stomach then this place is surely something that you need."
Sameer gave the best service. Well done. Food also was great.

"Aqua is one of the places, the core menu of which is only available in the prime dining hours. And despite having been to this restaurant hundreds of times before, we hadn't tried the core menu up until now. We had gone for an easter brunch and the presentation, the buns, the patty and the salads were absolutely delicious. Everything was satisfying to a hungry stomach and hungry eyes, if not better! Must visit restaurant for sure :)"
Beautiful place beautiful ambience and super food of the restaurant Aqua ! By the beach peaceful place !

My special appreciation and commendation goes to Mr SameerSonawane who gave us personal attention. I commend him for the excellent service I received from him. You have set the bar very high.
"Very nice place to go on a date
Beach side view
Food was excellent
Staff was friendly
Ambience was amazing."
Good food. Good ambience. Value for money and great variety. A must visit for all the foodies out there.
Beautiful view of the Arabian sea with great food. Especially the veg biryani which was light on stomach without compromising on taste. Very courteous staff as well.
"Sun N Sand is pretty famous for hosting promotion & film events, so you might spot a star or two. I had heard a lot about this one, and wanted to taste the food. I ordered a Pomodoro sauce Penne pasta with extra veggies and a Peach Ice Tea. Both of which were swell, very fresh. Good enough for two people. As stated by the cafe also , it is expensive. But you can go there to enjoy the view and grab a bite."
"What you're paying for is the gorgeous view. The hot chocolate was unbearable, and the spaghetti we ordered was a bit dry. Quick fix by drizzling some olive oil on top though. Would recommend visiting though, the sea looks spectacular!"
"Disappointed.
Had a bad day, the staff spilled food over my shirt.
Spent over 1 hour arguing.

Above that, the food was not upto the mark.
The paneer makhanwala was too watery
And the breads also were not good."
A place which makes us feel good and calm once visited. The food is very mouth watering . Over again if I talk the the staff and service it's the best. The ambience is also too good.
Craving for some homely food i ordered Daal fry And steamed rice and jeera aloo at this coffee shop of Sun n sand . The food was yummy the daal tempered with jeera and heeng was perfect and so were the jeera aloo . My partner had the biryani and it was delicious with a generous amount of desi ghee added which lent the biryani a great flavour. The meat was tender and the rice fragrant..Great place for a multi cuisine meal..Cheers

"Visited this place for a dinner buffet, the starters were great but didn’t have a lot of variety, the spaghetti pasta was fine, main course wasn’t that tasty as compared to the other places but the Prawns Pulav was amazing as it was very rich in flavours."
The starters were good but indian dishes were not great at all.service is mediocre. Was disappointed as always had great food in sun n sand.
"This hotel is rated 4 star, but trust me they staff lack professionalism, food quality was good, place ambience was average...not professionally managed."
We had a great visit post mid night relaxed cafe and good food worth all the time spent 👌👌👌Service is surprisingly super fast considering it was almost 3am and all alert to hear us and deliver
"Had been here for dinner, the experience for service to food was bad, we waited for 45mins for the food and later ended up ot getting what we ordered in veg and kn reordering we ended up having an issue on that too. Roti and naan were dry and cold,really a poor experience"
"So I and my friends ended up visiting Aqua at Hotel Sun N Sand last night for a late night Birthday dinner. We ordered for lamb Dum Biryani, veg pesto sauce pasta and Bolognaise chicken pasta and everyone loved the food. Most of us ended up finishing everything even though we'd already had our dinners .
Amongst desserts we only ordered for molten chocolate cake with ice cream along with some amazing cold coffees.
Loved the service and the hospitality. I must mention specifically the staff at Aqua are really very sweet.
Perfect for Sunday brunches, late night dinners since the place is open 24*7 and the lovely beach view is an added advantage!!
And last but not the least they accept ZOMATO...read more"
"Ashutosh tiwari did a good service with smile on his face and also gave a good suggestions .Nice view good hygiene and good food .
Did enjoy here nd want to come again"
"Keshav at Aqua is a rockstar and an asset to the restaurant. Great service, great food and fairly reasonable prices as well. Had a great birthday celebration with family - everyone enjoyed the food. Only improvement I could suggest is the fish tikkas came slightly charred at some edges."
"If you are here for the view, you're in the right place, but if you are here for the food, think again.

Aqua is a popular Cafe because of its location, right on the beach, allowing you to sip your coffee while watching the sunset for the comfort of an air conditioned venue. The service is also very good, but for me an eatery is only as good as it's food. On that count, aqua leaves much to be desired"
"Good food, great service, thank you @Ashutosh for you suggestions and amazing service with smile. It was great being here and your service was excellent."
"Based upon reviews given by fellow zomatiates visuted the restaurant for buffet dinner.Got a parking and proceeded towards the restaurant after crossing the lobby.This is an AC restaurant located close by to two otger restauranta in the same hotel.The swimming pool lies close by and there is a beautiful view of tge sea.The bugfet spread consisted of the regular items like soup,salad,live counyer,main course and desserts.All in all the food and ambience was really good however the service needed improvement cause tge waiters seemed lost in their own world.Good to yake yiur family."
Potato veges are mind blowing... cappuccino and cookies were awesome....french fries were also good... ambience is awesome....u can njoi the view and a perfect gateway with awesome food...sun sand and sea is all I need ....will love to go here on my special occasions...
"Had a great time at Aqua, a cafe situated in Sun n Sand
Truly a magical space at sunset time and a great place to have your evening tea

Ambience 4/5
But after your food when you wander out to their huge terrace next to the sea it’s a 5/5
The view is stupendous
The restaurant is a nice place with columns done in blue tiles
Buffet is also served here but we had gone in the evening to try their All Day Cafe
We were lucky to be allowed to order from their Sip n Snack as well

Food:
Chilly cheese toast : 5/5 delicious and yummy
Recommend it highly
Exotic Bake of Corn and baby Spinach : 5/5 yummy alright. Strongly Recommeded
Came with garlic toast on the side
Vegetable Cutlets with...read more"
Polite and nice service especially ashutosh tiwari did good and helped a lot nice food nice ambience and best quality food would like to visit once again
"It was a lovely evening and good hospitality by Ashutosh @Aqua... good view and good food. Worth it. Maintaining the good hygiene and quality.
Cheers"
Awesome food great service definitely worth another visit... Paresh is very good and active person his personality to mach your restaurant 👍
"Excellent service and great food. Ambience is nice. courteous staff, manager’s suggestions were definitely worth it. Pasta were extremely delicious"
"Worst service ever! Avoid this restaurant at all costs. For my son's birthday, we decided to go to Sun 'n Sand's Aqua restaurant, thinking there is a semblance of class there. So wrong. The waiter kept answering us in Hindi when we spoke to him in English, even though there were foreigners dining there, so clearly he chose to speak in Hindi because we are Indian. Then, we asked him for starters listed on the menu. He said he had to check if the dish was available. He came back and first said it was not available. Then we asked if there were any starters in prawns not listed on the menu. He said he could give us Chinese starters. What is the point of going to a Continental restaurant and...read more"
"Food is good, service needs to majorly improve. Also it seems the ambience needs a proper uplift. For some reasons, waiters and service staff was completely switched off."
"I been to this place with my family for buffet dinner but sadly it was not at all how i expected.
* starters were good and served nice and warm. Welcome drinks were ok ok
* dinner menu was decent but then food was not that tasty as it should be or what I was hoping it to be..
* briyani was good very rich n full of flavours
* live counter for chat never got what I asked for and the pasta was horrible. Street side vendors make better pasta and use more cream and cheese!
Deserts were ok ok nothing to die for.. some times were too dry and gajar halwa was waste.
Sorry for being harsh but it was almost ₹2000 per head plus taxes which was wasted in fact I would like a refund and I would...read more"
This is one of my earliest memories in Bombay. And since then it's been a regular visit. Love the beach side vibe. Cleanliness just wins the heart at this place. Some amazing drinks they have to offer. I'm not a big fan of the food here. But it's the perfect place to get a drink and relax enjoying the sunset. Aqua is Definitely in my love list
The overall ambiance is nice but we were dissapointed with the service. The staff is not well equipped with knowledge of what is being served and we found a dead flie in the pasta.
"How does a chicken arrive in a veg pav bhaji ?? And that too in all the 3 plates we ordered.
Extremely disappointed with @aquasunandsand ... This is just not done!"
One of my favourite places for a serene dinner. Great array of food and love the kulchas here. Definitely worth multiple visits. The paneer gravy options are also great and some good starters on offer too
Very bad pizza no cheese in it at all and when said no cheese the lame excuse was it's melted already very bad service and all the more Cox of zomoto gold used
