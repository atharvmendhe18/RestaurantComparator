Review
"Food is good but service is too slow. I've had lunch with my team, we were frustrated by the service.
I would only recommend this place when you have plenty of time in this world."

"We have been there just to try this restaurant. Also this place is near to my work place. This place is divided in two sections 1. Ground floor &non AC section for local drinking people and 2. 1 St floor (ac section & family section).

We have reached there after 7 pm due to which we missed our happy hours. But this place is reasonable with respect to price. We have ordered fish finger and paneer in schezwan souce both the items were really good. I loved them both. Also service is their plus point. Service was also quick and staff was Co operative.

I highly recommend this place for family."
This place is very close to the L&T Business Park near Powai lake. The location isn't great but the restaurant is really nice. The food is one of the tastiest I've had. It's not very expensive also and though it is a resto bar.. it has a decent ambience for a perfect outing with friends.
Had multiple bad experiences with them. Food is highly ok and service is really pathetic. The staff is extremely rude and very unprofessional. Will never visit this place again.
"This place checks right for every single parameter that I have in my head. The food is delight and Ambience is perfect for an amazing getaway. You should totally visit it for trial once. You would return back and rightly so.

Thank me later for this advice. üëçüèº"
"Been there twice, both times for someone's treat. Food was good, especially cheese garlic naan! However, it isn't a place for non drinkers, non smokers and someone who thinks a bit about their health!"
"Average looking place, good for informal meals and for students wanting to just have a trip . Waiters are pretty helpful and service is decent .

Chef's special are must to be taken as all of them in Veg especially is good .The special soup might taste like hot n sour but is worth giving a try

Its pretty cheap and the food served is value for money .

No such outside disturbances and all will promote it for casual outings ."
Good place to dine out with your friends and family. A delight for Indian food lovers. Service is also quite good along with food quality. Ambience is decent as well.
One of those places which will never disappoint you - food is always flavourful and delicious! This is our go to restaurant for delivery! Yum
"Time taken to prepare food was little high, it can b little quick"
Too long to deliver the food. But worth the wait. Please sort your issues with Zomato online ordering..
"We visit this place often with our family. We take a corner booth and order most of the menu.
The starters are really good and the quantity is more than enough. Starter with mushroom and cheese and corn and cheese are the best and the chef's special here!"
"Such a horrible place. I called for my food at 1 pm. He said it would take 25 mins to get to me. Even after specifically mentioning the address properly and repeating it twice, the delivery guy went to the wrong house. It‚Äôs taken them 2 hours to deliver the food that was ordered at 1pm. When I called the guy at the restaurant to ask, he didn‚Äôt know where his delivery guy was either! Heights of incompetence! Never ordering from this place ever again.

P.S - my house is just 10 mins from the restaurant!"
"Great place if you have low to decent budget. Service is good, food is okay. Sizzling brownie too expensive.
Great Chinese. Ambience is good. Doesn't distract you too much, there's a TV here to keep your mind occupied.

If you're going in a large group of about 20-30 you can book a separated area on the first floor which has it's own music system. Dance, sing or do anything you want here. You're bound to find many IITians here. The area is a little secluded so it's difficult for first time to find it but otherwise it's a great place for a decent budget."
"We got to sit on 1st floor. Soups were delicious be it sweet corn or Manchow or hot and sour. We ordered really basic atarter such as crispy chicken, lollipop and chicken Tikka dry. In main tried this okay-ish butter chicken and good to go naan. After trying all this, then came biryani and it didn't disappoint."
"Appetite, this sound is hungry nice name Tuesday night we visit there 1st floor the ambiance is good with service also, n chicken lollypop in s/z dry not up to the mark n everything was well .."
"Beautiful place amazing food test staff is good
Dal khichdi tadka 5*
Asstoerd nveg platter and vargin pinacolda
Near l&t powai
Dayal Gariya @bunnu"
One of the best Dal khichadi I ever had. You have to try it. Order the tadka one. We also ate Lucknow dum biryani which was good but a little spicy. Can ‚Äòt comment on rest of the cuisines as I did not try it. Go and explore the place and experiment on ur taste buds!! :)
"Perfect weekendüç≤

Enjoyed Sundae ice-cream, nonveg platter and brownie at 'Appetite'

Its worth visiting here, and the food taste is really mouthwatering üòç"
There has been a change in the management which has reflected in their service n menu.The service and menu has changed for the good.Also do check out the services provided during the happy hours. With a variety of cocktails and mocktails this place is a must visit if your lookin for some delicious food with affordable prices.
I did not like the place much. The taste of food was good though but the service was really bad in terms of time and staff behaviour. Also this place is quite affordable
A must visit to try sea food or chicken.Their double cooked chicken and fish finger is very appetizing. The naan and the starters were also extremely delicious and mouthwatering.Service of the staff is great.I had a nice experience!!! Kudos!!
"Really good food, and I mean it - especially non-veggies would love it. But the only problem i experienced - service guys are little unresponsive, however, it's location makes the spot a favorite place to hang out after office.

Other best thing is liquor is cheap."
"This restaurant is a classic example of how to lose a customer ....

So I go to this restaurant very often and hence I thought let's start ordering food. Until then food quality was good. On time as well.

Today I ordered for just 2 dishes . First order was sent after an hour against a promise of 20 minutes.

Thankfully we did not open parcel. And almost after 30 minutes of delivery the owner himself calls and tells that the parcel is wrong . It's is for some other customer and out dishes are still in his restaurant

I agree to further delay but requested for freshly made stuff. Inspite of agreeing to the terms the restaurant provided double dried lollypop.

I just don't understand so...read more"
"Although I was not expecting a lot from the place, it didn't even live up to the least expectations I had from a Resto-Bar. The staff was so arrogant, the place was dirty, the food was shitty. One of my friends vomited right after we were done eating."
"We went during one of the weekends.. Place was not that crowded. We ordered directly main course as it was bit late. But due to our bad luck v recieved roti with hair in it. We complained and they changed the roti. But the real issue started when one of the waiter calling himself as manager came wid the bill. They charged us more saying we ordered(paneer kadhai) that was not in the menu,but he clearly suggested us to order that. When v cross questioned him,he started misbehaving , even wid the girls and started saying us to leave. They sincerely need counselling sessions for their staff on how to behave wid customers as v r paying for their average food. Go only if u dont care about...read more"
"Food - 3 /5
Ambiance - 2.5/5
Service - 1.5/5
Value for money - 2/5
Ahem ahem not good
Service is pathetic
Food ok
Ambiance ok
Long way to go....."
"Was disappointed. Did not stack upto the great reviews written about this place on zomato.
Had placed an order for Murgh Tawa, Rotis and Naan and the ETA provided was 40 mins.
Actual time of delivery was unfortunately 75 mins. Customer service was not very helpful (both the restaurant's and as usual Zomato customer service is hopeless). They just kept assuring that the order was on the way.

Anyway, coming to the important aspect.
Food quality : tasty but very oily and spicy
Pricing : reasonable when you compare restaurants of similar grade
Will I order again : maybe will give them another chance (just because of the reviews that I read on this page). Hope they prove my review wrong the...read more"
"So every thing went gud initially, as we are visiting this place from its inauguration. Food goes well always but staff sucks, they will misbehave,doesn't serve well. We went for smoke break, they took our left overs , when argued for same, they returned the same used plate(considered a crime in food industry), We never know what has been given to us back. Guys bad service, very bad, do not visit(sply withur corporate's)"
"Veg lemon pepper soup (3.5/5) was very different and good to try, but a little too peppery in some places, and i would've liked the taste of lemon to be a bit stronger. Nevertheless, very unique flavour, which i quite enjoyed!

Paneer hot dragon dry (4/5), as the name suggests was very very hot (spicy), and well made. The paneer was exceptionally soft, almost like butter - loved it!

Paneer bhurji (4/5) - again an exceptionally well made dish, with very home style flavours, low on spices and oil but rich in taste! Very delectable indeed, must try!

Butter garlic naan (3/5) was lacking butter and was quite dry, but it tasted okayish.

Service (3/5): quite slow, we spent almost half an...read more"
"So i went to this place after a long day and it was an absolutely correct decision of choosing the place.
The food is really delicious.
We ordered butter chicken paneer in pesto sauce mangolian paneer and a Chinese chefs special rice. All of it was really good. The flavours were amazing and the food was served hot!
The staff is good polite and decent too.

The food and drinks both are very economically priced.

Must visit!!"
"This was my first and last time that I went to this hotel. Extremely poor service, too much delays in everything. Taste was also not good. Obvious things that should be included during the meals need to be asked for."
A decent and a low budget place to get some drinks. Food prepration looked perfect to me with a mix blend of spices that blooms a very good taste in food. Service is also very good. We had a lot of drinks and starters at amazingly low prices. A very good place it is.
The place is little small. The food is good. Very near to the L&T Powai. It gets crowded during lunch so u may have to suffer with a noisy atmosphere inside the restro. Service is good. One should sure give it a try.
"Nice place..we cant imagine such a lovely restaurant near to L&T powai...definitely you will be amazed with menu..almost all types of regular food items are available....dont miss dhal kichdi,mock tails,the best place to go wd even family...nice management...so co operative
..Last but not least go wd your Id cards...yup...discounts!!!"
"Hi had been there with fly nice calm place. Had ordered chicken manchow soup, drink fruit punch, starters chicken crispy which was good and nice quantity for 3 people and mutton pepper tawa which is very delicious and soft and main course butter nan and ghost do plaza value for money must go place."
"Visited it last nite...
Must try the Jade Soup..the palak n chicken combination recipe is unique and super yum...!!
The staff is friendly n courteous....they recommended the Chicken Tikka biryani....n wow!!was I pleased..! Loved it...One of the bestest I hv had.
Drinks I had a Long island and It was good..
The bombay duck fry was a great starter along wid it.
Would definately be back for the food and the unique menu..!!

"When you want to booze that too in a cheap rate then this place is for you..
Place is located just opposite to L&T gate..

Ambiance is good for Non AC compartment..but for AC one its totally different and beautiful.. you can visit with your family..
Service is far better, waiters are very warm and treat you well and dressed properly..

Food quality is good. As far as taste concern it is not that good but few dishes are very brilliant. I only had starters here so I dnt want to comment on main course.
But yes Starters are good and rates are average.. you can try many of them.
They also give u complimentary ( Chakna).

"A place where good ambience and good food meets value for money. We went to Appetite on a weekday as a group of 5. There was no rush because it was a weekday.

I'll start with the ambience. I was surprised by the ambience since good ambience is generally a rare sight in budget restaurants. The place was lit up properly (Dim yet not too dim) and it seemed spacious enough. Hygiene was on par as well.

Coming to the food, I was satisfied with both the quantity and quality of food. Murgh musellam is definitely worth a try. The alcohol here is cheap as well comparatively. The service was also quite fast (maybe because the crowd was less).

So I easily say I was quite satisfied with Appetite in...read more"
"Worst resto,overly priced rather the service is 0/5, inspite of telling 10% discount will b offered ,no discount given and the waiter told me ki "" apko bolna chaiye tha na discount do"" i mean its d policy to gve 10% discount nd u want me to tell u.....dnt visit guys plz...food served is coldd"
"I'm sure you have heard of the saying 'Never judge a book by it's cover' and that's all I want you to remember when you visit this place.

It is a little difficult to find and may look a little shady but that initial impression will vanish as soon as you get inside. This place is divided into non-A/C and A/C seating and I've always gone to the the A/C seating area on the first floor. The ambiance of the place is really classy and can give a tough competition to a lot of restaurants especially if you factor in the prices. The staff is really courteous and well-trained but the service is a tad slow.

Coming to the food, their menu is spread wide across Indian and Chinese cuisines and to be...read more"
"It was an office party that got me to this place. Note:- Google maps gives you aam incorrect direction and this place is a little hard to find. It is located opposite L&T and the flyover covers it.
As for the food, everything from Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Lollipop to Dum Biryani was great. The waiters were polite. All and All a good restaurant, but only for friends, colleagues etc. for Family, I would recommend take-out (nothing related to the management but mostly due to the crowd)"
"Reached here after a tiresome drive and was wanting to eat as much as possible. But the food wasn't as good. Ordered veg manchurian, noodles and pot rice. The dishes, though hot, tasted different. I guess this is due to the same sauces being used for veg and non-veg dishes. Ambiance and service were good but the more important TASTE is not so profound."
"V had visited this place to celebrate a friend's bdae ND I must say that the service is very slow n the food just didn't met my expectations according to their review. Had ordered sizzling chicken which tasted like chicken manchurian but okk. Murg handi was not upto the mark as it didn't taste like d dish which I have tried in many restaurants, contained a normal homemade chicken taste. Salt was less in dal n chicken. Need to improve guyzz. N also the waiters need to improve their behavior as they are laughing teasingly on while d guests are taking pics or eating."
"I am rewriting my review as last few visits have changed my view of things.First of all the service is pathetic ,if you are planning to go for lunch make sure you have 2.5 hours of lunch break.They cannot handle large groups I think even 4 people were difficult for them.Even after noting orders on system there is high possibility they will not bring the order and blame it on you. The waiters don't behave properly and they spill food ,if you ask for something you will have to repeat 3 times after which you can hope to get things.I remember when the restro was opened things were different the owner arrived and visited us but now it seems no one cares.Not going to visit again."
"Food quality is good in comparision to Sea Land. Chicken starter and main course items are good. If you are a vegiterian then its not a good choice. Try Ghari Chicken, it is good."
"Good food, good staff... Great place to chill with friends, colleagues after a long or short tiring day... Only thing missing, they should also have happy hours..."
"While the place is good for a get together of 10-15 people, the food and the service is not up to the mark. Almost all the non veg dishes were extra spicy & the mutton could not be differentiated from a piece of rubber. On bringing this to the notice of the staff, the comment we got was that no one else is complaining so it should be fine. Good place to take people who don't matter much to you as it provides a decent ambience without a huge pinch to the pocket."
This place is a bliss for people working in L&T business park. For me its the only place near my office serving good food at a reasonable cost.Been there many times on lunch and tried several items from their menu.My experience was never disappointing.Surmai tava fry and paneer Chinese starters are some of my recommendations
"Writing a review after quite a long time. And i have just finished ordering some dishes from appetite. Though i have never visited this place but i am a regular ordering bird., becuase our company is located quite near to the restaurant, ie in SEEPZ.. My favourites are chicken tandoori, murgh reshmi kabab, paneer hot garlic dry. When it comes to biryani..murgh hyderabadi biryani has no match. Almost all dishes are delicious and cooked appropriately. Food is not too much spicy. Thinking of visiting this place some time."
"Came here for a big meetup! The place is like a normal family diner .. With clean and soothing ambience and courteous staff.
Food : what taste and variety!! YummüíÉ
Paneer items,noodles,chicken, spring rolls..every damn thing was delicious. Must visit if craving for delicious starters!"
"While the staff was courteous enough, I have a bone to pick with the chefs over the food. Really oily food, there was gravy in everything, and little meat. Also, out of 3 dishes, 1 was changed because they didn't have what we ordered, and 1 was completely different from what was ordered."
"The place is good in ambiance and atmosphere. serving is loose, it takes a lot of time to get the food after ordering though staff is good.food is awesome be it be yummy starters, tasty meal or delicious deserts.Drinks cocktails and mocktails are great.A place that everyone can afford."
"A good place to have food, this restaurant scores high on the quality as well as quantity, which very few do. Located near L&T, it houses a bar at the ground floor and an air-conditioned restaurant on the first floor. Though the place is small, it packs a punch. The menu is overwhelming and has some delectable preparations in both Indian and Chinese sections. Chicken chilly oyster is particularly good. The drinks menu is good as well. Service is good and quicker w.r.t to other similar restaurants. Overall this place is worth visiting for a sumptuous lunch or dinner. 
Did I mention.. this place has great value for money !!"
"Ordered the Zafran Chicken lucknavi biryani.. it wasn't bad but it was not the name suggested. Nothing lucknavi about it so disappointed with what we expected.
We have different varieties of biryani in India as we have different spice culture in our diverse country... I wouldnt put curry leaves in amritsari chhole.. you get it ?"
"This place is in quite a an indecent neighbourhood so after arriving there we were a bit skeptical of the quality, but the food and drinks were brilliant. The portion in each dish was plenty as well. Service was sweet. Decent ambience.
Why should you go there? Value for money"

--------------------
We were hunting for a restaurant near Powai which serves Murg Mussalam. After finding good reviews in zomato we planned to visit this place. We ordered Sizzling Veg and Paneer Hot Dragon Dry for starters. I expected the Paneer Hot Dragon Dry to be spicier but overall it tasted good. Sizzling Veg was super delicious. Foods were plenty in quantity and the service was really good. My stomach was more than half-filled even before tasting the Murg Mussalam. It was my first try to Murg Mussalam and I liked it. My friend also relished Paneer Lahori (was made spicier on his request) along with butter roti.

"Worst experience! Service is just horrible. I had to wait for more than 45mins before cancelling the order.
Save your time and try some other place."
"Pathetic experience. We are still at restaurant and irs been 40 mins since we placed order. No starters served. People adjacent to our table came after us and got their order already.
We came first time to try based on zomato rating. Regretting! Zero rating. No service quality"
Cost for 2 is not true if you r hard drinker.. But for such place u can afford tht much amount from ur purse. Food was so cheap n too tasty.. Veg crispy best in these area. Liquor was bit expensive service was very fast
"First things first, zomato has got it wrong. This place does not have live music (Infact, it never had) Since this place is close to my office, I have been here n no of times. Everytime, the food was awesome. Right from their naams, till vegetables till biryani and other items, nothing really disappoints. The only thing that can make you irate is they already take around 20-25 mins to serve you food. However the staff is very good. If you call their no and place your order and tell them that you'll be there in sometime, they'll prepare your food and keep a table ready for you which is very helpful for people who work around d this place. Also, the rates is pocket friendly. A must visit."
"I like this place very much for their good service and especially for there spicy and delicious food items.
We ordered 2 veg starter paneer hot dragon dry and veg sizzlings both are spicy and very tasty.
In main course murga musallam that also very delicious... overall worth place to have dinner."
"A surprisingly good place with great, affordable food! Although the outer ambience puts you off initially, the inner ambience is good. Due to its off-road location, its generally free from crowds. The food comes in normal quantity; we were four people, and were fully statisfied with the chef's special paneer starters, and the main course consisting of 4 cheese garlic naans, and two sabzi dishes (paneer patiala and veg kadai). Paneer patiala was good, and veg kadai was normal. We topped it off with casatta for desert. The service is good here. The total bill came around 1000 rupees, and they do have IITB student discount. This place is worth a second visit!"
"our frequent new destination near iit powai for dinner once a week..mutton biryani is really special...ghar ka murg is good for curry...overall restaurant is cheaper, easy to locate with clean ambience...they should do something about ventilation and noise reduction when crowded...the pan shop beneath it serves good quality pan...rarely it happens that waiters mismatch the order..lol"
This is the place where you can have proper dinner along with drinks without feeling uncomfortable. Nice place for dinner with friends. Service is little poor but the taste is awesome..Paramita Haldar Ashish Gautam Rahul Ankush Nagulwar Khagesh Kumar read more
"Decent place with awesome food - we had murg mussalum, mutton sukka and Mumbai mirchi tikka - everything was awesome. Alcohol rates are also decent.
Didn't try and fish dish as waiter said that they don't have it fresh and service is a bit slow. Over all good place to have nice dinner.
Definitely murg mussalum burrrrppssss!!!"
Mumbai mirchi kebab is excellent. Mutton sukha was also very good. Murgh mussalam was the dish of the day. Alcohol is very reasonable. Service is a bit slow.
"My friends at office suggested we try some different place for buffet so we decided to have lunch here. Their non-vegetarian buffet is priced at ‚Çπ320 and vegetarian buffet is for ‚Çπ270.

The starters in both veg and non-veg were limited given that they are priced so less. Non-veg buffet had one Chinese starter and one north Indian starter and the same goes for vegetarian only difference being that chicken was replaced with paneer and the taste was also not that great. The main course had two chicken curries and steam rice and dal, roti of your choice. The dessert was one scoop of chocolate ice-cream. All the dishes tasted strictly okay! They need to offer more variety in starters and...read more"
"Went here yesterday to grab some booze and some snacks with my cousin. The location isn't all that spectacular. We had to face a lot of loud office goers. However the food was OK. Nothing special. We ordered fish fingers, chicken black bean, some masala papads. Strictly ok. However the chicken pot rice was simply superb. May visit again."
"The rating is solely for the taste of the foods. The food was delicious.. Service though was a tad bit slow. We opted for lunch buffet. The items were limited, however balanced for the price it demanded. The soup was bad. Starters (which the waiter wasn't aware that it was present)were awesum and so was the main course. Ice cream was great. Atmosphere/ambience so so. Place was congusted. Overall a great resto-bar to visit with ur friends.."
"Ambience is at best average. Good to takeaway. Starters are good. Try the kebabs, they're good value for money. Avoid late nights. Office area"
The food was appetizing and toothsome. The ambience of the restaurant is soothing. In veg I had paneer starters which I loved. For non veg lovers the prawn koliwada is a must. Pinacoloda was d best mocktail. The service is also commendable
"By and far, I had my best meal in Mumbai at Appetite. Firstly, I felt lucky to get a big table reserved at the last moment on Christmas Eve. The restaurant is pretty spacious and has a good D√©cor.
The mocktails were decent but the Pina Colada was pretty good.
Amongst starters each of the three dishes ‚Äì Tandoori Non Veg platter, Chicken Hot Dragon and Chicken wontons were splendid.
The main course was even better. Murgh Peshawari, egg coated chicken in tomato based thick gravy absolutely stole the show. Chicken Chilly oyster sauce and with Chilly garlic noodles were a perfect Pan Asian closure to the meal. The only disappointing thing was the Dal Makhni. Still no regerts as I...read more"
"An excellent resto-bar to have in the neighbourhood. The variety in cuisine and quality of food across the board is impressive and matches up to any fine dining restaurant in the city. Have ordered food from here on multiple occasions, including for as many as 20 people on occasions such as parties at home. Prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly and Arjun, the owner of the place, is personally attentive to the needs of patrons. Do check this place out!"
You get to know what is hunger when you get stuck in a meeting way too long. In that pang of hunger you work faster than Google Maps and locate an eatery which you might have ignored otherwise. This shy little space will surprise you a whole lot deal. The ambience is good and the food is even better! Loved their Chicken Hot Dragon and Fruit punch! Do locate it! ;)
"Few days back i tasted tandoori chicken from this place ...when visited a friends place ..i was impressed ..plus i checked good reviews ..

Today while on walk, i reached here ..and decided to get my dinner from here. Got chicken tadka and half tandoori packed. Taste n quantity was good. It was hot, fresh and right amount of spices were there. Prices r average. I guess it was value for money.

While waiting for my order, while sitting, i noticed place interiors were good from a bar point of view. Staff was friendly.

I'll defiantly come here for drinks sometime. Booze rate seemed reasonable, as expected from this place."
This place is a one minute walk away from my home. The delicious food and the wallet friendly prices make me a frequent customer here. The service and the ambience should be improved though.
"Have been there for buffet lunch, good menu & food too is good also not at all heavy on pocket. Excellent service, very polite & helpful staff."
"Last week I had visited this place. I was indeed surprised to know that there's this restaurant in a city like Mumbai which serves lunch buffet and that too at an extremely affordable pricing.

Rs 220 for Veg and Rs 270 for Non Veg that too all inclusive of taxes. WOW!

To add more, the spread was great keeping the pricepoint in consideration. 

1 soup ( veg and Non veg)
2 starters ( Veg and Non veg)
2 Gravey Item (Veg and Non veg)
Dal fry and steamed rice
Ice cream

The food is nice over here but the service is not good. Have visited this place so many times but everytimes the waiters sucks a big time. I would prefer you to try achaari alo as a starter at this place. Can have better service.

Comparing other places the beverages are cheap too. Hospitality given s very nice always. Good going appetite! üòÄ"
"Awesome kebabs and u can find variety of cuisines if u r bored of regular curries.
Taste can be rated as 5
Didnt like the biryani
Rated low for service or else it cud have fetched 4

On our  2nd visit we had chicken sukha,chicken rozali and veg sizzling
Service was better this time"
Love the pepper chicken..n methi kofta. Ambience is vry good...home delivery tkes time...but good quality food at good rates. Worth it!!! Loved it!!
"Visited there for a lunch buffet and 2 mocktails (as per groupon offer)..They don't have too much varieties on buffet menu but taste is very good and negotiable considering value for money..The mocktails were good but they didn't provide us the options to choose from. the only thing I didn't like was the AC section was dealt with only two waiters, they were efficient enough but still we had to wait too much for getting their attention. the management should take care of that..."
