wrong order send me its order paneer hydrbadi biryani sent me chicken hyderabadi biryani

there lots of gravy and less paneer.
It was sweet like a dessert had to throw it in the dustbin. Such a disaster.
Testless west of money
did not recieve rotis. This is the biggest mistake I made by choosing zomato
