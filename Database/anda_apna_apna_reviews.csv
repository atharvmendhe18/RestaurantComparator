"I had such high expectations from this Andaaz Apna Apna place cos I've ordered omelette pav a few times and it's been exceptional.

So today like a wise guy I ordered masala bhurji and egg rice.

it was terrible. the masala bhurji was a front shop for (put more butter, that makes everything tasty) some food. the egg rice was terrible too in a half hearted attempt at making a Chinese vinegar soya chilly fried rice and egg in it. yuck. so terrible that I can bet the cooks never eat here.

these two dishes must be banned from civilian use and the military must use them as torture devices for the unworthy tippers of Zomato jail."

"once upon a time, I ate daily from here. yesterday and the last time I ordered from here, the same two dishes, the maggi was so smelly. almost foul smell and the omlette was rubbery, chewy with no taste. there was no masala in masala omlettee. very disappointed"
aluminium foil found in food. Hazardous way of cooking and packaging.
