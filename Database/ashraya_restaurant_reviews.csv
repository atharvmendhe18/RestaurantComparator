"Good service ,sean great food great ambience.we had order for veg Kolhapuri and veg Schezwan rice it was amazing..i ll visit again and again..."
"I have seen the kitchen of ashraya restaurant and it's not good on hygiene. That's why 2 rating. Dosa is the only average dish you get here, rest are not worth trying. People mostly come here for a quick bite. I have also tried pav bhaji here, which I did not liked."
"It is situated around shivaji park, it is a non air conditioned restaurant very typical to the 90's restaurant which had not upgraded with time. It's perfectly fine not upgrade the ambience to have that old world charm and also unique experience for it's patrons but for that you need to have a speciality in a specific cuisine or taste that is excellent, for eg Madras Cafe, Ram Ashray, Mysore Cafe, Bagdadi and the list can continue with such iconic eataries, but Ashray is not like the one's mentioned before. It is a good restaurant, but nothing extra ordinary and the prices are also expensive. A normal plate of idli costs you for 55 and a filter coffee around 25. I am sure you can get...read more"
Service was good. But I'll suggest to go for roadside thelas for much more great taste & spicy pav bhaji in less than ₹50/- instead of Birjus less spicy pav bhaji of ₹120/-
"decent place with quick service
high on price
nthng spl for damages on ur pocket!!!!!
tasty food though..
this restaurant should be the last resort....try out other restaurant of same category and giving out better."
"Ashraya Restaurant is a non air conditioned hotel at L J Road with a limited seating capacity.

You get quality South Indian dishes over here and they also serve vegetarian punjabi food over here. The Idli-Dosa-Vada and tea-Coffee are the fast moving items here.

We have tried the Malai Kofta with Tandoori Roti. The Malai Kofta was just above average. We also tried the Veg Hyderabadi Biryani.

They also have a home delivery facility in the nearby neighborhood.

The servers need to be told not to put their fingers inside the steel water glasses :("
"Ordered masala uttapam...got ""burnt"" masala uttapam...upon asking, got a reply that we prepare like this.
One of the pathetic service and most ignored thing in entire hotel is customer....attitude of waiters is as if hotel is paying customers to eat...."
"Just ordered panir kolhapuri biryani worth rupies 150 but they made me pay 190 RS even though its 150 RS written on bill
Worst restaurant service ever"
"Excellent thali, especially the dal. Great job. Very clean ambience and professional yet friendly service. Inexpensive at the same time. Quantity is also sufficient. A must try place."
"Average place to visit with friends for quick lunch and snacks. South Indian snack items are good. Main course is average.
Ambience - avg
Food - avg
Service - avg"
"The staff is very hard working here. You get typical Udipi type food at some more cost. This is a Non AC restaurant at the roadside serving snacks, Chinese, north indian & desserts."
"We ended up stumbling here at 11.30 pm.
Its your regular corner non ac restaurant.
The service was fast except for the sandwich which took around 35 minutes to arrive.
Dal fry,paneer makhanwala and veg handi were surprisingly tasty.
Naans and rotis were good.
The veg cheese grill sandwich was a huge disappointment.
The sandwich solely tasted of butter and did not look grilled at all.
They carry packaged ice creams.
I found their pricing expensive for the ambience of the place."
"It's a good restaurant, from my childhood till now I visit here every now and then but now I try to explore other restaurants too and find this one little out dated as compared to its competitor Shobha its on the back foot. Food was great earlier but now not that good but still a good option to hang out with family on tight budget since it is pocket friendly."
Ashraya good enough for some kine of vegetarian dishes..flavours are very good to be honest. Sometimes the flavour is not maintained but still tastes well so I love it
"This place is located on the main road near Shivaji Park and is ideal to grab a quick snack/meal. Quick service, decent food (especially their Pav Bhaji) and reasonable prices. Nothing fancy, just a simple no fuss vegetarian restraunt."
"I went for lunch with my friend in here. Not a good place to visit. The place is darkest in afternoon like they have electricity Shortage or something. The service as well is not good. you have to tell them twice for everything you order. like they run the resto just for the sake of it in afternoon. The food isn't worthy . Ordered one paneer gravy which was tasteless and more like a soup. Hope they change the way they are running the resto, soon."
"This is a very well known place in thw vicinity for veggie lovers... its a regular reataurant serving south indian to punjabi and so on... While everything is good and i can vouch for almost every dish i have tried here, personally my favourite is their thalis... They hav like a regular thali a punjabi thali n a special thali... punjabi n special are my favourites though... both have the same things served generally just that Special thali quantity is more as compared to punjabi. So this thali comes with 3 veggies a dal dahi a sweet roti/puri/chapati raita papad pulav/jeera rice. U can order for extra rotis which is obviousky charged extra . But to me the quantity is juat fine for 2 ppl....read more"
"Ashray is that restaurant where you can go when you don't have anything to eat at home and do not want to spend a lot of money. I personally like the pav bhaji here, which is quite famous locally. Everything else is just average."
"Went for lunch to this place yesterday. A very average vegetarian restaurant. Located strategically at a junction of two roads, this place is always decently crowded. The food tasted good, rotis were served fresh and the quantity they served was value for money."
"In the world of instagrammed foods and Michelin chefs, Ashraya is the proverbial 'le domestique', which satisfies the objective of putting grub in your stomach.
Located on the main Road near shivaji park and sitladevi temple, ideal location if you wanna have a hot cup of tea / cold drink / snacks ( dosa, pav bhaji) or a quick dinner ( no frills pav bhaji / Indian Chinese )
USP - no frills, quick service . Ideal for meeting a business acquaintance or a super quick lunch /snack."
Nothing so great about the place...ONly reason one could find is a bit cheaper food. Food quality is average and so is the timing. Nothing exceptional
"dont even try.

the place is very old and the quality has gone low.

the dosas are soggy and the white chutney was watery. 

The pav bhaji has no taste."
"Found an insect in Cheese biryani. On pointing out, waiter said it must have dropped on the way out of the kitchen. Clearly, it was cooked with the food. Disgusting."
"A very cozy place when you just don't want to cook /eat at home... Pavbhaji is good.. Dosa, Mysore masala dosa, tomato omlet n dahi wada is good... Very economical... Waiters n cleanliness is ok"
"Nice food
Decent crowd
The waiters are not trained properly eg.they wont give u the tray of sauces when h order a soup. U will have to ask for it.
Thats the only small drawback
Else the place is nice"
"This is the go to place when you don't have anything at home and don't want to think too much about food. Cos Ashray equals Pav Bhaji! I have had that and probably the Masala Papad, though I am not sure. Anyway, the place itself is a typical cosmopolitan Bambaiya joint (yeah lets just make it a thing, for MUMBAI'S sake! A place where the best dish is the Masala Dosa or Pav Bhaji and the Hot and Sour soup isn't the worst either!)
So that's the place this is. You wouldn't go there and sit in this age but it's always on your take away list. The service is damn fast!
So next time you plan on eating cheap and palatable food from a place which has a hassle free menu, Ashray is your place...read more"
Situated at shivaji park this place serves u ordinary food or snack found in another hotels around I will suggest to go for dosa or medu wada or idli when having food here they are really fresh taste better than other things reasonable place
Ashrya is like second home food destination .. Along with the food the best thing to be highlighted is friendly and quick service..if u want to have quick bite and rush somewhere.. This is the place where u should be..
"When we enter in this restaurant, we see the statue of Shirdi SaiNath. The statue makes the atmosphere pleasant. I've tasted all South Indian items here like idli, vada sambar & different types of dosas, uttappas. But my personal favourite is Pav Bhaji. It's spicy & having it's own different flavour. This is a nice place for Pav Bhaji lovers. You may try the Thali served here. I like the Veg Kofta, Chhole & Daal served in Thali. Quick service, nice staff."
Been here....!!! Reasonable place....!!!! Recently renovated but still foods the same....!!!! Not happy with food...!!!!! But no harm......!!!!! Good eat food for just sakeof eating it.....!!!!
Many people say this place was famous long back but the food didn't impress me at all. It is very ordinary. There are many good options to try near this area compared to Ashraya. Pls choose to go to gypsy or Aaswad or Trupti or Trofima for that matter
"Very ordinary restaurant with options in South Indian, North Indian, Chinese cuisines and snacks. You would find people mostly from lower middle class thronging this place at wee lunch and dinner hours. Oil used for the cooking is of very low quality and leaves a coloured residue after you finish your meal, I find it very dirty.! Nevertheless, staff is good and possess some basic manners to deal with the customers. All in all, a below average restaurant with below average food."
"A very regular, Udipi type restaurant, supposed to be known for their pav bhaji.. I honestly found the pav bhaji strictly OK.. They had good batata wadas, but off late even those didn't seem to taste the same. In an area like shivaji park, where there's so much competition among the upcoming eateries, the once promising ashraya might find it difficult to survive."
A good place for the price. Outside our lane at the heart of Shivaji Park .. Quick and prompt service. Great for South Indian snacks and Pav bhaji
"Food is ok but there service is pathetic, we even had to ask for water, which is served as basic courtesy, can improve on their service as there is huge scope."
"Always had them home delivered the snacks. Good sambar and idlis, medu wada but the best is onion uttappa. Yummy, cheap and fulfilling."
"One of the worst places I have ever been . The decor was bad they even don't have proper lights for total bright reastaurnt the food was ok but there is an open kitchen and after seeing it u wont come again . The waiters are not polite and coordial . Not even worth pay for dish . The crowd in the restaurant is also not good .
So visit at your own risk"
"This place opens up pretty early and that’s their only saving grace. The idli, dosas and vadas are very ordinary and as are their other offerings such as misal, pav bhaji etc. I’ve never dared to go beyond the snacks and have invariably suffered a heartburn because of the sort of oil they use."
"Idali, medu wada and dosa etc..... is the best.... pav bhaji, sandwich and thali is ok tyap... dont try vrg. jaipuri and any chinese..... service is so so.... home delivery you need lost of peasant....."
