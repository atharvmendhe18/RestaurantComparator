Review
"Overall Experience : 4/5
Had ordered 2 things
Chicken Rajoli Kebab : 5/5 (Awesome taste and perfectly cooked with fine flavours)
Chicken Green Thai Curry: 3.5/5 (Not the authentic one, more like a desi version of thai curry but taste was good)

Other reviews : Ambience is good, washroom is well maintained, the only negative point was that the order takes too long to come. On an average 20 mins for one order to get ready."
"This place is renovated and renamed as SPICE AFFAIR but is still known as Akshaya
It's usually crowded at evening and the service is bit slow
I tried
‚úì veg manchow soup : the taste was good and it was enough in portion
rating 4.5/5
‚úìchicken chilly garlic : nothing new it was similar to chicken chilly.. taste was okish
rating 3/5
‚úì bombil chilly : taste was good but the fish was not fresh which gave it a fishy smell
rating 4/5
‚úì chicken Hyderabadi briyani : recommended
rating 4.5/5"
Akshaya restaurant located Parel. Is is a family restaurant. Ambience is very good and clean. Staff is very friendly. And good amount of privacy is provided here. Service is fast well enough. Recommended dish from my side is chicken tandoori ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Even though this restaurant is close to my place i never been there before, it was my first visit with my wife as we plan just to hangout after hectic day spend. Due to weekend evening it was almost full & crowded, still the manager arranged seats for us. Staff was courteous & helpful. Ambience was cool, but we found little congested.
We order Chicken Manchow Soup,Chicken Lollypop, Chicken Biryani.
Food quality was excellent & delicious. Must try Chicken Biryani. We both really enjoyed our meal. Cost wise its average, pocket friendly.
Highly recommended."
"This is a bidget friendly Bar & Restro.

You might like this because of the food they have and the way they serve it.
Chicken Biryani, Butter chicken and Lollipop though it sound so casual but they are delicious trust me.

Liquor are served in different different flasks as if we are having food in a chem Lab :p

Food 4/5
Ambience 3/5"
Best food I have had in a while and the customer service is awesome. Has good infrastructure as well. Butter chicken and chicken drumsticks a must try if you are non vegetarian. I tried this place with my sister and she is a vegetarian. She also liked the place very much. We will visit again whenever we are in the area.
Restaurant and Bar. But a A nice ambience of one could expect. The dishes are good. Must try chicken drumsticks. That one of the best which they have got in tandoor. Even Paneer Lasooni Kebab is good. Delicious #LiveFoodie..
"The best place to hang out with very chill old school ambiance around Parel village. The staff is very friendly and safety for women is really not an issue. The area is bustling even at night being near hospitals.

Definitely try the Butter chicken with beer."
"You would get The Best chicken tandoori in town hereüòã Juicy and tasty!!
This restaurant is the best and pocket friendly place for food and booze."
"This is one of the good bar and restaurants in Lalbaug, Parel area of Mumbai. I have visited it many times when I lived in Lalbaug. The food quality especially the Thai rice is awesome. Chinese cuisine is nice too. Good place to visit during IPL season if you wish to have drinks along with good food while watching cricket on large projector screen."
This is a good restaurant for everyday decent cheap food. Fast delivery and a variety of Mughlai and Chinese food. In Parel easily accessible and decent place to sit üòÅüòç
"This is both a family restaurant and a permit room next to city towers in Parel.
We ordered a Manchurian Rice , Egg Masala , veg manchurian gravy ,Roti's and a vegetable Hand as well .Its ambience is that of a bar .
The crowd usually is a mic of advertising folks who come here for lunch .Service is good"
Waiters got their own swag....they ask for tip describing number of hours we sit there. Food is decent...service is good...but unacceptable attitude of waiter who ask 100 as tip...really?? Who does that??
"Akshaya...had ordered alishan kabab...tandoori paneer.. tandoori mushrooms....amazing amazing amazing...
Economical...fresh...staff taking order..was also helpful....qty and quality.. amazing"
I went here to taste biryani and I ordered Chicken Tikka Biryani and it was delicious as I expected. It's chicken was so soft and tasty and we'll grilled too.
Very frequent visitor...pocket frndly..a nice place to hangout out with frnds after a hectic work day...watching live cricket matches and having one or two drinks..they serve u unlimited complimentary snacks with ur drinküòâ..food is decent..suggestions chcken tandoori and mutton hyderabadi.
Worst management ever... U have to shift the tables now n then... Absolute disrespect for the customers.. No service at all... All you have to do is adjust and can not enjoy your booze...
"Stepped in here as we were passing by. We had very basic options such as Manchurian and Hakka noodles. Very average place in terms of the food as well as the decor. However, considering the prices, one cannot really be too fastidious about the ambience or the quality of food"
"The chicken tandoori you get here is the best tandoori you'd ever eat.
Everything has a decent taste.
The service is slow.
But what comes after is just amazing."
"Best butter chicken in town! The crispy chicken is also great! It might not come across as the best place to eat, but trust me the food is good. Butter chicken here is a must have!"
"If you are in parel area, this is the only decent place where you can go and chill. Good ambience but poor service. Very small place compared to other restaurants. They have big screen for matchday.

Service:1.5
Food:3
Ambience:4"
"A must have - tandoori chicken
Although not all Chinese starters are good but over all chinese food is good.
Chicken biryani is also worth trying."
"Decent food. Nothing really wonderful if your looking for a foodie's delight.
Cool place to hangout with friends while sipping whisky.
If you are hungry, try Dal Khichdi with Fish. (Seperate dishes coz fish is not always available, specially surmai)
Chicken biryani is also on the recommendations list.
For normal chicken gravy, order anything to get a similar sort of dish."
"If you're planning to order from this restaurant, then please don't. You can order it from somewhere else. This place made me wait for my dinner for more than 1 hour just because the order got misplaced. And I stay just 10 mins walking distance from this restaurant. And no one likes to wait for dinner for more than one and a half hour"
"The place which you can bank upon to serve you quick food and booze around the Parel office area.
Cheap and simple place to hang out after a long day at work.
Food is decent and serves all kind of alcohol.
If you love pets, their German Shepherd is always around."
"Parel Corporates!!! If you are at work and wanna order some good regular indo-chinese food, or say, wanna have a quick Drink hour with your colleagues, This is the place for you. 
PS : This place is in Parel (near Lalbaug or Currey Road stn), not Lower Parel.

People who love spending a lot, can stay away. Lower Parel has got Lounges for you, as you would never land on any restaurant that says - 'Cost for 2 - Below 2000' :-p

Let's begin the Menu-Journey for Akshaya....

Soups - 6/10
(I Love Soups. And a 6 rating is not bad, but nothing extra ordinary though. )
Tom Kha and Spice Miso Broth Soup are my suggestions.

Omlette lovers - Please try the Chicken Cheese Omlette Sandwich. Its...read more"
"Most pathetic tandoori ever tasted , and thrown away ! It was boiled chicken and then it was grilled ! I mean how disgusting can this get on the name of North Indian , do u even know what is North Indian food ??? Coloured , wet and here is ur tandoori chicken !!"
"I was a regular at this place for quite good time. I was in love with the food they served and also ordered many times from here. Today I went there very excitingly after very long and ordered food but surprisingly the food taste had gone down drastically. I'm still a big fan of yours, request toh guys to improve or get back that old taste which we always liked"
"One of the best restaurants in Parel. 
Good service , good food, good ambiance.
Very sophisticated place and can staff very friendly. 
Will definitely visit again."
"Had been to Akshaya with office colleagues on a Friday night for a couple of drinks followed by dinner. The food served is good and treat for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. We tried the starters like chicken crispy, chicken chilly and panner pakoda, which were quite nicely made and tastes good. Even the service is excellent. Overall a good experience to have food here, unlike most Bar restaurants.

Ambience - 3/5

Service - 3.5/5
Value for money - 4/5

Don't be surprised if you're greeted by a German Shepherd at the doorstep, its the owners dog and quite friendly too.
P.S : The dog's name is Bruno ;)"
"Oh !! this was just a minute away from where I am and had never visited Akshaya .
Probably cause there a a Hugh and scary German Shepard Guarding just near the main entrance or i always thought this would be another one of those Joints where you have the regulars for Drinks and Chakna.
But the Butter Chicken Surprise me .. It was YUM 
some good starters in veg which can go well with your drinks if you wish too ..
Egg Pakoda / Paneer Chilly / Chicken 65 / Aloo Chaat ( spicy )
The Dal Khichdi ( Tadka ) is awesome ... Must try or order of you staying near by .
Bunk The chinese mains..
Instead try the Chicken Kheema Butter Butter Paratha - its spicy and awesome .
and The Chilly garlic Naan -...read more"
"One of the eateries near my workplace which I frequently visit post-office hours on impromptu plans. Nothing great about the ambience, but the most striking thing is the prompt and quick service of beverages at very reasonable cost. The Chicken starters are delightful, especially Chicken Chilli and Chicken Crispy. Even the Paneer dishes which I tried once was well made. Dont be surprised to see a German Shepherd greeting you near the entrance, that's the owner's pet.

Advice to management - Start a bit early in the evenings :)"
Akshaya is right next to my office. Many a times we either order food or come to drink and eat. The food here is good especially the Biriyani. Even the Chinese is good. There is no music that plays. You could have a good time drinking and chit chatting.
Known for its butter chicken dish............................................................................................................
Possibly one of the better restaurants serving butter chicken without the frills of being a pricey place. Delicious stuff at a decent price. I've never been to the place and have only ordered so I can't comment on the ambience or service.
"My teammates took me to this place for my farewell lunch since it was closest from our office While entering I was little apprehensive about the quality of food and taste but to my surprise food was really goodAmbiance is not that attractive, small & cosy place with a bar set-up Two of my colleagues ordered a chicken biryani, while the Tuesday vegetarians ordered soup and momosAll three preparations were bang on and flawless except the soup texture could be improved and served in a better waySo if tacky ambiance is not a problem and you want to enjoy some yum Chinese food this place is for youKindly excuse the funny Indian Chinese dish names on the menu :)"
"Best place to hangout with friends on weakends not recomended for family
Food is good specialy the chinese
And have huge variety for veggies."
"I was alone and ordered one evil paneer for starter and aks special veg biryani for mains .

Overall a normal kind of taste , a strange thing , a dog was roaming inside the restaurant which made me concern about the hygiene of the food ."
"A typical bar scene restaurant but the atmosphere you need to watch an ipl match is apt.. the food and drinks were good as compared to the ambience of the place. We tried the liver fry masala, surmai tawa and the kheema pav which didn't disappoint us at all...a place in parel.which offers good food and doesn't drill a hole in your pocket is a plus ..but the peak hours cramped up seating and waiting is a big minus"
"For my birthday party my friends wanted to go to a drinking place. But me being a non drinker I was hesitant to go here looking at the name of this place. But in the end did do there.
Food we ordered included French fries, Chicken chilly, Chicken crispy and some veg item I don't remember name of.
French fries were ok and nothing great to write about.
Now coming to real stuff.
Chicken chilly and Chicken crispy. Both the dishes were one of the best I have ever tried. Chicken in chicken chilly was very soft and easy to chew. Excellent quality stuff. And flavor was great as well. Chicken crispy was also great in flavor and crispy which it is supposed to be.
Veg dish was ordinary at best and...read more"
"Order Type: Delivery.
Must try: Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, Butter chicken, Chicken Tikka. (North Indian in general).
I feel their North Indian offerings are much better than their chinese counter part."
"If someone looking for cheap booze...very good food...this is the right place. This place is always among the booze guzzlers,so u might not find any elite or a fine dine crowd ,but usually crowded by male group buzzing around.. As the place is always crowded on weekends and place is quite small too....but the food is thumbs up. Specially chicken tandoori. Just Love it. For ambiance its 2/5. For food its 4/5 and for price its 5/5."
Good food.. starters are good! especially the alishan kabab! a Must visit! Ambience is also nice!!
Best food must try alishan kabab one of best here rates are reasonable service is great
Been here just once never had any food but yeah serves well and ambience is good too. Alcohol rates are reasonable.
"Great food. Their biryani's are awesome, specially hyderabadi biryani. Vegetarian food is also very good. Quantity for home delivery is large. The only reason I have given it 4.5 instead of 5 is their decor, need some improvement."
great food ...nice moghlai section....;)
