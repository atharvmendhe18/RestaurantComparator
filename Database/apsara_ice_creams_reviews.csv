"Apsara ice cream located at Andheri lokhandwala is a very wonderful place to visit and chit chat n its amid in the lokhandwala shopping area people come up n shop in the market n then have ice cream to chill n spend quality time.
The ambience is good 10-15 people can accommodate.All the flavours are really very good but you must personally go and try it out ...

Guava ice cream-
Guava ice cream which serves the utmost taste of fuava coated with red chilly flavour tastes amazing.

Sithaphal ice cream also tastes very delicious n yummy ..."
"Best Icecream parlour in Lokhandwala hands down! Guava chilli Icecream, their best seller is finger licking delicious. They make amazing fruit sorbets as well, I love the Berry one and even watermelon one. They're really good at chocolate and also blueberry cheesecake Icecream. Overall I love their desserts specially because they're value for money and staff is really great. Their recent mosambi magic flavour has won my heart and I love their kulfi faloodas too. Special mention to the falooda Icecream which has pieces of takhmariya in it! Wow."
"Apsara is one of the best places for ice creams. I did try the Belgian Bite which was dark chocolate along with choco chips and also Brownie Blast, it was brownies crumbled with vanilla ice cream."
"They have an amazing range of ice creams. All the flavours are mouth watering. It is difficult to choose one flavour. And also the staff is very polite and courteous. Among the many ice creams, guava glory is a must try"

"Have one of the tastiest ice creams!

"One of the my personal favourite icecream parlour!!!
Known for their 2 tasty flavours
1)blueberry cheesecake
2) Guava glory

Best guava icecream with masala topping which is absolutely delicious
And blueberry cheesecake icecream which is delicate and lovely in taste!"
"Had been here with a friend for his bday treat , it's a small cute place , the best part was they accepted Paytm which was a saviour .
We tried some waffle coned ice cream like the romantic rose and the funky Ferrero few days back , the owner or manager is quite sweet and the staff is also really sweet .
Definitely try the Ferrero one in waffle cone it tastes really great a good deal and quite affordable for that taste .
Overall 4.5/5 , they have small space and it's mostly crowded need some chairs to sit :p"
"Best mango and ferrero rocher ice cream ever had
Taste 9/10 accurate
Good and comfortable seating/lights
Friendly staff and quick service
Budget friendly"
"Mango and strawberry ice cream blew my mind away! Loved the taste, loved the quality. Quite reasonable pricing as well. There are wide variety of flavours.

Taste:-4/5
Ambience:-3/5
Value for money:-4.5/5"
Have to go here whenever I am in Lokhandwala. Very very different from the traditional ice cream. My favourite is the Pani Puri ice cream can eat it all day.
"The Belgian Dark Chocolate and Alphonso ice cream blew my mind away! Loved the taste, loved the quality. Definitely trying their other flavours super soon."
Good ice creams and good ambience its clean and the flavours are always different and fresh i personally love the blue berry cheese cake ice cream
"Amazing flavours always something new to try. Fresh Mango peices with ice cream is to die for. Must have
Guava
Custard apple
Mango n Strawberry seasonal."
"Love their ice creams a lot.

Must try guava ice-cream with their masala and Alphonso mango. They are super tasty and gr8 in quality. It is very natural

Tried their alphonso milk shake, it is also nice."
"This season calls for an ice-cream, be it day or night, it's the best way to cool off. What better place than Apsara ice cream, they have a wide variety of flavours at a reasonable rate.

Have been here quite a few times and always enjoyed the icecream till my heart's content. Since it's the mango season, I tried icecream with fresh mango pieces. Wow what a delight in my hand, the mango was sweet and filled to the top with yummy and creamy icecream. Loved every bite of it."
"***This place is for serious ice cream lovers only*** :))

Every bite of ice cream needs to be soaked in slowly.

Guava Glory, Pan Pasand, Roasted Almond and of course the seasonal wonders like Sitafal, Alphonse mango spl or strawberry spl.

This parlour remains special with its flavours all through the year. Fruit sorbets are not be missed either!!

Definitely a goTo place for daily /weekend desert sessions."
They have decent flavours and service...and i like their pan flavour icecream...and they have lots of flavour out there so you have to go there to try your favourite flavour
"One of my blogger friend once went to review this place and ever since he suggested this place I wanted to visit and try.

Today, I came across one of their outlet in Lokhandwala,Andheri and I decided to hop in.

Trust me guys they have a beautiful sitting arrangements which I liked the most because usually you don't see such ambiance in ice cream Parlours.

They introduce new flavours very often which is great!!
Hence we tried below flavours,

1) chikoo : I am glad I decided to have this even when it sound very usual. You get a very strong flavor of chikoo and it's so delicious.

Rate : 5/5

2) Pineapple passion : A very sweet and tangy flavour.

Rate 4/5

Try this place guys. They have...read more"
"Great new (for those who havent been here yet) flavors. Personal favorites are cookie n cream, paani puri, falooda, blueberry cheesecake and almond. Quite reasonable pricing as well. You can get done in about 100 bucks for double scoop with waffle cone and lowest being around 60 bucks for single scoop in cup. Has become preferred ice-cream adda for some time now."
"The best place for ice cream and outings.
The ambiance is alot of fun.
They always have music being played, and the ice creams are just the best.
Would totally recommend
Blueberry cheesecake
And chocolate chips."
"Just ordered this so-called amazing apsara icecream guava & pani puri flavor. But i was highly surprised because I thought I will get ice cream but I got a chilly powder with a pinch of ice  cream and same with pani puri ..""Muh me to pani agaya tha par filhaal jaala hua hai... bhai ne jal jeere ko jama ke bhej diya .....samj nahi araha hai icream kahaya ya maasala powder.... to ab refund mila to asli ice cream kha lengaye nahi to zindagi to chal he rahe hai ..."
"I love their icecream especially the guava one the flavours are so exquisite and so delicious anyone would love to have them again and again .
I am really fond of Apsara Ice creams and I repeatedly visit them I also suggest people to try it out just expressing my review to let people known as as they offer a lot of various stuff variety in ice cream So do try them."

"When Twotable Spoons visited Apsara Icecreams: 

Kush: Well, my favourite dessert isn't there here in Arthur's theme. You up for iceream? 
Anj: Such a rhetoric question. Always. Duh!
Kush: Haha cool. Instead of Naturals, let's try Apsara today. For a change. :)
Anj: Okay, good idea. 
Kush: Wow, the songs they're playing here is so weird. Such old school.
Anj: I know. To make it look natural, the ambiance looks like a jungle. LOL. 
Kush: Anyway, I'll have a paan icecream & what's this Tamarind Twist? 
Anj: I'll have that. 
Kush: Paan is ok. Not out of the world as described by many. 
Anj: Tamarind twist is good but doesn't give me satisfaction of eating an icecream.

"The best things in life involve flicks (movies) and licks.  After a movie show at a nearby movie hall, landed at this place situated at the main Lokhandwala market (all decked up for Diwali, loved the atmosphere).  Usually go to a place opposite to this, but decided to try this outlet and literally and figuratively crossed the road and certainly did not regret the decision.  Had a orange apricot, anjeer akhrot and the Berry Bonanza, all three in different styles viz., cone, cup and waffle cone.  All the three flavours were bang-on and hit the right spots and satisfied each and every taste bud bar none.  The waffle cone was fresh and crisp, the orange flavour was as fresh as the fruit...read more"
"Apsara is one of the good places we have visited till now. Different things to taste in wide range of varieties. Taste is all good. Ambience perfect. Good and proper service provided. If you love dessert then once visit here. Overall performance good.

"Life Is Better With Ice-Creamüíï
Apsara icecream is the best place to visit if you love icecream üòç
Each and every flavour of icecream served here holds a very distinct tasteüòã
We tried :
Pineapple passion - pineapple tastes
the best with icecream!üòã
The season special fruit icecreams i.e Scrumptious sitafal, guava glory, asli Alphonso are a must try!!‚ù§
Flavours like blueberry cheesecake and pani puri moulded in the form of icecream are distinct and new for usüëåüèΩ
Kesar pistachio - the flavour of kesar and pistachio adds its beauty to the icecream üòç

Belgian bites, brownie blast, cookie...read more"
Had ordered pani Puri n guava ice cream.The delivery was on time.The taste of both the ice cream were amazing. I highly recommend this if you love ice creams.
"Ice-creams are loved by many and when it comes to experimenting with flavors, this brand has done a lot of it. The best one here is the Pani Puri Sorbet and Guava. Also the Imli and Watermelon flavor are worth a try!"
"I love apsara ice cream. And this place stood out my expectations. The seating was so good. The staff friendly and polite. The ice creams divine. Thats what you want when you walk into any place. Even though a small place, its spacious enough to accomodate more people. I tried guava chilli but opted for my all time fave blueberry cheesecake. I had their cones this time. Even though not appealing to look at it tastes just right. Crispy perfect ice cream cone and heavenly ice cream. Really an enjoyable experience."
"Didn't like the spread. Tried couple of them panipuri, guava chilli etc but didn't really enjoy any of them. Not able to make out but there was something missing in it..."
sugar free kesar pista is not at all good...was getting powder taste
I loved the ambience!! The service was also good!! I loved guava flavour the most as it had some topping which added to the original taste!! All my friends and me enjoyed been there and clicking lots of photos !!
"absolutely love the ice creams, sorbets and kulfi. The service is great, the quality and flavour of the ice cream is top notch!"
...
Had the most amazing guava icecream .. they even served it with a dash of chilli powder .. simply fantastic . Orange apricot was also good .. but would most definitely recommend the guava
"Happened to walk into this outlet with family the other day. Wasn't really in a mood to have ice-creams, but i did have a look at the variety while hobbling around. 

The 1st flavor that caught my eye was the Imli Flavored Ice Cream - Tamarind Twist ! And my god ! It is wonderful !

I have always loved eating raw tamarind of any form ever since i was a child. And this ice-cream, totally awakened the kid in me.

This didn't stop here. The Tamarind Twist made me want to try the other flavors too. And the next flavors I chose were Pani Puri Pathaka and Guava Glory.

It's wonderful how these guys manage to keep the natural flavors of Paani Puri and Guava with Masala (like the one's sold...read more"
Sugar free ice creams are great. Recommended for health freaks. Amazing flavours. Must try Guava ice cream with the Masala. I will definitely visit againüòä
good but spoon was not there
good service reached at before time
so late
not so good.. strawberry ice cream should have been milk based.. as paying 320 rs for water based strawberry flavour ice cream is too much.. the making cost is very cheap n less for this product.. I don't think so it should be this costly for this one particular ice cream.. plus the taste too was eww not at all good.. everyone got fade up in my family.. I feel I will stick around with only nutilicious ice cream.. from apsara thank you
"This is worst experience i have ever got from apsara ice cream, Andheri Lokhandwala. I had ordered 7 cups of ice cream... wherein 2 cups had dead insect in it and also there was no masala given with guava ice cream. After putting my complaint the person incharge offers for an overall replacement of the order, which i didn‚Äôt for. But when the delivery guy came with the new order (which apsara only offered) he started asking for the old ice cream cups, which apparently were thrown in the dustbin. He waited there and asked me to remove all the ice cream cups from the dustbin so that he can take it back. Also, when i called owner he too talked in a very high pitch and used abusive language...read more"
"Lovely ambience , good customer service, amazing flavours and consistent taste . Just love it. My all time fav is their gauva, I think the mango and strawberry needs a little more improvement in comparison to other flavours. You should definitely try the imli and panipuri flavours together with their masala, yumm"
too much time for delivering
I love their Trio Kulfi. Its a perfect balance of all the flavours. Thats the only reason I have anything close to desserts since I am on a diet. But I always end up giving in for the trio kulfi. Its definitely worth cheating on my diet! Go ahead and try it out guys wont regret it! They have other fancy flavoured ice creams too which are rare to spot.
Quantity is very less
super
"Life is better with Ice cream and its even better when you have Apsara Ice creams in the vicinity. Right in middle of Lokhandwala market Apsara is my go to place, known especially for their unique flavours.

My absolute favourites:
Guava glory with a dash of chilli powder (it sounded weird at first but its just amazing, a MUST try).
Jamun
Tamrind twist with chat masala (Imli fans should definitely try this)
Mango ice cream with Mango pieces (Full Alphonso mango with ice cream)

Special mention - The staff is very courteous and they encourage you to sample different flavours without flinching if you try too many üòâ"
5 stars always fr apsara ice creams
always full 5stars for apsara icecreams
Taste is waste
Amazing ice-cream the quality as well as the quantity here is amazing the guava flavour here is one of the best I have tasted the variety of flavors offered here is also amazing
"Excellent service and quality of ice cream. The flavour and texture taste the same from the day they have started. Home delivery is prompt as they have tied up with Zomato .The best franchise of Apsara, courteous staff and excellent delivery."
"The Guava + Red Chili icecream is such a clever innovation! 100% mouthwatering, super delicious! Can eat it over and over again! And the delivery guy came on time, despite heavy rains! Rain + Guava Chili icecream is goals!"
The packing was so bad that one Ice cream cup had spilled and the cups were kept upside down
very good just like last time
Yummy ice cream
"really good flavors, specially loved lychee and chocolate. pani puri is a weirdly fun flavour. My only problem was that the portion sizes were too small. I ordered medium size and it wasn't enough."
"Your ice creams are great .
However , I had added an extra comment , which was not implemented. Of writing the names of the flavours. Request you to Pls do this as a practice , as it becomes confusing to identify smaller sizes . Thank you !"
just the best . berry blast is my favourite . polished of a tub the same night
Charging more than MRP! Breaking government rules !!
"Apsara Ice creams!

There are amazing AMAZING varieties at apasara, and it's my go-to for my midnight cravings. And according to seasons

Vale for Money: 5/5"
"Apsara ice cream parlour is a part of ice cream chain present across Mumbai. The first shop was opened in Walkeshwar in 1971 and since then they have expanded across Eastern n Western suburbs of Mumbai. They also have very user friendly app for ordering ice creams online. They have an excellent loyalty program as well where one earns points at every purchase and the same can be redeemed for upgrades and ice creams later.

The speciality of this place is ice creams are made in the traditional wooden sanchas and they taste out of the world. They have huge variety of natural flavors including ones made from Shorbets and sugar free variety. The spicy guava and tamarind flavors are unique and...read more"
"Well it was my 2nd visit to Apsara in 2 days. This time at the Lokhandwala outlet.
Went with my usual ""Guava Glory"" & ""Pan""
Tasted tamarind flavour as well. (Was too sour for me) You can try out their other flavours from their diverse and innovative collection. (Pani Puri, Guava & Pan a must try for the 1st timers)
The purpose to review this outlet is because it has eye shattering ambience.
Small polychromatic place, sofa to relax, nicely lit hanging lights and an amazing floral/leafy flamboyant ceiling. Treating yourself to such an environment is next level.
Coming back soon !!"
good
"Had the Belgium bits & blueberry cheesecake cones. Fresh flavours and tasted amazing. They have a great range and some their stuff has taken innovation to the next level ie- panipuri icecream, paan icecream etc..they also have a seating area and a very courteous staff!!"
insane kulfi
You could deliver faster
The best ice cream parlour I have been to so far! All the flavors are amaazzing. Specially the pani puri and berry bonanza. P.s: the lokhandwala store is open till 2-3am üòÅ
Decent service. Delivery was quick and the right item was delivered.
ice cream taste is not good
"Have visited this place multiple times and it never disappoints. One of our favorite ice cream parlors. Absolutely love their guava , sitaphal ice cream. Mango , berry is a must try. Very affordable and good quality. Will visit soon"
Went on Sunday midnight around 12 that time also it was not empty. There were a couple of people. I got there mango pieces with malai kulfi and mango ice cream it was served in a pretty decent sized bowel the mangoes were delicious so were the ice cream and the Kulfi it was not too sweet what I liked the most about it unlike other ice creams are filled with sugar this one wasn‚Äôt. Do give this a try!!!
"being in mumbai for the longest time had not visited here and realised what i was missing . i have always had pani puri but was shocked to hear that here they served the same flavour in an icecream
it was remarkable as also some of he others whacky flavours they are renowned for 
the ingredients are top class and pure which can be made out with every slurp of the icecream
i have now been going regurlarly there 
only flip side is they close by 11.00 so have to time dinners accordingly if made up mind to eat icecreams at apsara that night
THANKYOU:)"
very good service
ok
"Apsara ice cream is perfectly locate on google map and easy to find in lokhandwalla complex andheri west outlets.

Apsara is one of the best ice-cream parlour for us, they managed the quality very well. Apsara never fails for amaze us. Ambiance is good, fancy, with good comfortable seating, frames, tag and line's, but the outer ambiance is distracting shop because of huge tree in front of the shop, Apsara's first outlate was very good in lokhandwalla just beside the Bread Kraft. The menu not so long but their many combination are very unique i.e. Chilli Guava, pani puri n masala sprinkle on ice cream to add a tastes very innovative, unheard flavour have governed a lot of attention. Apsara...read more"
The best thing about Apsara ice creams is that each and every ice cream here has a very natural milk taste to it unlike other ice cream parlours where you can make out the synthetic taste of milk. My fav is the guava ice cream. And I highly recommend it.
"I have been here for the first time and tried their seasonal icecream, i.e., Asli Alphonso. I felt like I am experiencing heaven on earth. Mango flavored icecream with Malai kulfi and one whole sweet Alphonso Mango chunks all together! I'm drooling while writing this reviewüòÇ
I would suggest everyone to go here and try their Asli Alphonso at least once (because I know it won't be once afterwardsüòù).

Caution : Don't see the pic if you got a weak heart."
fast delivery
Awesome ice cream! But it should have come with some ice.. Got it bit melted. Otherwise taste is on point! Loved mango n orange apricots the most.
