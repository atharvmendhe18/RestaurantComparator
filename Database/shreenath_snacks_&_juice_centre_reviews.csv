"This is a small restaurant located in mulund market which serves the best food at affordable prices. They have the best pav bhaji,i really loved the cheese pav bhaji. The Chinese food here is great too. We tried triple Schezwan Noodles,they were really yummy and spicy and the gravy was also good. They serve amazing starters too,one of my favourites is paneer hongkong. Chaas(buttermilk) is a must try here,it was very refreshing.
One of the best places to hangout at affordable prices!"
"Avoid ordering any food from this restaurant, tasteless and all was wasted"
Packing was not properly done
its deliciously delicious

not worth the money
Greavy Quantity is Less as compared to rice.taste wise ok.
2 extra pav missing. Khada pav bhaji appears to be normal pav bhaji.
rice was very spicy and it was not baked properly
"Shreenath juice center is the perfect place for quick bites at reasonable rates. The food is too tasty and at a reasonable price. The quantity of food is also quite enough. I have tasted their Shzwan rice, Sandwich and triple shezwan rice and all of them were awesome."
