Tasty food as always
"In the past 3-4 years food here at Raja has been the best. Today we planned to order food from here it has been quite disappointing. The triple rice was bland and lacked flavor, the Manchurian had very little gravy, the spring rolls were overly oily, and the dahi ke kebabs were sour and tasteless. Overall, it seems that the food was not prepared with much care or attention to detail. I would not recommend this restaurant to others based on our experience."

"Everything we ate was good. However, i feel pav bhaji taste was not that good. I really suggest if taste is changed. Chef needs to eat nearby resto jalsa & manohar bhaji. Market it well. South indian cuisine is just tooo good & its just 49 onwards:)"
