"Good ambience, great food"
Its unnecessarily expensive. We ordered 2 beer and 2 wines. And dal tadka and rice and paneer chilly. The bill came up to Rs. 4700. The food was not even awesomely tasty.
"If u are somebody who loves experimenting with food, this place is for you. Variety of non vegetarian dishes available. Definitely try out something from thw sea food and soup section."
"Recently been to this place....
Have really nice ambience...
I ordered Rajma Chawal which were yummüòãüòãüòã.....
Also Moong Daal ka Halwa Was delicious....
Looking forward to taste more dishesüòã"
Really nice and beautiful place to hangout and have your meal... So many delicious varieties of food available at minimum cost... üî•üî•
"This place will give you those chilled out Dhaba feels in the middle of all fine dine restaurants in Lokhandwala. Perfect place on a Saturday night for non party people who wanna sit back and relax with good food and alcohol. The service is very good, quick and friendly, we ordered quite a few things among which the Biryani was worth a try 4/5 and the lollipops were decent too. Their schezwan saunce tastes different, more tangy. The Afghani Mushroom in veg was good as well.

Definitely worth a visit."

"It was raining outside, when I reached the restaurant.
I was carrying an umbrella, the man at the gate asked me to give my umbrella since it was wet. I gave it to him. After having dinner, I forgot to ask back for the umbrella since it stopped raining.

Next day I called the restaurant, in return they told there is no umbrella with them and were not ready to listen what I was saying.

Coming on the food part, it was very average."
"Almond Flowerr is one of my ""All Time Favourite"" place which I prefer going whenever I can. Devoting an evening to this beautiful place with some dim lights, beautiful cosy ambience (Rooftop) and soft guitar playing in the background with some good old songs and of course the food!!
Let's talk about food. I am a big fan of their Galouti Kebab. It is more of heaven to have it. They are soft, delicious and worth having it. They are served with a variety of Chutneys. The next in the list is Dahi Kebab. It was equally tasty and mouthwatering as the Galouti!. In the Main-Course, we ordered Paneer Lababdar with some bread.

"Almond Flowerr is one of the best North Indian restaurants across Andheri. Located near Infiniti Mall, this place is a heaven for authentic North Indian food flavours. We visited this restaurant on a Saturday night and it was very full and we completely understood the reason behind it. The rooftop with Indian seating is perfect for a couple or a group of friends looking to spend some time to chill in the winter.

What we had?

This vicinity of andheri lokhandwala is packed with fancy looking and trendy sounding restaurants and yet sometimes it gets indeed difficult to zero down on a restaurant for a meal.

"Catch up with your friends at this place .
Loved the ambiance and the different varieties of starters they serve you while you are sipping your mock tails"
"The name Almond Flower always attracted me. I was too curious to find out why such a name for a North Indian Restaurant and Bar. A Saturday lunch with friends brought me here and I had to ask why the name. They told me there have been 2 Almond trees outside the restaurant since the beginning, hence the name.

They have nice colorful interiors and a rooftop seating as well which is available in evening. Graffiti walls attract you while funky chairs and tables won't let you leave.

Coming to what we tried here..

This place has one of the coolest rooftop seating's in Mumbai. An Indian seating for a group of friends is the best thing for a rooftop! I loved the live guitarist playing music for us in the evening. The food here itself is very good. I loved the Paneer Makhani and the Chole Kulcha at the place. Gonna come again soon with my friends.
A small and quaint place near Infiniti Mall in Andheri - a very good to have food for lunch and dinner. I had booked this place for a family dinner in the evening and Ioved the ambiance of the whole place. The food served was very good and the service was prompt with the owner himself explaining us the dishes and the inspiration of how it came to the menu. Very quick and cheerful staff. I loved the family dinner at Almond Flowerr and so did my family. Gonna come again soon.
Almond Flowerr is one of the best North Indian restaurants in Mumbai! I love the food at this place. The Daal Makhani and the Amritsari Kulcha are ones that you'll crave every time you're hungry. The Moong Daal Halwa reminds me of my childhood where my mom used to make the same for me. The Matka Kulfi is the perfect end to any meal in Mumbai. Love the place and the ambiance. Service is good.
"This place is Lokhandwala is a wonderful place to have North Indian Food. A two level place with soft music ambiance and swift service makes it a good evening place with a small bar and classic cocktails.

The food here is very good as well. My favourites are the Chole with Amritsari Kulcha and the Afghani Mushrooms ‚ù§ Gonna come very soon to this place again."

Reaching late at night around we ordered the Murg dakhni nimbu mirchi for starers. The chicken was well cooked, creamy texture with hints of spice was a good start to the meal.

To accompany the nan, roti we ordered the murg dhaba curry, mutton bhuna masala and chicken Dum biryani for rice.
The dhaba curry was a thinner gravy but was flavorful and did give you a stronger hit of the masala compared to the mutton buna which was a thicker heavier gravy. Both dishes were perfectly suited for a roti or garlic naan.
The chicken biryani was well...read more"
"I have eaten at Almond Flower twice , the food is decent, prices very reasonable and the ambiance of the cushioned seating rooftop area is nice and comfortable. If you want kebabs, daal makhani naan, your regular standard Indian restaurant food, you'll get it there. It's worth a three because it's nice but not out of this world."

But the food was not as mentioned
It was damn spicy.. .even after telling them not to make the food spicy..
The quantity was poor.
And the taste were blazing flames...
It's a place good for pple who drink.. But not for a causal dinner as it was horrible
And these pple have service tax.. That's more worst"
"Tried this place for Sunday lunch and it was not crowded but happy hour was on. We sat in AC section but they have outdoor and rooftop section as well. Decore is rustic.
Chicken kebab and fish starter was delitious. Portion size was good. Bhatti wala murg gravy was good with nice soft naan bread. The taste do reflect authentic Northen taste. Pricing is decent considering the area."

"Visited on Friday night after ofc. It was my third visit to the almond flower. I always prefer to sit on roof top. It is a small area decently decorated, gives a very soothing feeling. Ordered pitcher and it comes in a jar, we were expecting it in a tower. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our beer. In starters we ordered, basa fish tikka and chilli garlic prawns. Fish was very delicious, prawn was OK. In main course we ordered mutton bhuna and lachha paratha. Mutton was well cooked and its gravy was very tasty. Paratha was as usual.

"Almond flowerr the name comes from the two almond trees which is located outside the restaurant.

"This place is located near Marks & Spencer Showroom at Adarsh Nagar, Andheri West. As name ""Almond Flowerr"" one would expect an Oriental cuisine but this restaurant is all about North Indian with smattering of Mughlai and Chinese as well. This fairly inexpensive restaurant serves some superbly-spiced tandoori stuffed aloo, a home-style rajma chawal (not something you see on many menus) and their Rajam ka Galouti is another tasty dish.

very bad food not good for health
"With a very unique name for a Punjabi cuisine outlet, this restaurant stands out not just for the delicious food but also for the pleasant ambience and fantastic service. The chicken shredded soup followed by tangdi kabab and then panner butter masala accompanied with kulcha and laccha paratha turned out to be wonderful dinner outing."
Ordered the chicken triple rice for home delivery after reading multiple reviews praising it to the skies. The rice portion is practically chicken feed and the gravy is disproportionately on the higher side. What‚Äôs worse is that everything is given in separate boxes which makes the whole thing absolutely pointless. Absolutely zero value for money.
Good food. Not the typical over rich & heavy restaurant food. Yet delicious
"How offen we see any restaurant tagging its name considering the nature around it. So yeah, the name almond flowerr came from the two almond tree planted on both the side this 3 faced restaurant, the reason I said 3 faced is because the place is divided into 3 sections- the outer, the indoor and the roof top for your romantic mood.

"Almond Flowerr is one of the best places in Lokhandwala to have dinner and spend an amazing evening. The place has amazing ambiance and one of the best hospitality services. We tried the North Indian Food at the place. Mind it, keep your stomachs empty; you're getting in for a feast. Afghani Mushrooms, Angara Kebab, Amritsari Kulcha, Daal Makhani, Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken and what not! My list will keep on going but the delicacies of this place will keep on surprising me."
