Review
"This is a go to place for me and my colleagues. We go here at least one a month for lunch.
The ambience it the restaurant is nice and calm. Usually there isn't a lot of rush or commotion. They even have an upstairs area.

The staff is well trained and polite. I have never faced any issues with the service.

Coming to food,

We have a usual favorite and it is Chicken Patiala. It is Chicken chunks made into gravy that comes wrapped in an omelette. It's nice, creamy and not spicy. Tastes really good when a little lemon juice is moved into it.

Another recent favorite is their Butter Chicken which is cooked beautifully and surprisingly has a slight of spicy taste to it which I really...read more"
"The place is a small and a go to one with the family. Located around alleyways of fort, this place takes you back in time of your parents. The food is nice and any seafood lover will have a nice time."
"When a mistake is found out and pointed out, it is rather foolish for the manager to make silly excuses that nullify the intelligence of the one who pointed out the blunder. Conflict Resolution must be included in Hospitality Management and the Manager of Ankur - The Coastal Bistro must go attend that course. Giving us the same dish as a way of making up, still charging us for that dish and worst of all NOT apologizing and instead making silly excuses AND arguing is VERY distasteful (pun definitely intended) and inhospitable!! Definitely not visiting again!! üò£üò∑üò≤‚òπÔ∏èüò®"
"We went to this place after hearing from friends, but was very disappointed by the pathetic service, staff does not take good care of you.
We ordered manchow soup and the noodles with them were soggy, and upon asking them to replace it came after 3 reminders.
Food was ok in taste, the paneer was not so fresh, garlic naan is so thin and crispy."
"The standards here have dropped. My friend & I were the only patrons at the resto. It was completely empty with just the staff. The prices are exhorbitant here compared to other fab seafood restos in the area like Mahesh, Apoorva & Modern Lunch Home. A plate of fried fish here costs 650 Rs which is available down the road at an equally good resto at a mere 220 Rs. I‚Äôm not one to complain about prices but I expect great quality if I am paying this much money.

Let‚Äôs talk about the food now.

The prawn curry felt watered down & lacked the pungency to be expected. The flavour profile was dominated by a tad too much coconut milk at the cost of all other flavours. The prawns felt...read more"
"Amazing sea food in south mumbai !!
Must try items are the prawn Ghassi , uppams,
Neer dosa, the rawas fish starter also is yum!
They also have amazing clams and a very tasty mutton main course.
Overall the food was super tasty and 100 percent authentic South Indian style.
Mouth watering , must visit for every sea food lover.
Deserts try their signature orange Kulfi, it‚Äôs out of this world."
"We have been visiting Ankur regularly, like every two months. We have found that the quality of food has gone down.
The restaurant has declined our request for cocktails or mocktails, since the bartender was sacked a few months ago.
The butter garlic crab used to be awesome. This time it was burnt and smelt and tasted burnt. The garlic cheese nans were also burnt.
We also ordered a prawn gussy and specifically asked whether the prawns were fresh as we had rubber prawns here two months ago. The captain assured us that the prawns were fresh. We specifically asked for small or medium sized prawns as they are much tastier. The prawn gussy arrived and the prawns were larger than small...read more"
A good southee resto a delight for the non vegs. The food here is quite low on preservative and artificial taste enhancers. The fish is pretty fresh and reasonal order most of the stuff and it will satisfyburn pallete. The chicken curries are also worth a try and quite different frm other restos. Avoid their cocktails not that gr8. And ofcourse their biryani is must for those who wana have a lighter and easy on tummy version of an aromatic biryani. The staff is not very courteous but then the food wins ur heart.
"Ankur is a Manglorean food lover's paradise ... This restaurant, is a very old restaurant which is tucked away in the by-lanes in fort and sometimes maybe difficult to find. The ambiance is welcoming, and they still have i think some Cricket memorabilia which one must check out.

With regards to the food, I must say they serve delicious and spicy varieties of Prawns / Fish (Surmai, Rawas, Pomfret etc), Crabs Lobsters & Clams. The wait staff is very courteous and helpful, you may ask him for suggestions depending on your spice tolerance. The very basic rava coated deep fried seafood is awesome as well

"The sparsely populated legendary restaurant serves great food coupled with great service. The ambience is nice too. If you seek privacy from all the chaos in Bombay, head here."
"Tucked in a small lane in the lanes near Bombay Stock Exchange, here is a restaurant that can give Trishna, Mahesh and Apurva run for the money for the food. What really brings it down is the service which I think they have to improve. They have to be serving with a smile, give foodies some space. It felt as if we were a burden. That is the only reason their rating come down from 4.5 to 3.5
Food is amazing and I personally much better #trishna. The Butter Garlic Crab is really well done. The Fish Thekkady- Pomfret is great and perfectly spiced. Add this with Appam or Neer dosa and soul kadi and you get a perfect meal. 
Imagine prawns that are grilled on a Tawa smelling of local Kerala...read more"
"My all time favourite sea food place. Much better than some of the other places that are better rated. Try the Butter Garlic Crab, it is to die for! Also the Fisk Thekkady and the Fish Kochi! My mouth is watering even as I think about it."
"Myself along with my family been to this place last night. No other customers in restaurant yet supervisor n staff behavior was pathetic. They were like doing a favor on us - No smile No courtesy.
As we settled in supervisor walked towards our table and asked us ""Yes what you want?""
We have ordered some drinks along with starters n followed by main course. I really liked the food intact it was excellent but when we wanted to order some more drinks - supervisor told us bar is closed - Without asking us for our last order they have simply closed their bar.
Being a hotelier myself It was a totally disappointing experience.
If management does not take action then I am sure they will...read more"
"Was here with friends on a Saturday night. Called for the Fish Thekady (Rawas), Kerala Prawns and Squid Kundapur.
Will admit that I was a little apprehensive about whether the portions and quality of food would match up to the price that was being charged per dish (it's a bit on the higher end) but they did justice to it.

All the dishes were really unique and well-cooked. The spices in the prawn and the tenderness of the squid is quite commendable.

The staff was quite helpful in helping us select the right dishes.

The ambience of the place is sharp, bright and kind of retro but not like the evidently out-there retro decor of other places.

Would surely love to come here again and...read more"
"Been here twice, first with a friends recommendation and ofcourse second time with own experience. The food is very authentic and an abode for spice lovers! Order anything in non veg the food taste delicious!"
"Very fresh and delicious sea food! Highly recommend prawns or crab xacuti...Delish. we also ordered lobster butter garlic, uppam (which was super fresh and soft) and mushroom tikka masala which was my fav of the night. Pompfret filets were boneless and done to perfection - very tender. Ankur may not have the reputation of Mahesh or Trishna, but most definitely has food and service which rivals theirs..Highly recommend for sea food around fort."
One of my all time favourites. Don't miss the prawn koliwada and butter garlic crab and naan. Beats trishna in my eyes every time. Prawn Gussi and neer dosa is so yum too !
"If u r a sea food lover like me...this place will not disappoint u..i ate like there's no tomorrow..my tastebuds were satisfied but not my appetite!
Absolutely loved their crab tikota, Kerala squid,bombil fry and clams sukha!"
"The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because of the rates. A little too expensive but the taste is great!! Good selection of Fish and Shellfish plus point is that alcohol is served. Kerala prawns are a must and so is the squid butter garlic.

It's on the quieter side and is perfect for family dinner. Places like these need more coverage than the newer crap that's coming up."
"The dishes do look and are a bit expensive but are a absolute tasty, the style of cooking is very authentic. Should definitely try especially with family and friends whom you would like to treat the best."
"As the name suggests, the place is known for its sea-food though being a vegetarian, I cannot comment on it. However, for all the office go-ers in south mumbai looking for places to have dinner and drinks on friday night, this place is worth your consideration. It is not prominently located nor will you find it in among the first ten restaurants when you search for places to eat in fort on zomato. However, the place is famous by word of mouth and has some loyal regulars - mostly parsee families from south Mumbai and an occasional foreigner brought along by locals. Ankur has quaint, cosy interiors. Around 8 wooden tables with wooden chairs and/or sofas with upholstery that is pleasing to...read more"
"The quality of food is really really good! Restaurant is known for it's seafood. Must try their Crab soup. A little over priced! Service is great. The staff here is helpful and gives genuine recommendations. Ambiance is quite calm and peaceful.
Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Price: 4/5"
Fort has some of the best sea food restaurants in Mumbai and this is certainly one of them. A little pricey but the food taste compensates for it. Service is good. Love the south indian style sea food dishes that they offer. Must try are Kerala prawns and prawns gassi.
Nice seafood place. The service is exceptional. Limited menu though. The famous dishes like Kerala prawns and other dishes are well made . Spicy food but could be paired with wine. Go for it.
"Always a peaceful and quiet place even when it's pretty packed. The food has always been good. May a bit on the heavy side when it comes to the pay, but definitely worth it, especially when any dish includes ""Kerala"" in it."
"One of the best seafood places I have ever been. Its not prominently located but seems to have its own patrons as when I entered it was almost full and remained till I left 2 hrs later
For appetizers Ravas Kaalimiri and Squid Butter Garlic is a must try. They have good selection of seafood. Fish also seems to be very fresh. Kerala Prawns and Clams Karawali is good too
Service needs improvement as waited for ages before we got our beers refilled
Overall an must visit destination if you are a seafood lover.
Food 5/5
Ambiance 4/5
Service 3/5"
"It's a small but classy place. Great interiors and service. Absolutely, love the food!!

The crab soup is creamy and other non vegetarian entr√©es were great as well but I feel I need to point out the underrated star of the menu- veg gassi! It was so good that I couldn't stop eating. Get it with neer dosai and the same thing will happen to you. I just had to try making it at home the next day because I just couldn't stop thinking about it! Do try this if you're in Fort. Just ask them to make it less spicy and you're good to go.. :) :)
At the end of the meal, if you still have space for dessert do try one of their creamy kulfis, either the regular flavor or the orange one.
I shall return...read more"
Top class seafood with a matching ambiance. It's family run with mother in law recipes. Ankur is far better for me than the over rated crowded commercial seafood joints of Fort. It's doesn't have the touristy feel like the other ones around. The food is simply great. Everything from the clams to the curries are well spiced and tasteful. The butter garlic prawns were huge. This place is a must for me when I'm out for seafood. The ambiance and food is just correct for a rich dining experience. Am a regular here.
"It's a small, cozy and nice place. Wanted to try this place after hearing good reviews on seafood. I ordered Meen Kaidina (Pomfret) which tasted very delicious. It was soft, nicely cooked. It was different in terms of the presentations and taste. The restaurant gives you nice green and orange chutney. Orange chutney is made of coconut and its yum! So tried my fish with the orange chutney. Also ordered, lasooni jhinga again it was nicely cooked, fresh and delicious. I even ordered tandoori fish based on the manager recommendation but for me it was an alright dish. It was dry, bit too chewy. Overall the experience here was good. Must try for all seafood lovers out there."
"Gone gone to the dogs

I had been a regular to Ankur for years & I am sad to write that in spite of trying to excuse for the last three times, they have gone to the dogs
The food has made me sick again & again
The service has become very bad
The manager has become totally unflexible 
The food uncooked , I had to return the food 

I will never come come back here again it's just not worth going 5o a Resturant which can't serve decent food & can't serve & just overcharges"
"In short, if you haven't been here already, a visit is required surely just to gorge on the sea food and you can thank me later for it.

What I like? 
- Fish Kochi and Fish Thekkady were star of the evening.
- Impeccable service and hospitality. 
- The place is located in the quaint old town giving a contemporary vibe unlike other commercial sea food places in Mumbai"
"The place really well located near the Hutatma Chowk/ Flora Fountain. We were a group of four with two veggies. The ambience of the place was very good. Despite reaching there at 8.45 on Friday night, the place was pretty empty.

We ordered two soups - one crab soup and another Manchaw soup. The service was timely and good. As a starter, we ordered veg schezwan fingers which were truly delicious. Since we had decided to have light dinner, we directly opted for rice - veg Hyderabadi Biryani and Prawn Hyderabadi Biryanis. Again both the dishes were tasty.

Finally we ordered Malai Kulfi and Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. The ice cream was bit disappointing as we could taste some hard...read more"
Ordered online using Zomato - Zomato showed me a bill of Rs. 555 and when the delivery guy came he handed me a bill of Rs. 750. I spoke to the restaurant and they were extremely rude so I had to send the food back - don't order from here for home delivery.
"I do crave good coastal food while I am in the city. During my last visit to Mumbai, I was hugely disappointed by my usual haunt of last 8 years. That is when a Mallu friend (who is a foodie himself) recommended Ankur to me. Given the source of recommendation, I was sure about the food at this place even before I got there. But didn't realize I was walking into a place which will be my new favourite for coastal food for times to come. We ended up ordering a huge variety of fish, prawns and mutton and I totally loved every single dish that we ordered. Fish thekady, Fish kalawari, and Kerala prawns were very fresh and appropriately flavored. Also I tasted the best appams ever, at Ankur's....read more"
"Ankur serves the best sea food in town I must say. Coastal punch on ever dish can be felt. Entire menu is filled with delicacies. Starting things with sol-kadi, it is perfect in taste & exactly how it is prepared in konkan. Must try in sea food would be- Pomfret malgudi, Pomfret tandoori, Prawns Karawali, and Crab karawali. For those who prefer chicken should try Chicken kundapur and Chickens lazeez. In desert do try Malai kulfi. Some flavours are seasonal. Value for money is good. Ambience is great and warm. Service is good as well. Must visit. Thumbs up."
"An American friend suggested we take her here to dine.So I booked a table and there we were.

Hidden in the by lanes of Fort and started way back In 1941 the decor of this Coastal Bistro had an old world charm.With a teak wooden roof and wrought iron lights this was equipped with a full fledged bar though I did not get the chance to taste their Kokum Marguirita or their Tamarind Martini as their bartender was absconding today.

We ordered all their signature dishes ranging from butter garlic crabs (deshelled ) to lobsters to Clams (okay types...home made are better ) to squids to Kerala Prawns and various types of fish.All these served with Appams and Neer dosas.

It was a reunion with...read more"
"This restaurant is generally underrated, and very similar the ones that are duly highly rated! Ankur is equally good, and in fact is quieter, has equal or better service, and......AND,.....has great food: whatever you want in Seafood or in the Mangalorian manner of cooking, IT IS HERE!!"
"Decided to place an order from Ankur - The Coastal Bistro. On placing the order, I was promised a delivery time of 45 minutes. However got my food only after 1.5 hours while the place we ordered from isn't too far from the restaurant. 

Food: 
1. Meen Gassi with Neer Dosa: Neer Dosa was soft and well made and it stayed like that even when the food had gone cold after it arrived to us. Meen Gassi was strictly okay. Usually the gassi I've eaten elsewhere it slightly thicker and flavourful. Meen Gassi from Ankur was too watery and lacked flavour.

2. Kerala Chicken: This dish was a winner. Perfectly made chicken in south indian style with a lot of black pepper.

Overall, might give this...read more"
"I must say this is one of the hidden places to have the most delicious seafood... Situated in the narrow lanes of Fort but this place is a must visit for all seafood lovers. The kochi Pomfret fry is a must try here. Also the fish & prawns gassi with neer dosa is simply amazing. Squid koliwada is yummy & crispy.
Interiors of the restaurant are very warm & welcoming. Couldn't sit in the upper section though.
Service was quick & responsive, definitely worth visiting again."
"Awesome food and service.
The food is consistent and quality of seafood is always fresh and scrumptious.
The staff can be a bit intrusive standing close by but that's better than having to keep calling out to them"
"Ankur by far has been one of the best seafood restaurants ive been to. Exceptional cooking of the fish and superb presentation. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant as well as the staff and the promptness of the food ordered on the table. All in all we ordered the crab manchow soup, calamari , prawns , bombay duck, ravas and the butter garlic crab. A beautiful meal with deliciously woven spices and fragnances! Must try"
Definitely one of the most underrated seafood restaurants around south Bombay. I always begin with the velvety smooth crab Calcutta soup which is a buttery thick soup with tender prices of fresh crab. In apps we had the Kerala Prawns (definitely not for people who do not like pepper) another favourite dish of mine is the squid tikota in which has a mild curry flavour. Followed this with the bombil fry. In the mains we kept it simple by just getting the prawn gassi and neer dosa with a portion of steamed rice. A result haunt of mine and will definitely go back!
If there's a place you absolutely must go to when in need of brilliant prawns and spicy chicken- look no where else. Also don't miss out on the beautiful sol kadhi.
"Simple home cooked food. Decent fish curry rice, so definitely enjoy that. It is cooked in the Mangalorean style. The staff is very adjusting, so you could tell them the spice level that you need.It looks like they have been around from a long time, with the way the service is.
They could do better with the decor. It has a mid nineties look. Doesn't look like a sea food place from outside."
"Stick to seafood at this coastal bistro and steer clear of chicken dishes ‚Äì the meat is tough and the flavors are unsatisfying. The Kerala prawns are juicy, fiery and succulent. The moist, delicately flavored neer tella with gassi (fish and prawn) is a party in your mouth ‚Äì of coconut curry infused with spices. The rawas kalimiri is tender and perfectly spiced. Portions are small."
Certainly full marks on the ambience which is remarkably well done and very pleasing as you walk in. It was just coincidence that I walked into Ankur when the actual intention was to step in into Cafe Military for some Parsi food. Had Surmai Gassi with Rice and Fried Squids. The squids was just awesome and freshly made. The blend of spices was very well balanced and tiny bit of lime over it made the whole tongue to come alive. The rice was plenty for a hearty meal and the gravy which came with Surmai was excellent. I was very sure I wanted the coconut blended one. You cannot have South Indian fish curry minus the coconut milk. It is outrageous. I wanted mine with coconut milk and that was...read more
"For me food has to be palatable, served in a place which is clean and the server has an affable smile on her/ his face. Ankur for me is all of this and more.
My first experience here was an important client business-lunch which turned into me foodgasming into gassis, parotas, appams, squid masalas and crab gravies. The association has thus continued.
The produce is fresh and the quantities are just about appropriate. This is one coastal Mangalorean joint right at the heart of Mumbai that you cannot miss for anything.
Their menu has many seafood options and the best thing is that they are always stocked with the freshest of produces.
One of my favorite joints if I am in a mood of a few...read more"
The Chicken biryani served in a clay pot is the one and only reason I'd keep going back to this place. Not a place where you'd want to try Chinese. Good ambience. Crowd is sophisticated. Appealing interiors but a quite place to be frank.
One of the best coastal seafood cuisines in the region. The ambience is a fusion of old school and new school - overall very warm. Will keep going.
"Ankur is located right next to my office hence I have visited this place a couple of times mainly for 'yaani' a dessert which is basically ice-cream served with dates. It's a must try..
The interiors are pretty dark and boring however the Food quality and portion size is decent here. I have tried almost all the dishes they serve. They also serve soul kadi which is pretty decent and can be tried.
For a quiet & hasty office lunch one can come here. Service is like that of a typical family dining restaurant - see the menu, order, eat, use finger bowl and move out please.."
"Awesme food...best dishes for me...kerala prawns,prawns karawali,fish tekhady...and dum chicken biryani..

"2130 hours, 3rd June 2015, Wednesday, Fort:

The Prelude: 
=============
What everyone doesn't know is that Ankur has been around since the preindependence era - since 1941. It is one of the pioneer restaurants started as a small Udupi pure veg food stall to reinvent itself as a Coastal sea food restaurant in the late 1990s to again slowly metamorphose into a fine dining bistro bar of today. Started by Mr Murtanna Shetty in the days of yore, in fact the entire street is known after his name - M P Shetty Marg.

"Go here with people who know what the eat. Small, not easy to find, but worth the journey into the narrow streets behind the stock exchange. Always empty and recently re-managed, Ankur won't disappoint for sea food and beer / rum. Good Ghassi and areas. Fried food is avoidable (squid / bombil)."
One of the oldest establishments in south Mumbai. Brilliant food. The vegetarian options were fresh and tasted quite nice. Great ambience. Helpful and cooperative staff. A definite favorite amongst office goers. The place has been open since 1960s.

Owned by Devdas Alva and now in partnership with Gaurish Rangnekar, this restaurant has its simplicity and honesty that made it warm and cozy.

We washed this down with a delicious cocktail - the kokum margerita which was made with tequila and chaat masala...a must have.

Prawn or fish gussi specially with Neer Dosa is always a hit. The Kerala style prawns is another favourite. Oddly enough despite this being a fish joint their mutton dishes are also brilliant.

"A vegetarian take!!Aromas of fried fish and coconut curry wafted out and welcomed me at Ankur a coastal eatery located in one of the Fort by lanes. Started in 1941 this has been the underdog in popularity whilst enjoying loyal patronage. As a vegetarian it was a tough choice to pick this place for lunch, however the Tamarind Martini created by Gaurish Rangnekar a good friend of mine and also a partner at the eatery did me in. For the Gowd Saraswat Brahmin community that I come from, you surely would find the fishy salinity in our blood but for mine the vegetarian outlier.

"I had heard so much about this place and it's food that I just had to go there. The ambience is like a typical classy South Indian house with wooden interiors. Jazz music just adds to the sophistication of the place. The menu is very impressive. It's loaded with a variety of dishes with special importance given to sea food. I ordered pomfret fry and fish curry with rice, it was just heavenly. You could taste the traditional spices, the freshness of the fish and the flavours in the curry. It is easily one of the most authentic South Indian sea food I've tasted in this city. It might be a little heavy on the pocket but good planning will definitely help you. It is a must try."
"I had a very good weekend filled with fabulous meals and Ankur, The Coastal Bistro is one of the reasons that made my weekend!
The restaurant is situated near Flora Fountain in Fort Area. It is a bit hidden for those who come for the first time. It is not very big either but there's another floor (mezzanine).
At first I was not that excited to try another Indian style seafood restaurant as I already have my favorite places (Trishna, Gajalee, Mahesh), but after this experience, I have a new favorite Indian seafood restaurant in Mumbai!

"Definitely great coastal food with each preparation having an individual character. My only grouse is that at the prices they charge the quantity of actual meat in any dish is really really disappointing. The prawn we had had a total of 8 very small pieces and the fish curry just 4 small cubes. For over 400 rupees for each dish, you will expect more."
"Located in the same lane as cafe military. The restaurant has been there in fort area since years now. Had ordered for korri roti and chicken karawali with neer dosa and roti along with peach ice tea. The korri roti is a dish based from karanataka. A combination of red chicken gravy eaten with extremely thin and crispy dry wafers made from boiled rice. I have never eaten this dish in my life so I cannot comment on the authenticity but it tasted good. But the definite winner was the chicken karawali which was suggested by the service staff. It was spicy and a perfect blend of chilies, garlic, ginger and tomatoes. Definitely one of the best coastal chicken dishes I have ever had. The peach...read more"
"Discovered this place accidentally, and have been regular visitor since. The food here is excellent. Prawn Gassi, any item with the Kundapur masala and THE Mutton adajina are to die for. The neer dosa and red rice with fish curry is a must have too. Location in a quiet street makes it difficult to spot, but look out/ask for Cafe Military and you will find this place."
"The USP of Ankur is its Thekri. That is in fact all I visit for, and it is one of the best fish preparations I have had anywhere in India. Have it with neer dosa.

Ankur is far superior to over-rated counterparts such as Mahesh Lunch Home or Trishna."
"This hidden away little gem is a nice pocket friendly alternative to the more famous seafood joints in the city like Trishna, Mahesh or Gajhalee. The Pomfret Tekhady and prawn gassi are delicious, especially when accompanied with neer dosa. Definitely worth a visit for people who love seafood!"
"A vegetarian reviewing a Mangalorian restaurant that specializes in sea food? Well, we vegetarians eat too, you know? Anyway, here‚Äôs my review along with excerpts from my two non-vegetarian friends who accompanied me to Ankur at Fort.

Food- I hadn‚Äôt eaten Mangalorian food before and this was a first for me so we asked the owner Mr. Devdas to recommend things to eat. So, some of their dishes are named after places and they use masalas made in house. Even the paneer they use is made in house. He suggested we try the Kerala Paneer (Paneer mixed in an herbs & pepper paste). Even though a little spicy because of the pepper, the herbs used made the dish flavourful and delicious! I had...read more"
"We visited Ankur expecting food on par with some of the other popular sea food restaurants in the area ( Apoorva, Canara and the likes) but what we got here was even better. Visit Ankur for three reasons : 1) Their authentic Manglorean dishes 2) The freshness of the ingredients 3) A charming and welcoming owner Mr. Devidas."
Expensive excellent sea food
"My two visits to Ankur could not have been further apart in terms of an experience. The first time we had the entire place booked out for lunch for a shoot crew. Great food.
The second time I went with some sea food loving friends and ended up getting some fairly appalling food which most items ranging from bad to just meh. To add to it, they kept trying to bill me for stuff we hadn't ordered, drinks, bottles of water, dishes.

In short - never ever going back there."
This place is a hidden gem in town. I have visited this place many times n have nva been disappointed. No matter wat u order its always ticklin ur taste buds.Amazin sea food served yer.Thou this place is heavy on d pockets but its completely worth d expense.
"I have had authentic manglorean stuff in mangalore but this place edges out the mangalore an joints too. Owned by Devidas Shetty, the moment you enter the restaurant, you get the mangalorean feel looking at the roof. The staff is very friendly and helps with the menu."
"Great Sea Food, Very good service and cuisine preparation was so good that I had much more than what i would usually eat at any restaurant. One true hidden gem in Mumbai for Coastal cuisine lovers."
"A stone‚Äôs throw away from the Flora Fountain statue lays a hidden gem in Bombay‚Äôs old working district. Established in 1941, Ankur is a multi-cuisine restaurant famous for its Konkan costal palette, serving delectable dishes for the true gourmands. The space is split with a mezzanine, accompanied by a m√©lange of wood and stone interiors along with a colonial chandelier as its centre piece. It takes you back to simpler times where the setting was warm and cozy, and the food honest.
If you like to devour fish or any crustaceans I suggest you give your taste buds a free rein here. Unlike its commercial cousins in this niche seafood specialty segment you will get a chance to enjoy...read more"
"One of the best places to go to for Sea Food. I've been here about 4 to 5 times, and every single time I go there, I make it a point to have their Sol kadi - it's brilliant. Also, their mushroom tikka - it is the ultimate best. This place has a good ambience, Efficient service, a very good and diverse menu. What else is there to say? Don't think about it twice, just try Ankur next time."
"Lovely food and the ambience is that of sereneness.
The Paneer chilli is delicious but the sea food beats all.
Especially the prawns, they are one hell of a meal.
And one shouldn't miss the sweetdish. The service is very quick and efficacious. Oh, I forgot about the mushrooms, they are my favourite.
Suffice it to say, Ankur has got amazing food !
And if you are a sea food lover, then this place is heaven for you."
"First things first... the place is an absolute value for money and the food is just the way they promise 'authentic'

having been brought up in a typical shetty household i m very critical bout way fish smells in a restaurant, and almost impossible to impress, but each and every single time i eat at ANKUR the food is absolutely delightful be it the kerala prawns kochi fish or the regular coastal cuisine.

The friendly staff and the always around Devdas Shetty ensures that you get on your table exactly what you like!

Must try: kerala and kochi preparations
Must skip: lime to garnish the perfect preparations and yes you can have Chinese food just about any wer!

It was an awesome experience dining at ankur restaurant. Though this is the first time I come here I felt at home. Such good service by mr Ramesh and I order all the hotel specials suggested by Mr ganesh what a good sea food. . Here goes my order we had prawn karawali and fish kundapur and fish thekkady along with neer dosa... what a combo loved it. Fish kundapur was very spicy but seriously good.. excellent taste..
