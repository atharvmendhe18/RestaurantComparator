Review
One of the best thaalis I have had. The quantity vs quality is bang on. It's clean. Service guys are nice and polite. And definitely value for money
"Here you get unlimited thali option, We went on a weekend for lunch.
It sounds grand but it's not. Per thali price was Rs.333 + taxes and I did not find the food worth that much, it was decent not great. A normal restaurant would serve same kind of thali at around Rs.200 per thali.
They should buckle up in terms of service and try to serve hot food even if it's been served 3rd or 4th time.
Things I loved Kadhi, Phulka & Panner curry.

Rating wise
Food 2.7/5
Service 2/5
Variety 4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
I won't comment about quantity as this is a place where you get unlimited food."
"Annpurna has the concept of vegetarian thali. This is something which is not new, but they are really doing a great job. The USP of this place is the price, 299 on weekdays and 333 on weekends + taxes which is really great as the quality of food you get for such a price is amazing. The menu keeps changing on a daily basis

The thali comprises of-
2 farsan- Samosa & Dhokla
2 rice dishes- Plain Rice & Khichdi
4 types of vegetables
2 daal
Dahi Bhalla
Fruit Custard
Roti and puri
2 desserts- Dudhi Halwa & Gulab Jamun
Chaas
Mint chutney
Sweet tamarind chutney
Salad

Just head to this place for a wholesome Gujarati- Rajasthani food experience.

p.s.- Avoid eating few hours prior going to this...read more"
"Annpurna is a vegetarian restaurant which serves amazing Rajasthani and Gujrati Thali's which tastes amazingly awesome at very affordable rates.The ambiance of this place is perfect with  different types of lighting and perfect seating arrangement.The service was up to the notch with amazing staff.

"Veg Thali restaurants is something I mostly avoid as they tend to focus more on the quantity than the quality of food.  Hence, on my 1st visit here a couple of months ago, I walked in with more than a hint of skepticism. It turned out to be better than my expectation though as the Farsan & Sweets taste and variety as well as the Dal Bati was good. Service was polite and courteous as is expected from Thali themed restaurants and the owner also made an attempt to check if we were satisfied with the food.  After a good 1st experience, decided to take my parents for lunch here after a couple of weeks; however this time both the menu was disappointing and food taste inconsistent as compared...read more"
"They have a Thali system here with no a la carte system. The thali inculdes

1 glass butter milk

2 farsans (mini samosa,sangam dhokla)

1 Dal bati

4 sabji's (paneer sopia, aloo mattar rassa, rajma punjabi ,bhendi masala)

2 dal ( gujarati dal & kadi, dal pashwar)

3 rotis (puri,rotla,pulka)

2 rice (steam rice, jeera rice)

2 desserts (malai sandwich,gulab jamun)

1 bottle water

the menu keeps changing everyday and the dishes arent repeated frequently. Its unlimited however there's a 10% penalty on wastage of food. 
The hospitality and ambience is pretty great and value for money is exercised.‚ù§ Taste is Too good
Service is Quick and Warm."
I had been here once and that once was enough. You do have really tasty options available in Vashi such Bhagat or Nanumal if you are veggie. The quality of food menus which ate served are not at par with their competition.
"Last night's dinner was at AnnPurna Shahi Dawat, Vashi.
We had a complete blast and ate a full fledged Gujarati meal wholeheartedly!

The Thaali consists of Dal Bhaati, Paneer Tikka Masala, Moong Masala, Biryani Dhokla, Mini Samosa, Aloo Rajwadi, Dal Dhokli, Gujarati Dal, Peshawari Dal, Baingan Bharta, Puris, Roti, Rice, Salad, Papad, Chaas and 2 varities of Sweet Dish.

Sevaiya Kheer and Jamun Halwa were last night's dessert speciality. However, the desert keeps varying on a daily basis.

And unbelievably this entire meal is UNLIMITED and only for Rs. 299/- üòç

For the food they serve and considering the ambiance, we would term it as a complete Family Restaurant which serves...read more"
"Annapurna Veg Restaurant or u can say Annapurna Thali Restaurant at Palm Beach Road in Satara Plaza, Vashi known for its Thali.

For me the ambience of this restaurant is ok but I really didn't like the concept of only having different types of Thali, Pulav & Pav Bhaji. I visited here today for the first time & inspite of ordering Thali I went for their Spl Pulav & found it disgusting. 1 or 2 family in restaurant were all ordering Thali only so next time I will also not repeat the mistake of ordering anything else. Many family skiped this hotel as options r only thali, pulav & Pav bhaji as nothing else is available. Coming back to Thali was looking huge with lots of options to have....read more"
"Excellent taste,outstanding service.
I've been here more than 4 times and the standards have only gone up.
The hygiene level has also been very well maintained."
"Not as accepted. Not pure Gujarati or Rajasthani test. I am not recommend, If you want then you can tray Maharaja thal next to 5 shops. :( :( :("
Awesome service loved the food as well as service...I guess one of the decent places for thali in navi mumbai hav also tried the near by compititor maharaja thali...ambiance wise it's better but services wasn't tht gr8...333 for one person quiet reasonable.
"Just a simple line ..Never Ever visit this place!! Its such a pathetic service, no curtsy to offer food like they are paying for us by providing food!! Even manager is not aware about of menu for the day and fumbling when we complained about food!! When I asked waiter about the food served to us angrily he confess that some of the items are not fresh they are from afternoon!! So guys so suggesting you dont even think of visiting this place!!"
"Thali is something I m damn crazy about, it's a compulsion for me to have it once a week as it has lot of varieties in it. So talking about this place I liked it especially chaas n rajma it was amazing. Will recommend surely :)"
I regularly visiting this place. Taste of each and every dish is awesome. The ambience is quit simple and beautiful. Love to visit this place again.
"It's awesome. Best place for vegetarian food ‚ò∫. Love that very much. Must go place. Different taste in each dish.
Best of luck to annapurna team."
"Wow, the thali was great and absolutely not oily and stuffy. Great taste and variety. Beautiful decor and ambience. Will be back for sure! Value for money!
Food-5/5
Service-4/5 ( Not so quick as they keep reheating the food, which is a great thing!!)
Ambience-4/5
Prices-4.5/5

Great job!"
"I always enjoy the unlimited thali restaurants so when i read about annpurna, was eager to try it.Although I passed by it many times ,never knew its a thali restaurant

Reached around 1 at the restaurant was almost empty. The service took some time to start but once the food started coming,the service was quite prompt

First came salads and chutneys. Then starters and papad. Starters were moong dal pakoda and khandvi. Both were tasty. Then the veggies- there were 4 veggies - all were good. Then came dal fry and sweet kadhi. Desserts were malai sandwich and sheera. The chapatis were nice and fluffy and puris nice and crisp. Although was full by this time, had little rice with dal. Lastly...read more"
Visited with family and we are truly amazed with the changes they have brought in their preparation....Now they are not restricting themselves to Rajasthani and Gujrati dishes only...They have included some Punjabi dishes too and we loved this change...Restaurant owner himself taking care of the guest and was very open to take feedback...Nice experience will visit again for sure...
"Been here for first time, ambience is really worth & food serve is also quite ok.
On feed back ( as foodie) i would suggest that they shud come up with some more spice gujarati dishes like undhiu & sev tameta  rabadi jalebi and all...Cheers"
"The ambience was good, infact the owner was personally attending to the guests and ensuring that we were served properly. Waiters were very warm and attentive. The food was excellent and worth the cost. The thali has everything in right proportion. The unlimited experience  really good for the foodies. 
I would definitely recommend all...... worth going and better than other Thali restaurants... 
To sum it up it was an awesome experience together!!!! :-)"
This is an Unlimited Thali Place in Vashi near Palm Beach Galleria. This place is really good in terms of ambience but their food lacks somethings. Its averagely priced and the food is average as well. It promises Rajasthani Cuisine whereas nothing tastes Rajasthani over there(Im a Rajasthani).. Would recommend people to try but only if you are not Rajasthani as you will be let down.
"The moment u think about enjoying an unlimited thali, u bound to search a thali place.. On one such day, I came upon this place.

The decor looks classy and the service is swift. However, while it fulfills the unlimited thali requirement it lacks the authenticity of Gujarati n rajasthali thali.

Lot many things on the plate to fill ur stomach but nothing that makes u enjoy n relish the food."
"Amazing home cook food ,excellent ambiance,reasonable rate . Wow !!!! Loved it . Will definitely try again and again ,and will recommend other friends too ."
"Annpurna truly fills the void for a great thali experience in marijuana. It has great food, ambience & amazing service which makes up for a great dining experience. The interest shown by the owners is exceptional & makes you feel special. I would recommend this place for outing with friends & family. A big thumbs up."
"Fantastic service with good quality tasty food, me and my family would definitely recommend to people who in search of good food.
I had a visit with my family for a try and  was amazed with the food and service.
I will get back there with my whole family. 

Definitely better than those where I have been till date for  Rajesthani & Gujurati thali ."
Food is excellent. They serve food in unlimited thali format and you can opt on which dish u like the most..The price is below 400 and they serve immediately. Bisleri water is complimentary. Parcel of food also can be done in a box with optional for 1-2-4 ppl. Ambiance is good. They also have hotel in dubai and abudhabi....Must visit place for vegetarians.üòÉ
"Annpurna means ""the giver of food and nourishment"" as described by the wiki page for the Goddess, and being named after the said goddess who, as per Hindu religious texts, is responsible for providing ""full, complete and perfect food"", Annpurna, the restaurant, has set itself out to do just that - providing nourishing, scrumptious and filling meals to its patrons in the form of a 'thali', which they prepare with a Rajasthani twist.

I had visited Annpurna with a huge group from our residential society as a part of our annual dinner program for all of the members. The entrance, with its facade of glass and intricately carved panels immediately catches your eye, and the...read more"
A must visit place for a vegetarian in Navi Mumbai... Sabudana wada is the best here and so is the dahi wada... Will definitely come here again.
It's a typical gujrati-rajasthani thali restaurant. I happened to be at one in Hyderabad a month ago and I don't see much of a difference between the two. I like the Hyderabad one more maybe because it ambience and all is also according to the theme. The food here is like any thali place. Maybe the servers could describe what is being served so I know what I'm eating. Nothing specific about this place. I was kinda expecting a lot and I'm a wee bit disappointed! :(
"Visited this place today, as per the reviews I saw there was nothing unique but wasn't bad experience.
This place serves thali which is a mix of few gujrati n more of rajasthani cuisine, which I was not aware of.
They served peru drink that was so refreshing, totally love it, taste of guava was so soothing n pleasant, thali starts with dhokla, a pea filled kachori, variety of chutney 4 they have, rice frym and papad, also they serve 8 bowls in which they serve 6 with sabji n all, and in two they serve gulab jaamun, and shrikhand, along they serve dal baati, (sad they serve crushed baati) additional is Chach. In breads they serve roti, poori, and rotla, in rice they give 3 options.

I visited this place for marwadi thali and was very happy with the food. Although a bit spicy we really enjoyed the variety. Staff is very courteous.
"I was here with my family during my visit to India. Loved each and every item in the thali, specially dal bati and malpua. The malpua was so delicious that it melted in mouth. Their Sitafal basundi was wonderful. Kadi khichadi was also a very tasty combination. Overall the quality was very good and a kind of divinity of the food matched the name of the restaurant . Would love to visit again and again"
Amazing food with lots of variety. Ambience is superb. New and different food items everytime as compared to other thali restaurants . Quality is also great with pure ghee loved it. Service is good. Loved the masala dhokla and halwa. Overall experience: superb
"i visited this restaurant with my family, but let me tell you the price what they are charging and quality of food what they are offering is worst, no good taste, no good variety of vegetables and no good quality of sweets , also chapati quality is very poor, using all third class ingredients ...fooling new mumbai people, people want taste & quality not your interior decoration.

pls. send ur chef to eat for one week at rajdhani and golden star thali restaurant in town - mumbai and then let them serve us in navi mumbai.

i advice all navi mumbai people do not visit this restaurant , navi mumbai does not have even a single good thali restaurant...only visit to mumbai if u really want...read more"
"Being a gujarati thali lover, i was happy that finally vashi got back its gujarati thali option after rajdhani closed. The restaurant and the ambience looked pretty nice to begin with and that was it...it was as if the movie trailer looked brilliant and once you go to watch the movie, its bakwaas. Dont go by the looks and ambience of the restaurant as the food and service sucks big time..nothing great about the taste to write about...we even got under cooked rice ...would you believe it and they were serving it still to other tables after we complaining it to them.staff service is even worse...this was the story during our first visit and we were told that its some festival back in...read more"
"Had been there on 11th June 2015. It's a newly opened place, so we thought of exploring it on a friend's birthday.

Food quality: Didn't like it much, didn't appear and taste fresh.

Food spread: Was good enough to be called a thali place

Staff: very polite and friendly

Ambience: very good

Price: Very reasonable

Verdict: doesn't even match Rajdhani standards, not going to try it again."
"Finally, we have a good Thali Restaurant in Vashi. Ever since Panchvati's exit from Inorbit Vashi, there was a need for a good Thali joint. Annapurna has variety and taste. The only missing part is the quality of service staff. When you write Rajasthani Thali, it must come with the Rajasthani custom. Leave that apart, it's a great restaurant. I know that I am going to visit thus place many times with my family and friends."
"We just finished our dinner here and trust me when I say this. Not even one dish of the entire thali spread was respectable enough to enjoy. Also, so noisy and mayhemish. With comptt around such as Nanumal, Bhagatchand, Maharaja etc in the vicinity, this place ought to vanish in max 3 months. Please avoid."
"Went with 10 people last night. Other than the rates of mainstream players like Rajdhani & Maharaja Bhog, nothing else matches up. Absolutely nothing.
Chaas was sour, the rose flavoured welcome drink was nice though. We were served all the food, desserts etc, but no roti/ puri for 10 minutes. Each time, we had to literally call out for it. Thali eating is supposed to less conservation led and more eating led. Here it was the opposite. Not one dish is worth a mention, except the desserts which were good, but then can't consume them alone. The gap between the tables was also pretty much less (maybe to maximise carpet area), which meant that every time the neighbour table was to served, we...read more"
"A mix of Gujrati and Rajasthani thali they say, but apart from the variety they maintain on the menu, its nothing great. Compare this with experience at Panchawati Gaurav or Rajdhani, the service is totally messed up. Starters are below average. Dal bati just ok. Buttermilk and Raita was sour in both our visits. Other than khichadi, the only good thing is Aamras, but isn't that because of good Mango's..??? 

Thought of giving benefit of doubt the first time, but 2nd time, it should be stamped. Not worth the money..!!"
"A Gujarati Rajasthani thali place. It's a mix of both. Visited the place with family for Mother's Day. The staff is courteous. The food is okay. No reason to complain. But nothing to rave about either. Not one dish in the entire thali stood out for a special mention. Except in some parts the Aamras. But I must mention my huge bias for aamras. They serve 500 litres of it over sat sun I'm told.
It's a place u can visit when in the craving for a Gujarati Thali, cause there aren't many options in the vicinity.
They need to work on the taste."
"Went to this place few weeks after it had opened in Vashi, interiors are fine,and only unlimited thali is available. It had many varieties in the thali but I would suggest them, may be reduce some options and concentrate on quality and taste.
I would say the authenticity of rajasthani taste was very much missing.
But over all it is ok"
"I think it is the only place in Vashi to have Rajasthani thali. To be frank expected a little better food. Have visited better places before around India which serves better Rajasthani thaliss
But still it was good experience.
The main USP was `Amaras` with the start of Mango seaaon. Dal bati was ok. Phulke sabji and other sweets were good.
Went on weekend for dinner.

Overall good...!"
"Been there, the very next day it opened. By the looks of it, it seemed a fantastic place to have a thali like Rajdhani, Panchvati Gaurav or Maharaja Bhog.
