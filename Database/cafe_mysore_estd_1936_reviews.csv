"I visited this place on 26th Jan on the morning of Republic day for a wholesome breakfast. The place was crowded and we got the table after 15mins
I tried their Podi Idli which was smooth and had a good taste.
I really loved their Mysore masala dosa which was spot on along with coconut chutney"
My favorite joint for south indian snacks since childhood

THERE WAS NO CHUTNEY WITH MY ORDER ... DIDNT EXPECT THIS BEHAVIOUR FROM RESTAURANT AND WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE RESTAURANT FIRST THEY WERE NOT SURE IF THIS ORDER IS SEND BY THEM THEN THEY REFUSE TO AGREE THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEND CHUTNEY AND STARTED BLAMING ZOMATO DELIVERY ..LATER THEY SAID PLEASE COME TO PICK UP IF YOU WANT OR SEND ZOMATO GUY WE WILL NOT SEND.. DELIVERY MAN WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GET BACK TO RESTAURANT AND GET IT FOR US.. IT DOESN'T END HERE AFTER SENDING THE ZOMATO GUY THEY AGAIN REFUSED SAYING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ORDER ..SO BUT WE KNEW THE NAME OF PERSON WE WERE SPEAKING TO THEN THEY AGREED AND SEND IT ..NOT THE EXPERIENCE I WOULD EXPECT AFTER PAYING FOR 1000RS ORDER...
