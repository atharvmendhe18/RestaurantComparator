"Tavola impress me with their mouthwatering sizzlers that serves with options of 4 different sauces we tried the barbecue one and it was delicious , prompt service, and lively atmosphere. The staff was friendly, the ambience inviting, and the live screening added extra entertainment. It was an overall fantastic experience that I highly recommend!"
Lot of oil in the chinese starters â€¦ hence plz control â€¦
Too thick naan and too watery gravy- had to search chicken
"delicious food, i have tried many dishes, & my favorite is green thai curry."

very very bad taste the biryani was very cold and restaurant staff is very rude
Rs1400/- plus we paid but food not upto the mark
"pathetic food. they cannot even prepare a basic soup. we returned monchow soup due to excess soya sauce, ordered tomato soup thinking it will be good but the tomato soup was just cornstarch and water. And they donâ€™t even have the courtesy they billed us for both soup 492."
"was little sweet this time, usually this is a good dish"

"Itâ€™s a bit soupy. I was expecting the delhi style chowmein which is orangish in color and spicy and dry.

But this one is also nice."

"I had ordered paneer tikka masala.
It was very bland and taste was pathetic.
There was only color added in the vegetable.

"I placed order on ~8:45 pm and I got order delivery on 10:20 pm. food was ready since 9:30 PM but delivery partner kept with him for around 1 hr to get another food pick up from different restaurant. Received food in cold condition, no taste no feel. thanks for spoiling my 31st. god bless you."

"I had read the reviews on Zomato and decided to call for delivery. The food was horrible and way too overpriced.

Veg noodle soup: this was the worst noodle soup ever. The uses regular noodles and made it like chowmein. Had to throw it in the dustbin.

Chicken Yakhni soup: this was basically small pieces of chicken in a red gravy. Had to throw this too.

Naan: was paper thin and crisp so it was too chewey

Chicken kolapuri: it was very basic and had only 4 small pieces of chicken. All other restaurants give 6 pieces. For â‚¹350 I expect more.

Overall a very bad experience and i don't think I will ever eat from this place again."

"Ambience & Service was Great, but it is expensive in terms of food they serve, Over all Ok place to have dine & chill"
"This place is divided into 3 sections : Outdoor dining, Indoor Family section and indoor bar section (Although you can order drinks in the family section too)
We had ordered Chicken Achari kabeb, Mutton Kheema and Naan roti.
Although the kabeb was a bit too tangy than it should have been, the Mutton Kheema was yummy and perfect.
The Indoor section is the best fit incase you plan to visit this place with family and the outdoor one is the perfect one with friends.
The rates are not over the top too. This place is worth giving a try!"
I just ordered nachos at this place and nothing else as I was in a hurry and didn't have much time. Nothing so great about nachos here but the ambience and decor of this restaurant is creative. Not much crowded you can come at this place anytime to have a good decent family dinner. I look upon to visit this restaurant next time for a better review.
This restaurant is really good if you like to have different varieties of dishes both for Veg and Non-veg. The ambiance is great and the service too is quite good. However this place is not cheap and might dig a hole in your walletðŸ˜ƒ. Overall this is a good place to dine and try different dishes with no compromise on quality
"This is a fine dine Restaurant, also have live singer performance on weekends or special holidays.
Nice variety of food they offer in menu. We had cheese rolls in veg they crispy and cheese perfect taste. in non veg chicken tikka, platter, butter chicken was top notch in taste. main course biryani was less in quantity but tasty. also tried few cocktails, they were not best but okay. place is pricey if you are drinking and trying cocktails like us then it gonna cost you very much. great ambiance good for family crowd as well as friends and big family gatherings. they also host birthday parties. and place is big enough to accomodate large groups.
5 stars for ambience
4 for cleanliness

Service was too slow was not upto the mark at all. The Naans and Rotis are too expensive.. The quantity of food is not as per the rates though the taste was good.
""
We were a group of girls and had gone for dinner but the staff kept asking us to lower the volume ..how can u expect a group of 9 coming out for dinner put finger on there lips and eat dinner ...don't know what was the expectation of the staff ...The hotel staff should clearly mention large group not allowed ... Not at all recommended for groups
"Visited this place on Monday for lunch...
We ordered mastani kebab, Kung pao potato and drums of heaven.
Chicken was cooked to perfection, Kung pao potato was not that great quite disappointed
Attentive staff and a pretty decent ambience

Service - 3.5/5
Food - 3/5
Quantity - 3.5/5
Ambience - 4/5"
"May be I am wrong,but if I were wrong I wouldn't post this review.
We ordered some Chinese starters which were not chinese actually, It was kind of tandoori stuff with some spring onion and bellpepers.

The food had so much of oil that if USA got to know they would invade and raise a war on the starters.

Thought the main course was really good, the chicken burnt garlic rice and some black bean gravy (I dont know what it was but whatever it was,it was worth)

A good place with a decent crowd and humble staff."
Pathetic food was served ! Having a bad stomach ache and loose motions ! Please do not visit this restaurant if u wish to keep good health ! The manager is dumb he doesnâ€™t have any knowledge of the stuff being served he acts as if heâ€™s drunk ! Highly disappointed
"It's a really good place to go out with your family. Staff is really courteous and the decor is pleasant.

Food - 5/5 really didn't expect such tasty food. We ordered
1. Chicken Munchow soup - it was perfect
2. Hot garlic chicken - Super Chinese dish
3. Chicken mastani kebab - Medium spicy and full of flavour.
4. Chicken hakka noodle - It was good

Drinks - 5/5 had ordered Virgin mojito...

Overall a very pleasant experience and had a good time with my family ðŸ˜Š"
