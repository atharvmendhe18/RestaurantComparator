"Chicken was not tender , Naan was hard. Seems this is fake restaurant using name of Avanti."
"I think this restaurant is fake using same name as real Avanti. chicken tandoori was from stale chicken, taste was ordinary. Delivery was late. No more orders going to this restaurant from me."

"chicken amritsari was okayish it was just like homecooked nothing special

Mutton chef Signature was sweet in taste..didn't went well...expected it to be medium spicy atleast..rest all good
Chicken was not fresh.
oil is too much beyond imagination. if needed pls take it back. we used to order from Avanthi but never again. this is after we removed a layer of oil from it. still there is a whole layer. we have mixed it also still so much oil and barely any curry. we have had this before also but the quality is bad this time

"I went here for my parents anniversary.
As this is a hotel they have their restaurant on the ground floor. This place is near Mangatram Petrol pump just 10min from Kanjurmarg station.

This place has a very subtle vibes. This is a perfect place for family dinners and celebrations.

Coming towards food, I ordered :
Dragon rolls - 8/10
Chicken mumtaz - 10/10 The chicken was really cooked well and it was so tender.
Veg Maharaja - 8/10
Sizzling brownie - 10/10

The main course was not full of spices which was a good thing because most of the restaurants put a lot of spices, oil and stuff to enhance the taste but here it was so simple yet delicious.

This place is not too expensive so you can...read more"
"I not got garlic bread which come with pasta
and pasta possion is very small acodoing to other restaurants

very nice value for money 💰"

Paneer was not good. Too creamy and smooth.
"The tomato soup that I received from your restaurant was horribly sweet, and it is my understanding that tomato soup is not supposed to be sweet. As an adult, I expect a certain level of sophistication in the food that I am served, and this soup did not meet my expectations.

I was surprised to find out that sugar was mixed into the soup. Who mixes sugar into soup? This is a highly unusual and unnecessary ingredient that completely alters the taste of the soup. People are cutting off sugar from their diets, even in things that are traditionally supposed to be sweet, like tea. It's baffling that you would add sugar to soup.

I urge you to reconsider your recipe for tomato soup and...read more"

Little spicy then precious one which we ordered.
Will not order again. Tasteless Food. Worst experience. 😡😡😡😡
Avanti is best place for family and friends. Their chicken platter is so good in taste. cocktails and mock tail are also good with good prices and quality
the mutton was overcooked and rubbery. the gravy virtualy has no taste. it's supposed to succulent meat in a thick gravy
"Avanti Multi-Regional Family Restaurant & Bar is situated at LBS Road Bhandup West near Mangatram Petrol Pump. The restaurant has a huge seating capacity, beautiful decor & a pleasant ambience. As the name suggests it's a multi-regional restaurant thus offers a wide range of food options to choose from. The menu was moderately priced.👈

In starter, We ordered Veg Cripsy, Paneer Tikka, Veg Seekh Kabab followed by Paneer Shashlik Sizzler. For Main Course, We opted Veg Kadhai, Veg Hyderabadi & Rotis. Sizzling Brownie was our dessert.😋

Everything tasted awesome. The staff was polite & service was excellent. Overall, a recommended restaurant in Bhandup West.👌👍"

Tandoori Chicken is very juicy & tasty. Salad also good

"I visited this place twice and my experience was not that great. the first time I ordered veg starters and it took 40 minutes and it was cold when i asked the waiter regarding the cold food he took that food and oven heated and bought. The food was not at all tasty. Not worth of having a veg meal here.
Their non-veg food is expensive as per the quantity is concerned but non veg meals/food does taste good. The waiters are helpful and polite no complaints there.
The matter here is quantity and quality of the food. I can't forget that the chicken was smelling (wierd)

There are definitely good restaurants out there. This is not recommendable at all
CHEERS"
I had ordered for paya soup but this looks like a gravy. I want my money back

"Egg Biryani is a must-try recipe for all egg lovers as it promises to take your love for eggs to another level altogether. Egg Biryani is a wholesome meal that will satisfy both your hunger and your taste buds. Also known as Anda Biryani in India, this dish is made by cooking together fragrant long grain basmati rice, spiced hard boiled eggs curry, perfectly caramelized onions and select aromatic spices, delighting your senses in every bite.
I like this briyani ❤️"
Paya Soup is pathetic. It was just a curry. Hardly there was one small piece of mutton bone which was not giving any flavour of mutton soup. Please don't order Paya Soup.

Ordered Veg Biryani and got cockroach for free.. worst experience and food pathetic.
"I’ve visited this restaurant since it was newly opened. More than 10 times for sure. It is a bit expensive but totally worth it. Usually I don’t like to eat seafood from any restaurant. But this restaurant served fresh seafood and I totally loves it. If you are out with family, you can order veg/fish/chicken sizzler. It is amazing and worth all the penny you pay
