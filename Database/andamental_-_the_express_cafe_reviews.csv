I had ordered Murgh seekh kebab and it was just amazing.. It was one of the bestt kebabs that i personally have tasted. I had visited two of their outlets before but never got a chance to actually try the kebabs..This time i tried them and it was worth my time. I am in love with this restaurant.. and definitely recommending this to my relatives who stays nearby any of their outlets. The price is affordable and the food is delivered quick and hot. The chicken used is very fresht and the spices are in right amount...

"I have always been a maggie lover. The day I ordered the cheese and egg maggie I was not sure how it was going to taste. But to my surprise, it was nicely packed and when opened the box there were loads of cheese on the top. The taste was super yum. This has now become my go-to place for all egg-related dishes. Must try

Cheers!"
Just loved the egg biryani that we tried here. Not spicy and perfect to taste!
Place is cramped & service staff don't respond after bringing the food to the table. Take out is a better option.
Food was pungent and oily. This was one of the good spots to order anda biryani. I would love for them to improve.

"I met with a friend closer to azad nagar metro station. We have been to some of the restaurant's nearby so thought of visiting a new one. Andamental is a cute little restaurant which is just a few steps away from azad nagar metro.
Egg lovers have a lot to cherish. Street side anda bhurji was the best dish we tried.  Biryani was good and so was andamental maggi."
"I will give anda star to andamental food. 0 star beacuse taste and quality was anda 0

Will never repeat andamental total disappointment"
"Ordered a brocolli roll and street style egg bhurji from this place. The roll was surprisingly good although I wish they could offer wheat base option.
The egg bhurji was healthy and delicious. They also sent two paos which weren't mentioned in the description. We couldn't use them though.
Suggestion- pls include that in description/ add that as an option able item. :)"

"I generally order from here for my late night hunger. Last night I ordered Anda vada pav omelette, after couple of bites i realize there is a broken plastic container piece in my mouth. I was fortunate that it was a bit big otherwise I would have swallowed it. Not done guys. Pls keep a check on your contents & quality."
"Zomato delivered fast as usual
Ordered Luknowi Anda Curry with Pav
Nice taste right masala 2 eggs Boiled but alas too oily
Pav were too small resulting in lots of curry being left over which in turn results in a half empty stomach"
Awesome restaurant. Superb service. Very quick. Staff is very good. Delivery was fast. Food waa hot and fresh.
"Anda Bhurji Rice - really sad !
Order # 2044992232
Sent clear cooking instructions to put less rice, as I suspected the 2-egg bhurji, would get lost in a large quantity of rice.
I like my food with enough ingredients, vegetables, eggs or whatever is main - without too much rice or noodles
Number was unreachable, so also confirmed via Zomato valet that they understood what was requested for. They said Yes !
Now, I‚Äôm stuck with All rice and specs of bhurji.
I‚Äôm like, how difficult is to understand simple instructions & follow them?
Seriously disappointing !!"
"Hi Folks!
This place is small. The light are very dim.
They have small seating available.
i ordered Aloo achari wrap and it was sour and bit spicy.
The size was big and was quick meal.
I also order panner bhurji and naan. it was well grind.
I also tried their ice tea.
overall it was lovely to dine with andamental.
Rating -4/5"
"The food is decent. However, there is literally no place to sit. I would recommend a takeout than a dine in. Order the Afghani anda curry and enjoy."
"This is a short and simple place where you can find N number of Egg content.
Wall are decorated and they have live counter downstairs.
Whatever they make you can clearly see them.
I order panner wrap and it was heavy and sufficient . The juiciness and the panner content was hight. Highly recommendable.
Also tried out panner burji and naan roti. it was also the good one.
Lastly tried out their exotic vegi biryani.
Overall the experience was good.
only one thing they can change is the ventilation.

"Andamental is located in Andheri West. Its near to Andheri Sports Club.

The outlet is small & has few tables for seating. It decorated with egg quotes & prints.

The menu focuses EGG as their main ingredient. Every dish here has egg. Price wise its pocket friendly.

What We Had -
Starters ~
Cheese Anda Baida Roti -
Paneer Bhurji Roll -
Both the starters were good. The masalas in it was perfect. Green chutney served with the dishes was great.

MAINS ~
The Andamental Ghotala.
Tawa Anda Pulav.
Both the mains was heavy & flavourful. The quantity is good & quality as well.

So this place is must for an egg lover. Do give it a try."
"Visited this place one fine evening with a cousin.
We wanted to chill and this was the most nearby cafe.

We liked the food. But it could have been better.

We ordered
1- Mumbai Vada Pav Omelette- This was good to taste. But there was only slight taste of vada and it mostly tasted like Omelette pav

2-Chicken Mental Maggie- It was good. And worth a try.

3-Classic Cold Coffee
4-Lemon Iced Tea

Sadly these 2 were only available that time.
We would have loved to have shakes or something. But they weren't available."
"It is a small outlet located just outside Azad nagar metro station. They have variety of egg dishes.
First we had Lemon Iced Tea as there was nothing else available. It was fine.

China town anda roll - It was really good. It had both taste of both Chinese and Egg. It has noodles and vegetables stuffed in it along with egg. Highly recommended.

Afghani Chicken Masala - It was a mouthwatering dish. Thick gravy of Chicken with Cheese added on it. We had this dish with roasted paav. Highly recommended.

Andamental Biryani - It had 4 half pieces of boiled egg. It tasted fine.

There are many dishes in this restaurant, you can give it a try!"
"A perfect place to visit for all egg lovers the variety of dishes they provide in egg is really interesting and the taste is certainly one of the best.

Ordered the following
4 eggs white omelette
Turkish omelette
Cheese anda baida roti roll (must try)
Chinatown anda roll
Paneer lababdar roll
Andamental biryani (must try)

The taste is excellent and the staff is helpful overall a good place to be at"
