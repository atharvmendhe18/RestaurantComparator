The biryani was absolutely bland. No flavor and it felt like I am eating boiled chicken. The rice had a funky flavor to it.

"I ordered Egg biryani, they send me mixture of tawa pulav and schezwan fried rice."
Chicken portion size small and there were small hairs in my paratha
"chicken curry should improve as it was little smelling.
Over all food was yummy."
Got two veg rolls for chicken Manchurian
"I
Order 2 times but food quality and test was zero, quantity they give but if talking about test worthless, this is my opinion, whenever have biryani feel like grass we having no taste atall"
Neer does is rubber dosa….
The food was amazing 😋
taste wasn't good. tasted more like veg pulav rather than veg biryani
