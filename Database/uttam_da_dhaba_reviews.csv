Do not make the mistake of ordering an overpriced Fondue unless you want white sauce instead of cheese and bread stuffed in the candle holder of the fondue set. Strictly stick to Indian food which is far better!
everything was cold and the mutton bhuna was full of bones with 2 peices wich were not cooked properly feels like raw mutton doesn't liked it
"Absolutely tasteless and overpriced place. I feel they have been so lost in making the exterior of the restaurant better, that they have forgotten to pay attention to make the most important thing in a restaurant ‚Äúfood‚Äù. Places like global fusion and stables offer a buffet for two people in 1600-2000."

Not that great when it comes to Chinese
"Just visited this place with 7 others had ordered Rogan Josh, Paneer Saagwaala for main course. The started was chewy and the gravys were tasteless. Something as basic as lassi was not great. Very disappointed üòû
Also the menu added in Zomato is a fake one. The pricing of dishes is much higher"

"This was the best biryani i had in mumbai but do you really sell that gulab jamun in rs.245. If so, what makes it so expensive cause it tasted the same. Also, what is about that small amount of raita for 2 biryanis."
Gulabjamun was missing

"A place I would recommend for both families and friends. It has different sections for bar and dining, so you can choose according to your purpose of visit.
The food is exceptionally tasty with a wide range of options. Both veg and non veg dishes are equally good.
Recommended dish would be Mushroom Ghee Roast."
The food is very good.I have been eating their dal fry since 20 years and the taste has not changed. Highly recommended
This place is great to hang out. I loved the setup and vibe of this place. Food menu has got plenty of option to try and all that we ate was super yummy.
"I recently dined at the newly revamped Uttam da Dhaba in Marol, Andheri East, and it exceeded my expectations. With a range of dining options all under one roof, it's a versatile choice for various occasions. The main restaurant's aesthetic appeal is perfect for those Instagram-worthy moments, while the Dhaba section adds a rustic charm to the experience. ""Fly,"" their lounge, provides a relaxing space, and the Kesar Banquets are a great choice for special events.

For starters, we enjoyed the Banjara Kabab and Chicken Chakori Kabab (highly recommend) which were bursting with flavors. The Desi Romance and California Emita mocktails perfectly complemented our meal. The lasooni...read more"
"Today I visited this restaurant for dinner. The food quantity was less and it took a really long time for the food to come. One glass of coke costed ‚Çπ100 which I personally felt pricey for no reason.
The naan was delicious and soft tho.
It‚Äôs a one time visit place."
"Uttam Da Dhaba has recently been renovated. was very eager to go there and happy with my decision.

Ordered Tandoori Chicken and Dal Makhani which they are very good at.

Nice ambience and attentive service.

Horrible and late service plus they brought us the wrong order and charged us extra amount in the bill which they didn't even serve us. The owner was also rude inspite of being their mistake.

Took more than an hour for the food to be delivered; bad service!
"I am a regular customer of Uttam Da Dhaba since last one decade. I had placed an order for Murg Makhanwala for home deliveryon 24/02/2022 On receiving the same I was surprised to fine that 25% of the chicken was not cooked properly, as it was hard to bite. I had to throw away more than 50%. I had called up your restaurant informing of the same. He told me that I should have phoned. How can I phone when I was on my dining table. I requested him to look into the matter & revert to me. But It is sad to note that till today I have not received any call niether any feedback. Can't expect this from Uttam Da Dhaba."
"As always, Great taste and excellent quality. Athi Uttam ü§ó"
