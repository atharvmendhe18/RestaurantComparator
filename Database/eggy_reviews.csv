Review
"Definitely NEVER ORDERING from this place again. Had placed an order at 1 AM and it was delivered at 3 AM!! And even when the order came it was COLD. The food was way too spicy. The whole point of ordering food online is to NOT HAVE TO WAIT for 2 hours for it to deliver and definitely not have it cold.
Terrible food and service!"
Did not like the rice item. Doesn't look fresh. Kheema was also jus average.
"Interestingly made dishes, very nicely packed but the extremely heavy spice (the salad was unpalatably spicy) and the delivery time ruins it all.

At 1235 am, the order took exactly 90 minutes. Not cool for something literally down the road."
"Really really pathetic attitude of the restaurant owner and Zomato agent. Have been a regular customer of Eggy but won't order ever again. Zomato mentions quantity of paratha as 2 (refer image) but their agent and the restaurant say it's actually 1. Ridiculous. I have ordered from here before and always received 2. This time they forgot and instead of admitting, started giving nonsense reasons"
