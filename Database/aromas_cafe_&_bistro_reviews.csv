instructions
taste was too salty and too much mustard
Requested w/o Mushrooms...but they added Mushrooms
It is one of the few places which serves alcohol and coffee throughout the day along with decaf. Respect it. And the food is decent what else can you ask for.
Could have been better packaging for the pasta

"A good Cafe in Powai for healthy breakfast and other dishes. Ambience is really good. We ordered Big breakfast or English breakfast. Egg, sausages and mushroom were good. I didn't like baked beans as it was processed and much sweeter. Sandwich was good. Oats omlette was thick and tasty. Waffle was perfectly sweet. Prices are bit higher. Overall a good experience."

chicken pieces less than expected
Very thick bread

Had specifically asked for oat/Soy milk in the drink because I'm allergic. but instead came with milk which flared a reaction on my face.

"Aroma's usually makes good food, lovely taste and quality which is why I have been ordering from them. But I was very disappointed with this order. In the Honey Mustard & Lemon chicken, neither the chicken nor the veggies were well cooked. Taste was very average of both dishes, including of the Spagetti. I wonder if the quality of the cafe has deteriorated as I haven't ordered from them for a while. But this order was very disappointing!"

Pasta sauce tastes of refined flour than cheese.
This is the worst part of our holidays. My wife and toddler are still recovering from the food poisoning they have after consumption of the food items.

"I had a bad experience for dinner with family. Ordered White pasta for my kid and it was too salty so I asked for a replacement, The order came again and it did not have mushrooms in it so I had to return it again. Did not expect this and service was very poor.

Ordered brownie in the desert and even brownie quality was not good."
