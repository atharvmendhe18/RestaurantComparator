"Always liked the taste of the items served by Shree Sagar, particularly the sambar, which has the unique Udupi flavour."
""
No salt in the Dosa.
The quantity is so less. Even the container is only three fourth full. Complete waste of money. Will never order from here again.
No Salt at all .. Average taste

"I would add 0 ratings as bad service, bad food & no proper ambience. Reminds of old times. Wont visit again.

Ordered for pizza, chinese bhel and idli. Chinese bhel was told to make non spicy but it was over spicy.

Service was the worst. Had to call multiple times but waiters and Stewards were both lazy as hell. Working as if doing a favour on customers.

Reminds me of earlier shree sagar where food and service both pathetic."
Very stale medu wadas. Looks like the previous days wadas were fried again and sent to us. Pathetic quality
The veg handi had rotten smell
tasteless
"Was here for Lunch with my In-Laws. Simple and cozy ambience. We had Roti Sabzi. All veggies had a different but Unique taste. Tried Mushroom Mutter Masala, Bhindi do Pyaza and Veg kolhapuri. And Jira rice n Dal tadka. Very Good portions. Finished off with their self proclaimed desert speciality. Strawberry IceCream with Fresh cream. Prices are reasonable. Had a good experience. Will love to visit again if halted at Bandra."
