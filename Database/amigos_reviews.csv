Review
Have not been to the place or had food there... But for Home delivery these guys take more than an hour to deliver food... Even if the delivery place is 5 mins away!! Never ordering from this place... Bad experience
"HI to all the foodies!
I must admit that this restaurant is one of the finest i have come across.
It's odd at times to see how people exercise their freedom of speech...but i intend to be unbiased.

The taste of the authentic Indian food is awesome! The take away (parcel) is very neatly packed,
it is spill free. The pilot who delivers is right on time.

You would be comforted to know that I certainly found this establishment to be worth to invest so much thought,
as it deserves to be fantastic. And of all the hospitality, the owner, Mr. Vinay seemed to be a genuine hotelier
who can cater not only good food but also courtesy.

I have tasted all the items enlisted in their menu.

So go for...read more"
Water served is not good. HALF OF THE ITEMS ARE NOT SERVED WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE MENU
"Had a great time at amigos! The pizza is delicious...its different from what u get...and the paneer was super soft, loved it.
It's a cool place to go and is very quiet.. Also the outdoor seating is pretty cool. I would definitely visit the place again."
"the good:
must try: pizzas - the margherita reminded me of what i'd eaten in Italy; amigos special is good for those whole like zuchhini and lots of cheese and exotica's pretty good, too. i thoroughly enjoy the fusilli in pesto. hummus with pita is served with nice, warm bread but it's a little on the sweet side. the burrito bowl and quesadilla are yum healthy options. pav bhaji is good, too. the paneer is very soft usually, decor is quaint and hygiene levels are good. kudos to the chef.

on the downside, i didn't like the punjabi at all. besides, the waiters are pretty clueless.

suggestion: add sizzlers to the menu. pretty much the only thing missing, and we don't get a lot of good veg...read more"
"Awesome quality and taste... Open roof setting in a quite suburban area... And reasonably priced too... Must try the sandwiches and pastas... Some of the best in town...


----- 28 Dec, 2013 -----

Awesome quality of food and not very expensive... Got positive response from staff too, although they were a bit slow... Must try the panini sandwiches..."
Tried out a pizza and some other stuff. Not good at all
"Amigos... Well a pleasant looking restaurant... Had been there on sat night at 10.45pm arounds... Only one another table was occupied other than ours...

1. Drinks: 3.5/5
Drinks are pretty cheap... Any drink and you pay 85. We tried the orignal mojito and strawberry margrita.
Strawberry margrita was a better choice though.

2. Food: 3.5/5
We started with corn cheese balls with dip, they were fabulous delicate crispy balls if sheer cheesy taste
Moving ahead we ordered a cheese and mushroom pasta it was good but the pastas were underboiled leaving them slightly undercooked. We did inform the staff regarding this but they politely acted helpless (had this not been the case they would had...read more"
"Very bad staff ....guys who answers the calls doesn't understand any thing you order in addition
they never pay proper attention to the order
Most of the time they avoid and ignore you.
you need to have at least 30 min to place an order for 2.
Very bad experience."
"Great food, quaint establishment...
Good value for money
Difficult to find the place though"
"A cute little restaurant with an interesting yet extremely affordable menu. the best thing about this place is surely the ambiance. It looks exactly like a street side cozy outlet that you would find on the roads of Goa or probably European countries! The mexican and italian dishes wre quite delicious and on a breezy evening, you can enjoy a quiet and satisfying meal sitting outside!"
"I love good food... And had been to visit this place for long...
But the wait wasnt that worth...
I ordered for my fav - Nachos... The Nachos chips tasted like the indian rice papads, the cheese layer was very less ..
In the name of salsa-- tomatoe cubes will sprinkled on top... Taste very bland... and average...
But i appreciate the variety you offer...
Quantity and Quality of food can be improved"
Great place to hangout with friends. The food is also good.
Food is amazing.... service can be improved.. overall good experience but can be improved
The best place which gives value for money.... awesome food and drinks... worth a visit
"I was just browsing the net along with my colleagues to explore some good food options and found that the menu of Amigos is really simple and different. The kind of thoughtful ingredients which they have on the menu,gave a brief of how the final dish would be.
I would say the menu was very simple in terms of graphics and stuff, but the description of dishes grabbed my attention within a minute. I just went through the menu and I decided I am ordering something.

I had ordered Cheese Ravioli , Crispy Chilly Garlic Potatoes and Veg lasagna .

Being from hospitality back ground, I can say that If you go to a coffee shop of any good hotel, you will find a similar menu but the prices would...read more"
Garlic bread was best among what ever we had
"A quaint little place, Amigos doesn't disappoint. We went for a lunch on my b'day, 4 people and ordered 4 dishes, 3 of which were Jain :P The non-Jain dish was the Spring Cheese Enchiladas and it was lovely :D The Jain dishes were Nachos Mania, Burritos and Primavera Pasta. Nachos and the pasta were good. The pasta sauce was neither too bland nor too spicy or sweet. I didn't like the burritos though..they were just okay. The best thing is the ambience. Awesome place to hangout with friends and have fun :D"
"Ordered burnt garlic fried rice, pav bhaji, paneer chilly and pizza. the vegetables in rice were all raw and cut in large sizes. paneer was rubbery and the pav bhaji was completely bland. Can't believe this was the same place I was raving about three months back."
"Amazing amAzing amazing... Ppl jus try it... Love the tacos , pastas and garlic bread... Dont miss it.. Value for money... Home delivery service too fast..."
"Recently, I had AMIGOS special pizza. Supposed to have 3 cheeses and exotic vegetables.
It was the first time I ordered a thin crust pizza.
This one was really thin, had cheese but 'Exotic Vegetable' was almost missing.

The other item we ordered was Alfredo pasta which was OK."
"I am an alumni of D.S.R.V (the school just behind this restaurant). Its a delight to see such a place opened here with such good looking decor which is open, it really does add onto the appeal of the area! I was here with my friend Sahil and we both wish that it was around during our school days.
It only serves Veg food.

Ambiance :

I love places like these which provide laid back sitting arrangement. Decor & food rates which appeal to college students. I am sure you will like it too. Though its open. There is some problems related to heat inside the restaurant, the management should look into it.

Lets move onto Food :

1)The quality of food is very good.
2)The rates of the bakery...read more"
A Must Go Place !! Amazing Food ....Try the Veg lasagna and pav bhaji ...just yummieee !!
"""Value for money"" this is the best thing about Amigos. Italian and Mexican food is reasonably priced. Waiters at this place are very naive and most of them does not have any idea what are they serving. Pasta and flavored Mojito is a must try...!!! We did not like the pizza though! Seating is not so comfortable...
Overall a must go if you looking for ""Value for money"" + ""Italian / Mexican Food"""
"its a good small place. food was good. we had apple and blue mojitos. they were very good. quantity is good too. loved Mexican food.
now coming to negatives- lots of flies around which were entering our glass of mojitos and enjoying our food., no washroom. atleast have a washroom pls..."
"I HAPPEN TO BE PASSING BY.THIS PLACE CAUGHT MY EYE.SO DECIDED TO TRY THEIR PASTA(TAKE AWAY).WOW.THAT WHAT I CAN SAY .WELL THEY WERE ALSO VERY ACCOMCODATING TO ADD MUSHROOM TO MY PASTA OUT OF THE MENU.WELL THE PASTA WAS SO GREAT THAT I RETURN THE SAME EVENING TO GET SOME MORE PASTA,PIZZA.I WORD GREAT FLAVOR IN THE FOOD.LOVELY PLACE .ONLY NEED TO WORK ON THE EVENING SITTING REGARDING INSECTS.BUT DO TRY OUT THIS PLACE"
"Amigos!
Well its the huge set up of the resto the caught my eye so I happen to try the ""amigos"" at malad. The ambiance is kick ass and very good school charm with very antique lamps and trendy sits outs to lounge with bunch of friends.The food is very very reasonable and NO taxes!
I tried the jelly custard which was pure bliss with tacos with was okayish.The waiters are a little slow in their reflexes but we honestly had loads of time in hand !
A thumbs up from my end! :D"
"I went to this place for a friend's birthday. Personally, I usually avoid going to vegetarian restaurants. But here, I did not miss non-veg. I relished the food which was amazing. The ambiance is also very good. The garlic bread and cheese and mushroom pasta were my favorite. My only request is to please open a branch close to Bandra......."
"The food is nice pastas,noodles, soups all gr8 at a very good price definitely worth a visit AMIGOS"
"Food is worth a penny! Less price more quantity. Must have the chessy corn balls with the dip is auesome. Meant for pastas, pizzas and Italian food lovers. One cannot end their meal without the chocolate fantasy pastry. Yummmy!"
"This place is a very close to my den... So I visit there quite frequently, though the reason for frequent visits is not the proximity... But the quality and range of food. It serves pizzas pastas Mexican Indian Chinese... Along with cool drinks n backed products... Some of my favorite items include amigos special pizza, pav bhaji, strawberry margarita and tiramisu..
The inside does feel a little suffocating but only in summer... And the service could be much better... But what keeps pulling me back is the food quality and the price... We haven't exceeded 600 bucks per couple yet... So .5 less only for the service... Else it would have been a full 5!"

"I once went in the week this place opened. it has improved over time, but still some improvements are desired. it has now evolved into a bambaiya joint with pizza pasta mex pav bhaji pulao chindian and the likes.
pav bhaji-full marks.
mushroom cheese penne- saltless. otherwise good
nachos with refried beans-something was amiss here. the beans in particular tasted different and cheese sauce was less too.
bbq paneer pizza-good texture good base however had a hint of sweet. guess it was the bbq sauce.
