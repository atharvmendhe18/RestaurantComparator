Tasty food
As usual. Amazing food. This restaurant is a hidden gem. It reminds you of the food you used to get in restaurants of 90's and early 2000's. Nowadays most restaurants don't serve such food at such rates. Keep it up guys üëç

"The Broccoli Soup needs more flavour and bad to be little thick, the Manchow soup has to be a little spicy. Noodles also missing flavour. you guys needs a better chef. Quality has no issues just need some more taste correction"

"Had to wait nearly an hour to get a simple Chinese rice and to add to that it didn't had the right amount of salt. infact, we had to wait for a long time for everything. food was okay but the service was pathetic to say the least"
Not followed the instructions as mentioned in the cooking preparation
Great quality food

"Absolutely pathetic taste , by far the worst order that I‚Äôve ever placed, the butter rotis had no butter and seemed stale , the paneer musallam is just paneer chunks in paneer Bhurjee and absolutely tasteless , the Chinese was the icing on the cake, the triple rice is sweet , ugh , ordered for my mother on Mother‚Äôs Day and absolutely regretting it. DO NOT ORDER"
The food is amazing here. I ordered Nargis kofta which was delicious and also biryani was amazing. the rotis and raita were great too!

I like this food I am gonna eat again and again
This restaurant is situated in Matunga circle..I have tried their punjabi sabzi each one of them is lip smaking..it is really worth the money especially thier paneer do pyaaza ..worth try..they also have a very unique concept of 1 bowl Chinese where in Rice and a paneer gravy /manchurian gravy of your choice is given ..it serves 1 person only .. hence its a good combo if there is only single person visiting this restaurant ..the Chinese served here is really tasty too..I would totally recommend this restaurant for everyone
"Multi cruzine Family restaurant - Punjabi ,Chinese South Indian food best in vicinity,

I ordered chicken tikka biryani and the waiter asked me if I wanted raita with it and I said yes they charged me 150 rupees just for the raita. I've been to so many place and nobody has ever charged for the raita and at least not 150 just for the raita

"Ahar restaurant & bar .
Located in the matunga east.
Recently I visited this place with my friends.
We fully enjoyed.
Taste of all food is best.
Price is reasonable.
Service is good"
"Hotel. Ahar food restaurants located matunga east, Mumbai.
Food is best.
Staff service is best.
Food quality is awesome.
Taste of food is best.
Ambiance is good.
Food presentation is best."
"Ahar, is right on the cross road intersection at Kings Circle. It's a cosy place to enjoy some lip-smacking delicious Maharashtrian coastal delicacies. The Raavas Tama Fry and the beer Dosas with fish curry are highly recommended. So are the ravaa fried prawns and pomfret curry.
The place has two sections including a family room and a separate air-conditioned bar. A nice place to catch up with friends over drinks or dig into some awesome coastal cuisine with family."
"We reached here at around 3pm in afternoon, the manager started off by saying 'place your order fast, this is the last order'. When we asking him about the gravy, he seemed to be extremely irritated, being closing time its still understood. After that our food came by 3.45, we had ordered a chicken thali and chicken ghee roast. Every dish in menu was ice cold, right from chapati to gravy to daal and rice. Chicken ghee roast was tasteless, it just tasted of tomato and extensive ghee, imagine plain tomato gravy served with loadsss of ghee. Its better to tell the customer, that they do not accept order post 3pm, rather then giving such service after paying 800."
"Visited this place last Sunday on my friend‚Äôs suggestion...they have a separate family section...food service is quick..food was tasty..and quantity was good too..
Tried chicken hot and sour soup, chicken tikka, saraswat style chicken, kombadi vade, stuffed bombil ...1500 for 3 people‚Äôs dinner"

"Love the solkadi. It is thick & flavourful, unlike many places which serve it watery. I make sure to order it everytime I visit. Fish is ok, could be better. They have a nice A/C family section next to the bar."
"My frnd Imran Mukadam mobile number 9820287129

Pls refund his amount."
"I visited family restaurant. We ordered starters and main course. Food was yummy. The service is nice, staff is friendly. Only constraint was the space is a bit congested. The experience was worth it.

A neighborhood drinking joint. Tried the Mandeli Fry which was pretty good. The Chicken Ghee Roast was a disappointment as it was like a chicken masala with ghee. Not anywhere close to the original or for that matter like New Madras does it in Sion. So far thats the best I've had yet in Mumbai. They have ukda chawal but its surprisingly the polished one and not the unpolished one. The gassi also was average. Would suggest go here to drink and have the kebabs/ frys along with your drink. Avoid the main course items as they are average to sub par. They have a separate family section but I'm not a family type person so no clue. Decor is average like a neighborhood drinking joint
Food is very awesome staff also nice bt this is family restaurant bt rajesh karke ek weater hai unko pta nhi family section mai jeants allow nhi hai other rooms khali hoke bhi wo ladka jeants ko family mai seating ke bol rha hai ye acha nhi hai an ye hamara first tym nhi second tym huva hai so please hamari ek request hai hotel owner ko apke staff ko batake rakho please
A Good Quality Restaurant...must eat paneer chilli...prefer veg to eat in main course....in starter u can eat tandoori chicken...For a change u must try expending
"A rat chewing away leftovers in the service corridor (between the kitchen and sitting areas), was brought to attention of the Restaurant Manager. His instant reply was ""Yeh roj ka problem hai"" (this is an everyday issue) and walked away. When confronted again if he can solve this problem, he said he cannot solve the problem and said "" Joh bhi complaint marna hai kar lo"" (make whatever complaint you want)."
"Awesome food, good service, every dish which v ordered was fantastic, value for money. Staff is very polite, quality of food is too too good, liked d place very much"
"Staff is not at all bothered about customer service
Food served here is not of Good quality
Place is not comfortable
Should not visit with family they have different place for it but not worth"
"Horrible staff & cockroaches everywhere
Please please please please please please please please please please please please dont enter the place
Eat at your own risk"
"The family section has a good ambience though the place is quite small. Panner dishes are the only options for veg. Non-veg is quite good, especially their chicken biriyani is one of the best. Their service is a disappointment."
