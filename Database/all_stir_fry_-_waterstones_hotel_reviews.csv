"HORRIBLE FOOD, THERE WAS NO CHICKEN AND ONLY CRUNCHY BATTER."

"I had come here for a breakfast buffet and it was honestly one of the best dining experiences I had. The ambience is so vibrant yet cozy, its the perfect for mornings. The food too is of great quality and taste. The staff is very courteous and catering.
All in all, it was an amazing experience."
"The packaging is TERRIBLE! The soup and the chili chicken as you can see in the pictures were all spilled. The taste isn't anything to even write about. we spent 1700 on this unappetising food, so please, please think twice before ordering. your Gravy will come in the plastic packet. I would rather opt for a 5 Spice/ Mainland China than these guys. pathetic service, at least you will get your Penny's worth. Awful experience."

The quality of the food and the preperation of the wok was better than the Colaba branch! Mr. Salman was extremely sweet and an absolute gentleman. really sad to hear that this brach is shutting down in 2 months. Service and food was amazing! Truly made my night eating here.ü•∞
"The food is beautiful. But it's great when you have portion control. This is exactly what the Sunday brunch buffet let's you do. You can enjoy the starters and soup but keep that space for the main cours, cause it's a bomb! You can choose your veggies,meats, & other proteins to go with your rice and noodles and watch them prepare it at the live counter which is fun to watch. Overall a lovely Sunday brunch."

"Visited the Andheri outlet no drinks options as per menu were there. No cocktails were available. Mock tails were also limited.
Dim-sums were also out of stock. Order time for 3 starters was way too long. This outlet needs some serious rethinking in terms of availability of food options and drinks"

"All Stir Fry,colaba
Located few meters away from Gateway of India, this Chinese restaurant offer good quality south east Asian offerings.

Prices are bit on the higher side which initially I thought was the case for the south Mumbai outlet but later on found that it‚Äôs a chain of restaurant."

Kushal did an excellent job
Pathetically slow service‚Ä¶..after 1.5 hrs of waiting had to leave after eating just the starters!
Visited All stir fry on a weekday afternoon and opted for the wok buffet which was worth it. The prawns in black pepper sauce was very nice Thanks to Chef Bala. Virgil our server too very helpful. Overall it was a nice dining experience.

I had gone there for my birthday and had quite an embarrassing experience. The wok is inedible now. A sorry experience to have. There are much better Asian restaurants in the city. Do not waste your time and money on this one.

"Terrible food and service. Vegetables were either frozen or stale. Chefs could not do basic stir fry even after several instructions. Extremely over priced. No value for money. The vibe of the restraunt was gloomy and no manager around to even have a conversation about thr service/food.

Had heard good stuff about the idea and place but had a terrible experience."

Terrible place to be. Most of the items from menu were missing. Imported wines missing. Limited veg starters. Valet wasn‚Äôt available at the time of leaving. Poor Approach road‚Ä¶ NEVER VISIT
"This used to be one of our favourite restaurants and we went here to celebrate a special occasion but this time it was very disappointing.
We ordered 2 starters - Crackling chicken and spinach and a prawn one. The chicken was so over fried and chewy that it was impossible to eat! Unfortunately the staff was so busy that we couldn't even get their attention. Finally someone came to ask for feedback and when shared replaced it. Our drinks took very long to come as well. For the main course we ordered mee goreng and it was disastrous. Nothing like the what it's supposed to taste. Also as per the menu, it was supposed to have bean sprouts and the dish actually had raw barely sprouted moong....read more"

"If you are looking for vegetarian food, this is not the place I would recommend. Service was good, polite and courteous and they really tried hard to make up so full marks for that.. However the food preparation was not upto the mark."
