The lung Fung soup had no salt and it tasted horrible. The butter chicken was literally tomato ketchup and sugar. There was no other taste to it. I am never ordering from here again

"This is one of my favourite restaurant. Have been visiting this place for a while now, always come back to have their white tandoori- my absolute favourite. This place is perfect for a low-key fam dinner and the staff is very friendly!

Feel free to check it out for yourself."

Had ordered chicken tikka masala and one Naan and one roti..had sat for drink and food here before..so well aware of the taste..the food quality and quantity is amazing..really love the taste.. normally the naan gets cold n soggy but not the case with them..it was just as I ordered..will definitely recommend for good taste and good quantity..and would definitely order again.
I ordered for the first and food was really tasty and fresh... we enjoyed it

the quantity of the food is not at all worth the price

"Mr. shekhar poojari gives a good service and all good and menu is affordable.
Very good place to go out .
Recommendable"
This is extremely good place. Its located close to the highway. Their mangalorean delicacies and sea food really good. We ordered their butter chicken and some starters which were a speciality of their own restaurant. They have a separate family and a separate bachelor s section plus they have a non ac section too. Staff is polite including the owner who would make you comfortable.

"Family restro bar, great food and is reasonably priced . Service is very good.try white tandoori and chicken ghee roast with neer dosa very tasty."

Pawan kitchen & Bar has a ample of siting space. I personally like this place very much. Drink are at reasonable price. I tried Soyabeen Chilly which was great and tried Chicken Gravy lollipop which was ok.
"Recently visited this place with my friends we ordered Chicken fired rice, as our order came we were very much disappointed by the quantity they were serving at this high price, but we thought the taste would be better and that to was disappointed, we literally had to dig to find chicken pieces, very less quantity of chicken too. We didn't order further because of this disappointment. Will never recommend to any. Also they have not updated their menu on Zomato as Rates are higher."
"Faltu place
Ordered chicken tikka masala full
In uploaded menu its shown 260 but they charged 350.
Quantity is not even sufficient for 2 person
6 small pieces of chicken and thin gravy
Bullshit taste"
Been multiple times here.... Good place to have delicious food... The staff is friendly... The biryani you get is one of the best in Navi Mumbai... Hats off to the chef. Overall a fun place to have a drink and tasty food with friends
Nice place to hang for quick drinks session...Typical bar ambience...Reasonable pricing...Plus point is solace in vicinity...Must have dishes here are kaleji fry and white tandoori chicken with beer...
Unhygienic food. In the morning vegetables are kept on the back side of hotel. Nobody is there to take care of vegetable. Crows eat these vegetables like tomatos. Main course dishes and salad is prepared using these tomatos. See the attached photo for proof.
The has both a/c and Non a/c options for drinks there is not much difference in the price of drinks. Even the price is quite reasonable you can get a beer in 250rs.
The first thing to notice is the good interior that has transformed it from a 70's look to much modern look. Food served here has always been good. I have been ordering for more than decade. No complaints whatsoever !!!
Pathetic.. This MENU CARD is OLD one.. I ordered this food now... & bill is 50rs higher than what i expected ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  Zomato should check whether The Hotels menu card up to date or Not... Very disappointing
"The restaurant has taken a 360 degree turn from the last 7 years. It used to like a country bar few years back. Now it has developed into a very good eatery.We had Egg Bhurji, Paneer Manchurian,Garlic Channa, Bangda Fry and Mandeli Fry. Special mention to Garlic channa, the lasoon is really tasty and itâ€™s fried appropriately. Even both the fish fries were good. You get all types of alcoholic beverages here, so we can have a good time with your buddies. Prices are reasonable and service is very good."
