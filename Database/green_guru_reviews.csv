"The quality of food was excellent. I loved how value for money as well as tasteful the food was. Also, the best part was that they sent Tawa Chapati with thali, which made it much better. Will definitely order more food items from this place. Just loved it!"

"There were small white hard plastic pieces inside the Palak paneer paratha , it looks similar to paneer only hence Zomato is also not able to verify that from images"

paratha is so so thick at middle so it's uncooked it's taste like dough to eat

"Chhas was not given in glass👿.

As per the rate packing is very bad. Food taste is also OK."

"Excellent food quality along with unique menu options to choose from. Has something unique for people from all age groups.

Do try out the Mexican rice bowl and the black burger!"
"I went here with my family. The place is really nice, and the staff is very friendly. We ate the Pav Bhaji, Stuffed Parathas and Pasta, and it was incredibly delicious. Would definitely recommend"
had the best pink sauce pasta every. loved every bit of it. the portion size was so much. completely value for money!! will highly recommend ahead.
""
paratha was not served with Chana Masala instead they gave matki usal which was odd combination. also for two paratha they gave only one usal
"cheese chilli toast was not as expected, as it had no taste and was very soggy."
""
extremely bad quality and bad taste of food
worst ever pasta I have tasted
bad quality
really nice place in thane for vegetarian options! the stuffed double crunch paratha is just magic must try
Perfect place for small family outing.!!
"This place is just near our house and it is a one stop solution to fill your stomach. Right from burgers to indianised chapati. This place has everything!
Loved the food and taste!"
Biriyani we ordered was very good also their tawa tandoori roti they call was soft n fresh
Paneer tikka pizza was just yum!
worth every penny. must try
"One word Answer: Pathetic.

Explanation: Ordered mushrooms vegetable and it happened to be very bad in quality. Mushrooms were smelling like garbage. And they smartly made it very very spicy and also added to much of salt.
Please do not prefer this Restaurant Green Guru."
