Review
"Ordered food from here in good faith. I kid u not i lost my appetite after eating food from this restaurant . first order was pasta what i got was over boiled , super soft , weird tasting shit . well me being a patient goodboy i thought maybe my second order be good so i left my pasta alone and open my cheese garlic paratha and unbelievably i was not disappointed just about to take a first bite a worm crept outside from the the paratha , i mean seriously , thank you . i was thinking of going on a diet since new years . The restaurant name is definitely an irony . enough said."
The food is good and well within an affordable price range...decent place for small families to go out and eat. Amritsari and Chinese at this place are worth a try...
"Have been ordering from this place for a long time, compact place to eat but the service and quality is good and compensates the same. Delivered within moderate time as per the vicinity. Love the The Chicken Triple Schezwan fried rice which is good in Quality and high quantity enough for 2 people. That is Moneys worth...."
"Worst Resturant I have ever seen till date, waiters are highly trained to show attitude and place stink like hell, food is average and cost is fair, hope I get 0.0 rating in Zomato. Don't ever go and try."
"Have ordered food at around 11:00 in the evening for a Chicken Hongkong Rice and Chicken Chinese Noodles Chowmein. The order that was delivered was an Incorrect one. So had returned the food back and was about to cancel the order however felt pity on the delivery guy and gave them another chance, after that again had called and confirmed the order over the phone which I shouldn't have, still the order which was delivered for the second time was incorrect order. Had to send it back again. Didn't get a chance to taste their food, so cannot comment on that. First impression was really very terrible. Feedback to others would be, If you are crazily hungry then don't order food from here as...read more"
"The place is very small, but clean and tidy.
Its a good choice if you want to have a quick but heavy lunch or dinner. Service is adequately fast, but staff's behavior needs little improvement.
Me and my friend had very usual stuff
1) Veg. Kolhapuri (3.5/5)
2) Roti (1.5/5) it was too hard.
3) Garlic naan (3.5/5)
4) Sweet Lassi (4/5)"
"Cozily located around a very high traffic zone. Just happened to see this place and didn't want to travel anywhere as it were peak traffic hours.
We ordered a chicken chulha in starters. Honestly it didn't live up to expectations and we just hoped that the main course compensates, and it did. Didn't take any risk and straight away ordered butter chicken with paratha and naan. These things were killer and made it up for the average starter. Try this place for their Indian breads."
"Visited this for lunch, recommended by my colleague. It is a small place with 4-5 tables. Punjabi Food is ""The Best"".
Should try Parathas and Dal Makhni."
This place being near by to my place!! And now like my 2nd home.. You shud try the kebabs here.. Yes the staff needs to be educated on hospitality but then when it comes to food i cannot resist chinese!! I wud rate it a 3/5 i still expect the service to be better..
"I have visited this place long time back and had also ordered ones. This place was suggested by one of my colleague saying they serve good North Indian food.
The place is comparatively small with 5-6 tables.

I tried their Aloo onion paratha which is served with curd and dal makhni. I was very disappointed with the taste of dal makhni as I expected it to be one of their best serving.

Then ones I had ordered pesto pasta, let me tell you what a disappointment it was the sauce was no where close to pesto :(
And it sucked big time.

I m pretty sure I m never visiting this place again.

Food: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5
Service: 2.5/5"
"Used to visit this place when it was small, without an sitting area, it was more like a stall put up on the pavement.

They used to serve parathas and poori bhaji. Latter was so good, we used to order a parcel for our dinner.

Have not visited the place for years now, looking at the pictures in zomato, they sure have expanded and doing well.

Will pay the visit soon."
"We had few of our colleagues who tried the paratha and it was kind of amazing. So thought about ordering for biryani and corporate meal.

When it come to paratha specially the onion one 100marks but the other items we will never recommend.
Rice was not cooked properly
Dal was tasteless

It took lot of time to deliver

So we will stick to parathas going ahead"
"# For Whom?

Located in the middle of Corporate Buildings at a 3 minute walk from Chakala J. B. Nagar Metro Station, this place is surely difficult to find. 

This small place has tried to accommodate as much as they can with a layout that would make you skeptical as to where does it excel. Owner by a Sikh Man, we should have stuck to ordering Punjabi food but then, my friend had different ideas.

Anyways, this place is for Paratha lovers. A good variety of Parathas available with reasonably priced combo offers would definitely let you have a filling meal.

# Let's talk about food.

We started with 5 Parathas Combo where we went for:

1. Aloo Onion - It felt like I was having an Onion...read more"
"Decent place to slip out to for lunch. A little difficult to spot, with only a solitary board mentioning the name of the establishment, that too seems to be in ninja mode hidden from sight.
If you go there in a group, they have a nice paranthas combo which gets you some 5 paranthas in less than 300 bucks...pretty good bang for the buck. The paranthas were decent enough, though the Maa ki dal with it wasn't particularly brilliant. I suggest you get some extra butter and use it on both the dal and the paranthas.....the meal becomes instantly awesome"
"Used to be a good place, but after having today's meal, I would recommend plz switch to some other option, Not worth at all. At last choice is yours."
"This joint is located near the metro station of Chakala/JB Nagar Andheri E.
I had visited this place in the evening a few days back.
The sad part was the owner/Manager was missing and the staff were zombies.
No good restaurant can run in the absence of a Manager or the owner.
The food was at par with any Dhaba at the Highway.
The Manchurian rice portion was good for two people but the taste was the same as the street stalls.
Should have ordered the North Indian Instead,
Found a broom stick piece in the rice to which the staff apologized and gave a discount in the bill.
I would genuinely request the Management to look into it.
Service was prompt."
"Been there last month on my Trip to India
It has been a royal ""Nightmare"".
The Chicken Kadai was served at the room tempreture and found a hair to which the staff never cared.
The Naans was just like having a slipper fried in butter.
How can you serve crap like this?
The staff is ruthless and rude and stare as if they have never seen a Woman.
Never the less 
will never c this place again."
The ambiance was good. Food is slightly above average and service is average. Their choice is kind of limited but I feel it is better to do well in a limited choice. They can offer something more in dessert.
"I made the mistake of ordering chinese and was punished with an upset stomach. This place is only good for thalis and Paratha Combos. When you are bored of eating out everyday and want to try something more simple and cheap try this restaurant. The paratha Combos were brilliant and filled me up for just Rs.150 bucks. So quite aptly named, Appetite restaurant is for those who have quite an appetite!"
"I have only ordered from here for home delivery.I would rate their food to be good. 
Have only ordered Indian vegetarian .I must say have been happy with their food quality. 

They have a range of parathas and the Tawa variety at that - which you dont find in a lot of restaurants.And I liked their Rajma Chawal.
 
This is one of the good restaurants in Andheri for homestyle Rajma chawal. 
Would definitely recommend it for that!"
"Awesome food...If you wanna have a break from typical restaurants...yet wana have a full satisfying meal......then this place is bang on.....Amazing heavenly food.... Aloo gobi parathas, Methi parathas, Rajma Chawl,  Dal Makhani,  Afgani Chicken and the list goes on....People who live to eat...should definitely visit once......
The outlet is situated at a prime location....just besides the Guru Dwara JB nagar...
Ambience is not that great.....Service is decent...
However its  VFM ( Value For Money) for sure!!!!"
Had veg biryani and liked it.. Proper spicy masala biryani... My friends liked their non veg biryani too. Salad that came along with rice was pathetic ?. They gave spoon fork tissue in nice sealed packet which made it handy to eat even in parcel...
"Superb joint....best for Kebab (afgani), pasta n chinese too. Nice quiet n small place to have good tasty food. Been thr several times...food was as expected delicious. Reasonable to pocket.
VFM"
"After reading so many good reviews here, me and my friend thought of giving this place a try.
This place is very close to JB NAGAR metro station. It is a quiet and small place , on the outside it looks like a coffee shop.
We had ordered chicken tikka biryani and hakka noodles. Man, it was disastrously bad.Too bad. Hakka noodle was very dry.Chicken Tikka biryani was too tangy, too much tangy. We let the manager know about it and he told usthey had added some chutney to it. Whatever it is our evening was spoilt and damage was already done.

No, I wouldn't be going again."
"Perfect place for corporate lunch. Quite and good decent ambiance. Taste is simple and the portion of food is very good. I suggest not to go alone as you might land up having some leftover.
Beware of the taxes which are not included in the menu rates."
Delhi wala awesome taste. Pocket friendly. Convenient. .
"Simply blissful, food was so simple and so amazing that makes all the 5 star feel like dhaba. The style of cooking and taste of food make you feel you are having your meal in punjab itself.

First time ever ordered vegetarian from any non veg restaurant but was really satisfied like this, the naans inspite of being delivered at home were so soft I was shocked from the get go. Paneer tikka masala and amritsari dal makhani were really good. Neither to spicy nor to masala made to its perfect.

Ordered paratha as well it was Ok but I feel the pleasure was lost only because it was delivered at home and it had become cold, if it would have been eaten at the restaurant it would have tasted...read more"
Opposite 7 flags but better in every way. It has been almost a year ordering from this joint but it never gets boring. The best place in andheri to have kebabs and north indian stuff. Though small in size it has a good variety to offer. The owner is a certified chef which explains the authentic food. The best thing to try is the mangolian rice which you can't resist even if you have three times a week.
I use to visit this place for after office dinner or after late movies near theatre... It brings the effect of being in Delhi... Really Such a wonderful parathas and any item in panner would be great... For Non Veg Lovers they got lot in Chicken... Must Try for Punjabi Dish Lovers
A decent place for having a good Punjabi food...You will enjoy paratha's with Lassi!!! A must visit place with your partner. Cz it's so calm and quite you can speak your heart out... :)
"One time visit mostly

There is nothing surprising about this place.. Pretty average ambience, food menu regular, easy location, taste of food is ok.. We ordered paranthas which werent wow but only ok.."
", The place is surprisingly empty ironic to the good food it serves . ordered a chicken tikka biriyani . It was served in time . The chicken was cooked properly and the gravy was really sumptuos"
"Hvnt been there but ordered quiet a lota food.. the paranthas are absolutely devine..with d yummy home made yoghurt (n when i say home made its jus lik d one ur mom wud make).. d biryani is unlike ne other iv ever had.. (I'd say not even biryani-ish)..bt d chinese food is gr8.. wen de say spicy.. b rest assured ur gettin spicy!
All in all.. typical punjabi tastes at its best.."
"Cafe appetite serves happy food. Its a place which makes me happy. The must try is the afghani chkn tandoori and chkn mongolian rice, both being my favourites. The mongolian rice is divine...with fried rice being topped with semi dry chkn and egg(salivating at the thought of it).
The kebabs are tasty succulent n juicy.
The chkn crispy is also worth a mention as the chkn is not batter fried but tossed in the sauce.
The owner personally looks after the arrangements and gives suggestions as well
Waiting to try their paratha combos still. Go out there and get happy :)"
Rocks. Their soups are amazing and they have multiethnic varieties of Parathas served with rajma and raita. I love this place. It is cozy and warm and quite silent
"Amazing food, not the place for ambience driven folks......but food at its best :)
Must try - (1) Afgani Chicken (2) Chicken Kalami Kebab (3) Veg dry in garlic sauce (4) Chicken chilli cheese paratha....dinner for 4 adults and 1 kid cost me 1.3k :)

Highly recommended"
"Genuinely good food. Dal Makhani Rice and Rajma Chawal are awesome. Kebabs are great. Not a big fan of their Chinese though. But they deserve a 5.0 rating, just purely cause of their nice homely food and really well marinated kebabs."
"Good Food. Had gone there for having authentic punjabi rajma chawal. And must say, was not disappointed at all.
The Tandoori chicken starter was also decent enough.Ambience is simple. All in all, good place to have good food."
I  was never introduced to this restro even when I was around the area of this space but  with  the   help of  friends  got in  for the first  time  to have  Chinese food which was treat to  our  tongue we enjoyed the  hot served Mongolian  rice which was new in the list for  us as well as  our  hungry  stomach  dint have any  further thoughts of having the same old schezwan  rice   the  ambiance is  fine  during the day  but   slight  change in the interior  will...read more
"Nice street smart joint to have some delicious paranthas. Reasonably priced and nice combination of choices to pick your parantha from. Though the ambience is very simple and basic, the quality of the paranthas and kebabs makes up for it. 

A few of my favorites are:
AFGHANI CHICKEN - Cravings cannot be controlled, some people eat to live and some live to eat, if you too belong to the latter group then you must try this amazingly delicious dish. I bet you will love it. 
CHILLY CHEESE CHICKEN PARATHAS - This one is simply divine. It is generously stuffed with cheese and chicken until it bursts at the seams.
KATHI ROLLS - The rolls are quite nice too. Have tried a few and have liked them...read more"
"Randomly found this place on Zomato while looking up places to order food. You'd notice all the reviews on this page about Cafe Appetite are positive and after trying the food here, I stand by every one of them. The Indian food is absolutely delicious. The combos are particularly awesome if you are trying to eat on a budget and don't have someone to share food with. The combo consists of 1 rice, 1 dal, 1 gravy, steamed rice, raita and papad. All that came up to about 140 bucks. The katti rolls, however, aren't a great idea for delivery as they get very soggy by the time they reach. A friend ordered soup and literally three people could share it, so I'd say the quantity is great too. All...read more"
"Taking a break for lunch, we were quite in a situation to decide where to go n get back to work quickly. The nearby options were open inclusive of Appetite.
We rushed in, hoping that it wouldn't be to time consuming & that's where it stepped up. We ordered a Kalmi kebab, a known dish from this resto along with Amritsari chicken tikka masala. Adding to our good meal, they had Chapati's to offer.

Came our Kalmi kebabs. Trust me, you'd love even the look of it. The chicken was juicy, tender. Slightly under-marinated though. But the amazing chutney just filled in the gaps.
Verdict : Delicious!
The tikka masala really had a strong Amritsari touch to it. Pretty generous with the amount of...read more"
"I love this joint as I have spent a couple of years in Delhi.. The food is authentic punjabi ghar ka khana.. My fav at this place is afghani chicken, kaali daal and naan.. Heaven!! This is a very small tidy joint and VFM!! The owner is Raji and he is very jovial and helpful.. We also had a different type of chicken biryani here which was more like pulao but very tasty"
Bad food. Definitely not a 3.6! Had paneer tikka masala w/o paneer tikka. Rajma chawal below average
"Amazing Chinese food. Kebabs. Mushroom. Pasta.
Quiet ambience. Quick service. Decent decor
Very friendly polite owner."
"Me and a friend stumbled upon this place after we needed a place to hang out for a bit and grab a bite in the evening. A quick visit to Zomato pointed us to Cafe Appetite (Yeah the name is kind of cheesy)

The first thing that comes to mind is that although this is dressed up as a cafe, it is more like a Punjabi Dhaba in terms of the kind of food you get here. The owner/manager, a friendly Sardar is nice to chat with and takes an interest in how the food is.

We ordered the Kalmi Kebab and a half Chulha chicken, both of which were delicious. Hard to get authentic North Indian in Mumbai but this was as close to Delhi style kebabs as I've seen in the city. They have decent parathas as...read more"
"one thing i judge in every restaurant that serves Indian-Chinese food is their schezwan chutney...
I must say i m little disappointed here.. the chutney is very dry and has very strong ginger flavor.. Rest of the food is also average.. We ordered chicken lolly-pop.. Good size but taste could be better...
And finally you can't cheat people by sending normal fried rice as chili rice.. their was no chili (or spice in it)
Quantity is good (depending on your appetite :D)
So is the delivery time!!"
"This is one place in Andheri which has never disappointed me! They have almost everything one could think of having in the menu ranging from Mughlai, Chinese and Italian. The mughlai dishes have the typical north flavour which I always devour on! the dal makhani and the chicken are spectacular!! Another dish worth a mention is the 'Chilly cheese paratha' just melts in the mouth. I also liked the Schezwan noodles which came with a side gravy. And if this was not enough the 'Mamarosso Pasta' too just tickles your taste buds the right way! All in all Amazing place with 'North Indian Street food' flavours!
Overall,
Food : 4.5/5
Ambiance : Its a small cafe with minimal decor
Taste : 4.8/5

"It just got short of 1 point because me and my family still feel there is a lot they can improve on. It's my family's favourite joint for having good food home delivered. They have all their dishes of good quality and taste and the pricing is what sets them apart from the others. Very reasonable and taste of food is justified in terms of its price.
They do understand their customers really well. They have even helped replace few dishes which was home delivered and were just not good enough with its taste. Their kebabs which they claim to have been awarded as the BEST still should be more succulent than it is."
"Had quite a nice lunch from here. I ordered home. The paratha combo, which was two parathas with dal makhani, curd and a pepsi. Very good for just Rs.100.
I asked for 1 methi and 1 aloo & onion paratha. Good flavour though ordering parathas home was not really a good idea. They were a bit soggy as they came wrapped in foil, guess the steam couldn't escape. Though i can't fault the restaurant for this as everyone want's their food delivered hot. Would recommend having the parathas there as i will next time.
The dal makhani was ok, a little watery. It should actually be thick. Your supposed to get the chole with the parathas but they stopped it for some reason, hence the dal. I prefer...read more"
"Its a nice punjabi joint managed by a big jolly sardarji . I always find it good if a sardar is heading a food joint, more often than not its an indication that the food is good.

I ordered gobhi,aloo paranthas and paneer bhurjee with chapatis. Everything was fresh and nice esp the bhurjee. However couple of things didnt seem right. One the ambience is completely plain with around 3 tables and no music to go with it. And second the portion sizes are small. The tawa paranthas are medium at best and the paneer bhurjee although heavenly was just about enough for one and half people.

The menu is also very confusing with mughlai and pasta in it and some 10 dishes in the end hand written which...read more"
"This place is super awesome. One of the best hotels in Andheri East. For people who like simple food and who like to have it peacefully this is the rite place. I love this place and i visit this place regularly. Try Afghani Kabab, Chicken chilly cheese paratha and butter chicken :) . I have it every time i go there :P"
"Been goin here past 2 years and really love the food. Ambience is simple, and is comfortable. Food taste amazing.."
"Good food, but small place. Also, ambience is very average.

3 stars only for the food."
"Went to this restaurant a few days back. Forget about the ambiance..they have just one waiter running around the tables..average food...highly over-priced..poor service...For this budget I am sure one would opt for Pop Tates, Curry Twist, Kailash Parbhat or 5 Spice covering all cuisines...Totally not worth it..."
"Great Place some awesome food, its a foodise Paradise, been there more than 20 times in the last 2 years, the Parathas and Pastas and kababs are a family favourite"
"After a lot of canceled plans this weekend, I got a few friends together to agree to head out for dinner on a lazy Sunday evening.
