"They forgot to pack the dips. In a dish such a momos, they forgot to add in dips. Imagine paying upwards of 350 for this convinience, then having to eat momos straight out without any dips. Oh and kudos on the problem solving aspect of it, when I contacted Zomato support, the flat out informed me appetite momos has not been picking up calls, and are unreachable at the moment. Rating this one star as there is no option for anything less than that."

"The steamed chicken momos were very low quality. It looked stale and the outer coating was too thick and very little chicken stuffing inside. Momos were not fresh!
Even the fried chicken were not consistent."
