"Being a Chinese speciality restaurant, chilli vinegar was not sent at all. no chinese sauces with the food. soya was sent only for soup and not food. Chicken fried rice was very dry and rice was raw. Not expected from MC"

Great place for a Family Dinnerâ€¦ we tried the Chinese New Year Menu and it was fabulousâ€¦ their Dimsums are truly the bestâ€¦ Do try the Longevity Noodlesâ€¦ simple and classyâ€¦ staff was friendly and the place has great vibesâ€¦ Chocolate Dome for dessert is highly recommended
"We happened to try mainland china which is very well known for its exclusive Chinese meals. We tried their Chinese new year menu.
Which is on going this February from 9 to 29.
The vibes are simply aesthetically amazing grande restaurant with comfortable and cozy seating for small as well as for larger groups. The staff is quite quick.
We started off with watermelon cilantro crush followed by thai exotica both the mocktails were great combination of juices along with the mocktails we also called for asparagus tempura sushi and blue pea spicy asparagus dumplings served with variety of sauces even the cottage cheese with sichuan numbing was delish the appetizers were amazingly.

Very very few veggies in the soup

I had requested the restaurant to send me khimchi as I am unwell to travel to dine in. They sent a whole bag of khimchiðŸ™‚ðŸ’• They always take care of their customers. Had received a box of dessert complimentary few months back. Superlike and kudos to the staff :)
ordered online the crabmeat corn soup for dinner. though I didn't like the consistency of the soup and the fact that i would have liked to see and taste the sweet meat of the crabmeat (it was finely shredded) they accepted my requests of adding sauces and also a side of kimchi. that was much appreciated. and packing was well done.

"it was not that great, sparse of chicken cubes"
We tried Hunan Prawns and Assorted Pepper Chicken & Dragon Chicken Fried rice the taste was superbâ€¦The service by Mahadev was cherry on the topâ€¦Recommended to try Hunan Prawns if you visit Mainland Chinaâ€¦
Very late
This has not been expected from Mainland Chains we ordered veg Truffle Eddamme rice and we have got non veg truffle Eddamme rice and we have eaten it n9t realising it was non veg this service is not at all accountable send I suggest none of you to order from this restaurant again
Inspite of charging in full items are missing
poor taste
Food was bad.. the quality of this place has gone down completely there were flies moving around our table and foodâ€¦
good food

"The food isnâ€™t the same anymore. Noodles were smudged, sticky and mashed. The Pomfret, for which we paid 4X extra, was full of oil & tasteless. Regret eating out by not only wasting calories but also money. Avoid."

"Visited for lunch, naresh was warm, friendly and had good knowledge about the menu. Recommend perfect food and served with care. Ali was also pleasant and helpful."

I have visited other branches and the food was nice but here the food was not good. The service was also not apt and the utensils were not correct in which it is served.
""
tasteless cold food... way different than what you get at their restaurants... quality not matching MC standards ... stale food
""
Good comforting food. Authentic chinese and the staff is very friendly
""
I found a strand of hair in the chilli chicken. Thatâ€™s absolutely disgusting
""
General Tsaos chicken was too salty & not edible
""
By far the best soothing soup ever !!
""
Very delicious food and authentic Chinese preparation.
A cosy place to have food with family and friends
Cold and soggy
""
was delivered cold and late
""
Food was awesome
I am a regular visitor to this restaurant. The food is generally quite good but sometimes NOT UPTO THE MARK. Service is generally okay. Rates are a bit on the higher side.
bad packaging and spilled . need refund
Disappointed with the food.
""
Everything lacked seasoning. While the manchow soup had too much soya sauceâ€¦â€¦ always have had better food from Mainland China but today was disappointing
""
"My first smoked chilli main that had generous amount of sweetness. It was a very poor impression of this dish. The fried rice was an epic disappointment. A few years ago, it was a go to dish every time I will visit india. I suspect going further, I will give mainland China a miss..all good things eventually end!!"
We were late but still the restaurant staff managed to serve us. Though they looked like little under staff and servers were just running around to serve customers.
"We arrived at the restaurant and there was a fly in our glass. The waiter just gave a lousy explanation that it's an open area, hence there was a fly there. Later, when we ordered a cold drink there was a cockroach in it. They even had the audacity to defend that it's not a cockroach.

Terrible experience. The food quantity was so little. It wasn't even enough for two people.

Never coming here again and won't recommend it to anyone ever."

The jasmine rice was awesome and so was the general taos chicken.. 1 star deducted for the fact that khimchi was made using indian cabbage.. which was highlighted at the restaurant to the waiter and he accepted
"Thankyou Mohan and Dinesh for serving us,and the chef behind the yummy food,we three friends enjoyed our lunch and Dinesh also checked that we get what we wanted ( according to one of our friend's mushroom allergy)Loved the food,Our all time fav.Very well renovated."
the quality of rice they used to make the fried rice dish was not the same that I have eaten at the restaurant. I guess they use low quality rice for online delivery dishes. Sad
uncooked food
"undercooked food, didn't expect such a level of poor performance"
excellent service and fantastic food... crispy duck with chilli plum sauce was excellent
