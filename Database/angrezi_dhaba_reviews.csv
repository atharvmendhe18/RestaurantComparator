Its was nice place
Panner Tikka was so good and flavour one . and they provide very good service
"One of the awesome place we come across in Todi mills. Angrezi Dhaba they have varities of cuisines.

My food recommendation
Macroni Cheese pasta was mouthwatering too Creamy cheese perfect for cheese pasta love.

Spike spice Cheese fondue it has spicy after taste and cheesy in every bite. We really enjoyed fondue.

Butter garlic mushroom this was super tasty and excellent dish for mushroom lover

Triple Schezwan rice was great it's delectable.

Virgin pinacolda was luscious.

Thank you

"Visited This Place 3rd Time and disappointed.
Poor Food Quality
When we complained About Food Waiter Was Like Abhi Closing Karne Ka Time Hai Adjust Karlo Like What The F**k?
Ordered Veg Fried Rice No Veggies No Salt No Taste When I complained About Taste Waiter Was Like Chinese Aisa Hi Hota Hai.
Ac is also not working properly here
Please Never Visit This 3rd Grade Restaurant
Instead Of This Angrezi Dhaba Ill Prefer Road Side Chinese!
Angrezi Dhaba Sux!"
"One of our favourite restaurants to visit in Todi Mills. The concept is awesome which reflects in their indo western ambience

They have an extensive menu with wide varieties of cuisines and more than enough Veg, Jain and Non Veg options.

Few dishes which you should consider savouring when out here .

Macaroni with cheese :
An impeccable presentation and taste within this all time favourite classic bae of ours .

Spike spiced cheese fondue :
It has a spicy after taste wrapped within the creamiest chesse fondue we have ever tried .

Butter Garlic Mushroom :
Again a hot and fabulous classic dish. Indeed a paradise for all you mushroom lovers.

Triple Schezwan Rice :
They have a very...read more"

"Angrezi Dhaba, the restaurant chain is known for celebrating the Indian spices and the authenticity of culinary diversity from the world. This chain of restaurants enjoys a huge fan following owing to the appetizing fusion menu they offer. The dhaba style cooking brings the best of Indian and international dishes.

We visited Angrezi Dhaba-Lower Parel, for the authentic Dhaba experience in the business district. The multi colored ambiance, quirky visuals, Bollywood posters, the swings and the large screens adds to the charm making it the fun place for party & family gatherings.

"Be it party with friends & dinner date Angrezi Dhaba is the best place.. Recently I had dinner with wife & we totally loved the vibes.. Ambiance is colourful & crowd here is lively.. We tried Cocktails Mumbai Addiction & Toofani, which were perfect to set the mood & then binged on Cheese Kurkure Kebab & Thread Chicken.. For mains we ordered Murg Kalimirch Tikka masala which was so delicious that we finished it with rotis in 5 mins.. last in desserts we tried rabdi which was not too sweet but just right. Thanks to Suraj for excellent service & food suggestion.. Do Visit & Enjoy with your loved ones."

"Angrezi Dhaba provides a delightful culinary experience. The Butter Chicken is a rich, flavorful dish with tender chicken immersed in a creamy tomato-based sauce. The Tandoori Chicken is perfectly marinated, resulting in a smoky and succulent taste. Shahazahani Murgh offers a unique blend of spices, creating a savory and aromatic delight.

The Pain Killer cocktail is a refreshing accompaniment, skillfully crafted with balanced flavors. The Sizzling Brownie is a sweet ending to the meal, featuring a warm brownie topped with ice cream and a sizzling chocolate sauce.

"Cocktails:
Mumbai addiction: I had Mumbai addiction which comprised of vodka, cranberry juice, lime zest, sweet and sour mix.
It was sweet and tasty just like a cranberry vodka.

Toofani: also had toofani which comprised of spiced dark rum, Cointreau, orange juice and cinnamon.
The drink was very refreshing as in winter citrus gives that much needed kick.

Cheese Kurkure kabab: it was crumbly kabab style cheesy just right. It was like a namkeen cookie crumbling in your mouth and the green chutney that accompanied it was so fresh!!!

Paneer sharabi had vodka on paneer with fired up vodka. The paneer was nice and firm with an after taste of vodka. When he torched the vodka it gave the...read more"

The food is good with good quality . Service is fast and wonderful ambiance.
"Had a meal worth 5000

Would say only one of the creamy curries was good.

Too dark of a place. Soup,starters taste average. Person taking order tries to convince to order more even if you don't want.

Cocktails worth 600 were avoidable too.

The sizzling brownie was pathetic with rock like brownie and burnt nuts."
"avergae and unhygenic. most dishes were not available. food was cold. service was terrible, they didnt even bring water on time"
Anil the waiter is the best and the ambience and food is nice must visit and try out the lollypop ani Biryani they are best..
"Was Great time at Angrezi Dhaba, Mr Anil Gave us great service and made us enjoy our dinner. We were a group of 12 ppl."
good services
Had a great time here with my family. The food and service is very good. Anil served us and he was very warm and humble.
"Quality of food served wasn't good
Ordered Chinese and sauce available were stale kept for months probably
Not going again"
"restaurant Scam, We book seats through Zomato gold. When we arrived, the restaurant denied that they don't accept payment through Zomato. What a big scam. please avoid this restaurant."
Ravi is a really humble guy
"Wanted to call for a draught beer pitcher. The waiter denied us to give it for the price mentioned on the menu if the Zomato offer is used. Upon asking, his response was unsatisfactory and was impolite at the least. We tried reasoning with him but he said this is what our policy is and the beer pitcher can't be ordered. We ended up having Mutton kheema biryani which was decent in taste"
"The ambience of the restaurant was very welcoming. the food is as promised, and the service is prompt and personalised. A shout out to Anil, who was our server for the night and he made the experience more enjoyable."
it was fabulous dine In angrezi dhaba..food was awesum we order shrabi kebab and Tikka biryani mind-blowing taste

"Horrible resturant and filthy toilet, they changed attitude as soon as we said the table is booked through Zomato and dint accept the payment by Zomato app, Finally had to pay in Cash without discount"
"The top sections had nearly 8 tables there are 4 waiters standing but order is taken by only one the other 3 are just statues ‚Ä¶.. The service is quite slow Cus one waiter was serving 4 tables ‚Ä¶.. it took us 1 hour to place our order to‚Ä¶

The food is fabulous, the music was too loud for a resto ‚Ä¶. We choose this place thinking we could nicely sit drink eat and talk‚Ä¶. But even the waiter couldn‚Äôt hear us while taking the order ‚Ä¶.."
