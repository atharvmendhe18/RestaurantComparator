Fish cutlet - Surprised and disappointed that Ahura failed to maintain the quality and taste of their food. Couldnt tell if there was even any fish in it...

cannot get better
The chicken Farcha was good. Cheese straws were nice but more like cheese Khari than cheese straws. However the mutton cutlet was a real let down. it was very diff from what I used to order.

"I order regularly from this bakery. Here is my review of the items I have tried:
1. Chicken Sandwich - excellent
2. Mutton/chicken cutlet - too spicy
3. Mutton kebabs - too spicy
4. Tandoori chicken roll - too spicy
5. Fish cutlet - too spicy
6. Chicken mayo roll - Good"
The sandwich is very sweet
