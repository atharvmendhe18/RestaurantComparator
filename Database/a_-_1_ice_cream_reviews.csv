I had ordered total 11 kulfi candyâ€™s and 1 ice cream slice restaurant delivered only 7 candyâ€™s 4 candyâ€™s are missing from order. Trying to call the restaurant but not answering. When contacted with Zomato costumer support they said that 4 candyâ€™s are out off stock. If u doesnâ€™t have the item then how can you show ghem in order menu. And restaurant not going to inform about it that they donâ€™t have the same after paying full amount. They just going to stole our money. Trying to cheat us. Such a fraud restaurant. Not recommending to any one. This unethical people only wants to make money at any cost
A_1 ice-cream is located at Ghatkopar west. They serves ice-cream. When ever we want to eat ice-cream. We visit this place. They serves delicious ice-cream.
"They have variety of kulfi's ,all freshly made !
This place is actually near pant nagar. Can be called 90 feet road!
The service is really fast.
Home delivery is also convenient as they put dry ice along with the ice cream.
And the best thing is rocket icecream. ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°"
I just love their Faluda and Roll Ice Cream. I have ordered their Falooda many times. The packaging is nice. It doesnâ€™t spill off. Love the chocolate flavour specially
"A-1 at Ghatkopar is all known for its creamy kulfi. More then 20 variety of kulfi. Ranging from 15 to 80 rs. Any function at home or society ice cream is always ordered from A-1 more over they deliver it with out prior payment or deposit in case of bulk orders also.

Coming to ice cream have tried there Mali in most of the cases and it tastes really creamy and yumm ..!!"

"This ice-cream joint is so famous and it serves you one of the best ice-creams. Tried their ice-creams months back when i visited ghatkopar. And i totally loved it.

The chocolate & strawberry flavoured ice-creams were amazing and liked by me. Will visit here soon"

Ordered special cassata and 6-in-1 kulfi. They are very creamy and nice overall. Flavor mixes can be a bit better though. But value for money at what they charge.
"One of the best dessert, open till 1:00am different variety of ice creams, always been in love with desserts. Life would not have been interesting without ice cream being invented"
"Tried tuti-fruity slice kulfi, it was the the worse kulfi I ever had. Tasted extremely artificial. I think they themself should taste it before selling. 0/5"
I had a pan masala kulfi and my friend had a tutifooti kulfi. Tooti footy kulfi was sooo synthetic and excessively strong essensce. It was downright disgusting! Pan masala kulfi wasn't good either. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Major Avoid!
"I only order / have Special Malai Kulfi from this place. None other ever

This particular one - they make it awesome

5 stars is for the Kulfi itself and Zomato amazing express delivery."
good taste
"I ordered for 125 Kesar Pista Kulfis for a function but they delivered all Malai kulfis. Since it was a function and wouldn't allow guests to go without dessert we managed with the same. Appreciate the timely delivery, however, some of them had turned green (at several patches) hence had to discard."
best taste in best price...
A1 has a good variety of kulfis. One best thing about a1 is they are open til late in night. Kulfis are also reasonable. Quality of kulfi is good as well. We tried their mix kulfi and malai kulfi. Both were good.
Nice delivery but very late
"Never buy from this place. They are cheaters. I had ordered 5 kulfis, they sent me only 3. They cut my call when I mentioned about it. Didn't get any refund. Never buy from here. I request everyone of you."
good
Good variety of icecreams
ok ok taste
ok
very good...&.... always.... quality maintain....
good
"It's a ice cream junction for the middle class (don't get me wrong)

But they have many good options

I can recommend :
Malai ice cream

And best icecream award goes to

""Rajbhog""

Try it"
pathetic service and staff misbehaves. very disappointed with the service. would not recommend to get anything from here.
"Heaven for people having late night craving for icecream at affordable price. They have different flavours of kulfi and ice- cream.
I have tried black currant, swiss cake,chocolate and roasted almonds. Trust me you can try any flavour of this place without getting disappointed."
value for money ðŸ˜Š
"5 flavour kulfi, pista kulfi, kesar kulfi, Butterscotch falooda, Chocolate falooda

One of the best things about this ice cream parlour is that they are open till late night ( last we had is at 1.30 am)
Staff are very friendly and ready to serve. Fast service and amazing taste of flavours of their kulfi is the only thing which makes this place great
Their faloodaâ€™s are excellent
Quality: 4/5
Service :5/5
Ambience : 4/5"
the taste of the kulfi is really average. I order for a home delivery. I order for a kulfi casatta and mixed kulfi. both kulfi failed to impress me. it came in a news paper packing. I don't think I will order again.
"Major Kulfi cravings place guys! It is an old school place famous for their fresh fruit and fresh cream (very creamy) kulfis. Can't really care about the ambience when the ice cream totally drowns your senses. Thodasa reinvention happening in the menu with some Swiss ice cream(some cake ground in ice cream) and fresh strawberry kulfi with a tutti fruity ice cream that we tried last week. Nothing glamorous, nothing fancy. Just Some authentic flavours and textures. Keeps us coming back even if it's really late hours.
Not all days do you want to go to a place where you'd experience crazy packaging with the preparation view with smoke and fire. Sometimes you just want to have the experience...read more"
"Tried Malai Cream and Pista Badam from A1 Ice cream...

Taste was good with good quantity also very pocket friendly....

One time visit is worth.."
"I have been eating Kulfis from A-1 for the last 8 to 10 years and they have been consistently good. The Rajbhog, the kesar pista, the anjeer, the roasted almond , the malai cream and many more, all of them spectacular. They come at under Rs 40 a slice, neatly wrapped. They deliver across Ghatkopar and I ensure I have my freezer stocked at all times."
