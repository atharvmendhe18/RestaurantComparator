Been eating from Vinay since years but the quality has been not up to the mark. The misal tasted weird plus the pav was as hard as brick and the lassi was too sweet than usual.

"Pao was ordered separately with misal but is missing from order.
Restaurant apologised and offered to refund 4 rs but not the 120 wasted on misal.
How does anyone eat misal without pao.
Not ordering from here anytime again."
No pao sent. How does one eat miles without pao.

"the spicy liquid in puneri misal always falls short by little qty for mixing, so we can't enjoy the proper proportion of mixers ... its always falling short for orders for parcel."

TOO spicy.
The food here is too good. A very stomach filling place. The place offers a good range of food. The rates are very very reasonable to try.
