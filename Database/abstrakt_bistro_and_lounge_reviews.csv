"for a friend's birthday we thought of going to this place given they have a lounge upstairs and a dedicated dance floor and of course Zomato Gold üòä

Location -
I am sure many people have seen /been to this place.
Although the best landmark can be Surana Sethia Hospital. This place is next to it.

Food -
The food here was average! Nothing to brag about. We opted for Paneer Chilly, few of chicken items.
Everything was okish.

Drinks -
They are bit on a higher side in terms of drinks pricing. So do check menu before ordering.

Service -
The service was way too slow. We had to remind them for every dish, for min 2 times.

Overall an okish place if you wanna dance and care less about food &...read more"
"Location : Near Reliance Digital, Suman Nagar

Ordered : Veg- Kung Pao Cottage cheese,Crispy okra, Desi Pizza
Non veg - Kung Pao Chicken Style, Chicken Salt and Pepper, Chicken BBQ Pizza.
Egg cheese omelette, peanut chats

Review : Abstrakt has an amazing collection of food. Every dish here was amazingüíù
Veg starters are just Excellent here. Desi Pizza was not upto the mark.
Non veg starters were ok ok. BBQ Pizza was one of the best ones had. The thin crust was good for sometime but when its cold it becomes very hard and dry. Cheese omelette was amazing

Other views : Cozy and artistic Ambience. Service is little slow. Price is reasonably and in line with all other restaurants. They...read more"
"The place is located on highway so not very difficult to find. We were 5 frnds on a Saturday night here & the place was totally dead. Hardly 2-3 tables more were there. They don't play music on demand as they have a playlist which is being played so you can't change songs.
Food is average nothing to go for. We had ordered a Chinese chicken dish which was super bakwas & hard so we went for tandoor which was ok ok. The chicken they use is quite hard no fun in food. Alcohol is very expensive but they just have only 3 beers in menu total... No Bira n all good beers available.
Totally not worth it."
"Complete Disaster !!!!!!

We went here on a Saturday night . There is nothing which will ever take us back to this place !

Food - Way below average ... Not fresh .
Paneer was stale and simply awful.

Ambience - Just average .

Staff - Not bothered . No manners .

Even after complaining to the manager , they didn't care much .

Chief Foodie Officer -
1) I guess this place should really train the staff in terms of serving , talking and behaving . That's the most important thing in an hospitality industry .
2) Fresh food is something the management needs to look into. How can you not inspect the food from time to time ????

Very disappointed. We left the place after having the...read more"
"Coming here for a second time. The place is actually pretty decent, but rarely crowded. The service is a bit slow. The food - not one of the strong points. We called for Onion rings and Brushcetta. Both were below par. The brushcetta was filled with a pesto sauce that was too overpowering, and there was no cheese on it. The onion rings were extremely oily, and not great tasting.
The drinks - I called for a margarita - that was way way too strong. I asked the waiter to dilute it a bit - it was like drinking vodka neat!! The other drink , a mojito, was good.
Overall, they need to up their game in terms of service and food, otherwise I don't see this place gathering a lot of votes."
"Never knew that don't judge a book by it's cover stuff applied to food haunts..Chembur Abstract..nice place..especially post 7pm
It's a different ambience
Guys must go! Great food,drinks,service n so so easy on the pocket!
More power to you guys! Cheers"
Not worth visiting. Did not liked food at all. Panner used in food was too hard. I went at 10:00 pm n orded cheese chilli toast but they did not has bread.so was not able to serve.vegetarian does not have much choice.
Service and quality has gone down... For a regular all these years it's been a bad experience ... Something as basic as a Caesar salad too has gone bad
A best place to hang out late night with friends. I love their out of the world kheema pizza and Juggernaut. The music is good but the space for dance floor is a bit small. I often go their for kheema pizza.
"Not many people are aware of this place.. we went on a weekend and there was hardly anyone around. This place is clearly underrated.. the food was very good and since there were very less people around, the place felt peaceful and private.. the staff is good too.. it's near the highway and hence alcohol has been banned.. overall a good hangout place (if you want a place less crowded and peaceful)"
"Quiet expensive in my opinion.
We just had starters and didn't try out the rest of the menu.
Dil khush kebab was awesome. Must try. (Pic attached below)
Dijon herb chicken was okay .
Friendly staff even though they don't really know how to communicate properly. These dishes which we ordered were suggested to us with the staff itself. So kudos to them :D"
Its a nice place to hangout with pretty cheap drinks during happy hours.Out of all the stuff we ordered Chicken bao was the best.Ambience is good too.
"Bad service, less serving staff so tge take loads of time to get the food. Ambiance is ok. We had ordered pizza mexicano and they took an hour to prepare so we get that take away and when had that at home, ot was fully loaded with chilly flakes and the taste was pathetic. Won't recommend it to anyone ever."
"Abstrakt is an abstract place. You would love being here. A great place to have an urban unwind.

Food :- 7.5/10
The food here was not that great. It was just about OK.
The salad was good.

MUST TRY :- Sizzler

Ambience :- 9.5/10
The ambience was awesome. There is a SWING table where you can swing as u enjoy your drink. All my ratings are for this
Feature.
The bar is detailed and the food options are too.

Service:- 7/10
The food was served so so so late while only 2other tables were occupied. Sad.
The staff was warm though.

The Swing table is all you would want to grab here.

Happy Lounging to You !!!"
"I had heard a lot about this place so finally decided to visit. The place is a difficult drinking joint divided into two floors. The ground floor is more of a bar area and the top floor is a lounge. Nothing much special about the decor very generic. The food here is very average not much variety in the menu. Had ordered barbecue chicken pizza, and the waiter ended serving as an Indian style, when we asked why so the waiter ended up saying that this is barbecue pizza."
Shocked to know that we have to pay extra for mobbing the floor. My kid puked as not keeping well and I m asked to pay 250 Rs extra for cleaning. Worst experience ever and poor hospitality. Steward do not even carry smile on face if asked for anything. Will never recommend to any1 ever.
Worst experience .....food quality is average the cost doesn't justify food . I recommend not to visit the lounge to anyone.the service time is very late.
The ambience is amazing with the swings on the first floor. The service was okay knowing the less crowd. Except garlic breads theres nothing more good to eat.
"Looking for a place to unwind and catch up with some cricket? Abstrakt Bistro in Chembur is the place to go! The pretty decor, soft lights and good music all made up for a very chill ambience.
We started off by ordering Amritsari Fish Tikka which was soft, crunchy and cooked to perfection, followed by Kung Pao Chicken which is essentially chicken tossed in a tangy kung pao sauce and some creamy white sauce pasta.
For drinks we tried the S.B. Martini which is a vodka based cocktail infused with strawberry crush and basil. A bit too much of vodka and less of other flavors to our liking.
Overall we had a nice experience and were happy with the service.
Foodscapades Rates 8.5/10"
I came with my friends..i have to say boring atmosphere and not happening food.. really disappointed..not at all good music and the service ..I won't recommend anyone for this place..
"One of the best places I've been to recently. Great ambience and great food. This is the place to go if you just wanna chill out, drink and hog on some spectacular food. The cheesy fries is definitely a must have but try just everything else on the menu, it's just superb. This place didn't even go wrong with the Virgin Mojito. The staff is friendly and courteous. The owner Satvik is chilled out and on his feet all the time to makes sure you enjoy. I'd recommend this place if you're in Chembur or anywhere in the city (Then you have to go to chembur)"
"I had been to this lounge with a friend on one of the Sundays last month. At the time of billing they asked me to swipe the card twice as the first attempt did not get through. I told them that i have received the msg for deduction already; they assured me that in case the money is not refunded by the bank they will return the extra payment credited to them.

Now it has almost been a month that I have been following up with the staff and management for returning the extra payment and the response is very poor. Once they even asked me to come to their place one more time instead of offering to payback.

This is by far the worst customer experiences I have had with any place in Mumbai...read more"
"Nice place, service and food. It's quite an attractive place from exteriors with its bright yellow branding. Coming to the food, their Gulabi chicken kebab is a bit overrated being dry and spiceless. BBQ chicken pizza is amazing, so is the grilled fish sizzler in peri peri sauce. Pricing is a bit high, but there are smarter ways of getting discounts. One is use Eatmigo app to reserve table. They offer good discounts based on time of reservations."
"I suppose it was one of the very few cherished places in Chembur or its vicinity, now it has got some real tough competitors. Though it stands out top on my list, especially if its a soccer match or a live cricket screening. Place is comparatively huge as it also has 1st floor area. The food is yummy, french fries being my best safe bet always. They are hot, and crunchy and tastes just perfect with ketchup and mayo. Booze is not at all expensive, plus they also give offers on domestic drinks. If you are visiting this place for first time and if its 8pm or more, take my words go on the first floor seating. They got swings upstairs, Im sure you will love it. We ordered Fresh lime mojito. It...read more"
"Patroning this place for more than 15 years, from good old ADARSH-RESTO BAR & now ABSTRAKT...Being a FOODIE & socialising Drinker, this joint in CHEMBUR (near SUMAN NAGAR) is a must visit for all Age groups...Great place for Parties...Nice ambience & Music can be as per your request-as DJ has been good from old days...Plays right from English Retro 80s-90s to the new & current Hip-hops...& anything from Bollyhood with a decent Dance-floor....Food is good and the Menu is deligthfully fixed but portions are little wee bit....Good service...Weekends are crowded...better go early to avoid disappointment....CHEERS"
Best place in chembur to hang out.. The swing seating concept is amazing but should have more swings...happy hours should be there everyday from afternoon till evening........
"One of the best lounge in Chembur east
Good service
Quality food
Quality crowd
Nice Music
Only thing they need to work out is on the space and the Dance floor"
"I visited this place on 08-Jun-2017 and before getting the check amount we were told that the 15% discount offer on Axis Cards is no longer valid here. I reported this to Zomato who were kind enough to check with the restaurant and wrote back that the offer is very much valid till date. A total disappointment by Abstrakt :( 

To begin with, they messed up with our fresh lime water - the easiest drink anyone can make.
The chicken sizzler was sufficient enough but they haven't mastered the trick to mix the sauces evenly like most other restaurants do. Some part was good and full of sauce while the remainder was just too dry. Chicken crispy was good enough. The waiter messed up again when...read more"
"Abstrakt bistro is the most amazing place! I loved the ambience thoroughly!
Fries and Pizza üçï is delicious!
They have great variety for non-vegetarians!
Would recommend to visit!"
"We were party of 12 wanted to impress inlaws for first dinner and we landed to this swanky looking lounge . Was impressed with the decor nice swing chairs amazing music bt den realized music is loud for family so we shifted to their bistro section.. was quick in ordering starters and drinks and what their air conditioners are not working .. captain says they have issues in ac *WTH* we where drenched in sweat still there was no apologies from staff side .their captain is hopeless character .food is not great sprite was with fizz chicken biryani was too salty to eat .

A quite place to have beer. Prices r resnabol. Services are quite good. American Fries are the best I ever had. A good place overall when u have a small get together.
I went there on a friday with my school frnds fro mulund.food was ok no that great after that chiken was half baked and was cold too.when we gav main coursw order thay burntthe biryani rice ans it took 45mins to get a simple daal and jeera rice.i was so angry as i hav nvr got such service in abstrakt b4.im a returning customer and to see such things going on it was really embarassing for me in front of my frnds.i literally shouted that day and it was a bad experience.also man power was less.
"Awesome cheese nachos and garlic bread
Less crowded
good for watching match
First floor has music and dance floor sufficient for a group to enjoy
Good place to chill and chat with friends
Service is not that good but compensated by swings as seats on first floor"
Great ambience and a proper place for people interested in both alcohol and food. Chicken kung fao is the must try starter here. Service is proper and attentive. Nice place for a party with friends and colleagues.
"Been here a few times (considering I've got plenty of friends in/around Chembur area). Good place to hang-out and catch some drinks with friends. Crowd is youthful and cool. Once celebrated NYE here (14/15), and that was pretty cool too. Music can be a bit loud sometimes, but the music system is powerful & good. Drinks/Food are good & pricing is reasonable. Service is also good. Overall, all things considered, it's a good quality but reasonable/budget pub in the Chembur area, and a great place for hanging-out with friends & catching some drinks."
"Ambiance is good. Staff friendly. one should go for north Indian rather than Italian
Daal makhani n her tea rice were delicious
Mojito was refreshing"
"Location isnt tat good but inside... Yes its nice...had been there just to chill out with friends on sunday around 5 ish..
They have good mocktails...and their french fries are really good..table next to us had ordered them..like 4-5 times....and we just couldnt resist the smell..
There is this table in the corner...really caught my eye..book shelves at the back and the light over the table....intresting concept..
And swinging chairs on first floor which opens after 6:30 pm...liked tat
Overall a nice place... Might visit soon"
"Nicely done place. Interiors are finely created. It gave a rugged feel and at the same time spelled sophistication.
They have a upper deck as well.
I personally liked the upper deck, but unfortunately couldn't enjoy being there because of some system crisis. So moved down quickly.
Food is decent. After cheesy starters, we moved to main course. Ordered butter panner masala and Naan. Naan was though a little uncooked. No much options for vegetarians. This saddened me a little.
Overall, thumbs up. Go have fun."
"I did not like the smell at the place.. A lil stinky..

Rest the options for the starters were fine.. Quantity was fine.. Options for drinks was good too"
"Was one of Chembur's best kept secrets till a few months back. I have recommended the place to several acquaintances, and wouldn't be surprised if they like me better for it."
The place is quite decent...thought the location is not the best... But it's a good place to spend the evening.. the bistro is better than the lounge though..
"Awesome place to hang out with friends. Chilling ambience, good music and tempting food. One of the best place to visit in locality. Atmosphere is good enough to enjoy every bit."
"When i called them and asked about the offers, i was told alot. But they weren't upto their word. Would not recommend this place at all to anyone."
This place is Just unexpected small but awesome place for a sudden plans with ya friends wr u have good music good food with perfect ambience for date or party.....
"Too expensive given the portions, the so called Loaded Nachos were the worst(multi layery cheese i don't even know what to call it, veggies ? Missing !). Thumbs up to the decor, furniture and ambience. Another place where they levy 'Service Charge' as high as 10% over and above the expensive food. Food needs more creativity and definitely quantity. There are not many options which even the waiter would suggest. All in all, an expensive sports/resto bar kind of a place with nothing similar in atleast 3-5km of its radius - an area to score üòâ"
"The music was ok. The cheesy loaded nachos lived up to all that hype. Well, I would like to see more of this place in the coming days, but for now it was ok. I would also like to see more people at this place, as being the only people there is not something I want to go back to."
I ordered Dal Pakodis and Chana Chaat for evening snacks and o my my.... Delivered hot... Balanced spicy but awesome taste... Ordered for the first time and impressed with the quality of the food... Worth ordering again...
"Ambience. Very good. Upper lounge has swinging chairs and space to tap your feet. Two large screens playing sports is good for sports buffs.
Service- Good and prompt
Food variety - okay. Not too much variety especially in sea food n starters.
Food taste - Good. Nothing too great though.
Pricing - Expensive for the locality. They charge 10 percent service charges also. Proper drinks n food will cost 2000 Rs at least.
Overall - 3 on 5"
"A great place with yummy food. Tried peri peri chicken which was one of the best i have had. Also had chicken sizzlers , which was good. Went there on a saturday around 330 pm. Luckily got served with good food"
"Half the things on the menu are not available.The quantity is very less.
Never again.
Saturday night the place ia empty and would never suggest anyone to go this place
Bad experience"
"Was in abstract Restaurant in month of April , 2016. ambience was good . Music also good ... Service was slow. food quite good . Overall was good experience"
Good for party animals. Loud music and the sound tracks will not let you sit for long. Superb place for dancing! Food was also good. Ambience is okayish. Overall a good experience!
"Attended 'Salsa Nite' organised by Dancing Passions with Vivaswan Parekh.
Efficient and professional service and personel. Music system rocks!
Thank you so much, Abstrakt!"
"We were here for a friends bday party. Good loud music and the ambience of the resto is a perfect combination to make up your mood into a partying one. We had north indian food, some starters and cocktails. The concept of swinging chairs is quite good one. Good service, staff hospitality. Overall a must visit for youngsters and who love loud music."
"We were here for Salsa socials by Dancing Passions and The Phoenix Dance Studio on Thursday night... this place was roaring and how!!
Absolutely smashing music with the dance floor being completely packed right till the music stopped at 12!
The area is very spacious with a beautiful dance floor and the swings seating gives it a nice funky feeling..
Coming to the food and drinks.. it's a value for money place. Reasonable rates with good food. The loaded nachos were absolutely yum.
Who knew Chembur could host such a wonderful dance socials!!
Waiting to be here regularly for lots of dancing and a fun filled ambiance!!
Cheers to Team Abstrakt üòä"
"Went for lunch on 6 Dec 2016 on little app voucher.

Place wa completely empty even at 1:00 in the afternoon.

Tables are large and the area is spacious.

We ordered chicken munchow soup which was very nice.

For starters the waiter advised us chicken dilkhush kebab. It had kebab stuffed inside chicken pieces. It was good but nothing extraordinary. Chicken was fresh but yet was a bit hard when served.

Again on the waiter's suggestion we went for Chicken Kranti. This was more like butter chicken. Tomato based gravy with tiny chunks of chicken. Again this was ok and  nothing extraordinary.

"Just a single word to describe this place ""Worthless"".
Hopeless taste and useless service. Waiters are not at all experienced. No knowlege at all. never going again"
"We were a group of 7 and visited on a Sunday night. We got amazing service and the food was excellent - they were also willing to customise the food for us! We loved the tandoori chicken lollypop, herb crusted fish, kadi patta chicken and galouti kebab which were delicious!! We chose this place because they were open late and were screening the EPL match - overall superb experience, will def visit again!"
"have anything BUT this drink called the 'WAKE UP Call'
haha! disclaimer - it could kill you honestly.

the place though is good for food & value for money,
also, another heads up, don't try the pizzas, its not one of their best really. you might as well save yourself the risk of splurging money unnecessarily, which shall not be pleasing your taste buds after all."
"This place is situated on highway. Easy to locate. I had gone with my friends on Saturday night at 8:30 pm. The place was empty. We were the first to enter. The ambiance was good and seating arrangement was cozy and comfortable. The music was too loud and it was hurting our ears. Let's come to the main thing- Food.
We had ordered
1. Manchow Soup
2. Caribbean Blonde
3. American Fries
4. Jalapeno Burst
5. Desi Pizza
6. Paneer Teriyaki.
Soup was good. Caribbean Blonde was a great mocktail , a proper blend of mango and coconut. American Fries was very similar to Cheese Nachos with Salsa topping. Instead of Nachos , all the toppings was on Fries. The star dish for me was Jalapeno Burst. Very...read more"
I like a place which has good music but not too loud. A place where I would rather want to sit with my friends and talk and relax with light alcohol and food. Abstrakt is just that. I met some of my good friends after a long time at this place. The Music in the BG was pleasant and not loud. The food that we ordered was all good. The staff was prompt and friendly. Will surely be back here..!
"We went to this place in the neighbourhood for dinner. The ambience was okay for a lounge. We ordered mini calzones for starters and a vegetable sizzler. They served calzones which seemed to be pan fried instead of being baked (read too oily) and I couldnt detect any flavour of cheese. The sizzler was okay, but nothing great. The service was pretty bad; they didnt serve water until we had to ask for it, waiter didnt even know about the condiments to be served with the meal. The only thing I felt was savory was the mayo dip (served with the starter after much ado) which I believe is of no credit to the chef!"
"Best value for money for a pub n disco in Chembur.....if you are staying in central and dont want to drive till bandra,juhu for pubs this is the perfect choice...(but you can not compare this with pubs in western suburbs ..which are heavily priced also) .. food options are limited ..but quailty is good. ..Crowd is average .! ..if you want to just chill with your friends its the perfect place..hanging chairs are interesting ..their inhouse cocktails are really good ...ovearall worth to visit !"
Least value for money i've had in several years. Eight tiny pieces of saffron chicken for 329. Not extraordinarily tasty either. And it's listed under gravies but turned up dry
"Amazing pizza. The food was honestly really good, a great surprise as I considered Abstrakt to simply be a 'party place'. Also had the chicken wings and sizzling brownie.

Recommend, definitely. Worth a visit."
"This is my gang's go to place!! I absolutely love it. The food here is great and the alcohol is pretty reasonable. The loaded nachos, chicken satay, and grilled paneer and zucchini...just fab!! This place is never crowded (which gives us the freedom to dance all over the place). We mostly come here to tap our feet on Bollywood numbers. I think I'm gonna ask them for permanent membership, the next time I visit. Lol!! üòú"
"Another neighborhood hood with good ambience. Nothing extraordinary but they serve some good cocktails. The food is average but you can visit for their ambience: swinging chairs for high tables, edison lights and some good decor."
"This is situated in a very conspicuous location of Chembur. The ambience is quite nice, food is decent. The staff is friendly but the service can be little better. Although in a busy place, there is a valet parking available which is quite useful."
"It was a bar and restaurant before Abstract Bistro and Lounge. It's totally a desi place. I bet you won't be bored here with the desi music and enthusiastic people around. I would recommend Fried Okra for bites and veg sabzi for the main course. I must say, this place is reasonable, good food and music together."
"Considering the limited options for hanging out with friends in chembur, situated bang opposite vijay opposie is a good place to try.
Food 3/ 5 ...paneer chilli (paneer was very soft and nice burst of flavours), jalepeno burst (quantity less but tastes good), peri peri chicken (supposed to be the most spicy chicken starter...but it was not at all spicy), desi pizza (loved it), paneer sizzler (complete turnoff. ..disaster! )
Drinks - 4/5 mockatils virgin mojito, cranberry blonde (refreshing drink), KBS (the best of all)
Cocktails classic LIT, margarita - both good!

"Pathetic service. They didn't even offer a glass of water after entering, just handed the menu. Once order is given, they don't even ask if we want anything else. We waited 15 minutes just to pay the bill. After calling 10 times someone comes to even take the order."
"1 is still a rating,if I had the option I would've definitely given this place a negative rating. Very poor service. They didn't even bother to serve water at the start. We waited for around 15 minutes just to make the payment. You guys charged around 500+ rupees in the name of service tax which you absolutely sucked at! Not recommending this place to anyone to help them avoid a miserable time!"
"It's hard to miss this place as it sits on the main street and is brightly lit. It's the perfect place to have a relaxed evening with friends, maybe even catch a game of football or cricket at this cosy bistro. While the options for vegetarians is limited, I'd recommend the exotic veg pizza which was palatable. The staff is friendly and the service is prompt. What stood out to me was the quirky decor of the place and the welcoming ambience. However, the food was a bit of a let down."
"If you feel too lazy to get out of chembur then Abstrakt is the joint.Appetizers actually compliments any drink,be it beer,whiskey,or rum.The ambience is a lit up.The music is a little too loud,but the dance floor is all yours which sums up the place.All over the place is the good to chill with buddies. :)"
Nice place. Had been there during the semi final match between India and West Indies. Food was pretty good. There was no space but still they made special arrangements and accommodated us. Service was crisp in spite of the crowd. Prob the best resto-bar in chembur other than N bar.
"Considering the relatively limited options in Chembur, for a good lounge, Abstrakt would definitely be one of the better ones in the hood, but pales in comparison to other hip spots in town.
Food is good and liquor is reasonably priced. Their local, in house cocktails are an interesting collection and are actually, surprisingly well made. Starters were really nice with a nice touch on the classic fish & chips.
The main course offerings are a solid average- good but nothing exciting.
The interiors are pretty dim with crafty lighting and nicely paneled wood. My only real grouse is that the music was too loud & we couldn't hear each other despite yelling & we left finally with a heavy...read more"

"At first i was not sure if we are going to the right place since we were two families going there and we had 2 small babies ( less than 4 years ).. kids were comfortable... but they did not have a single baby high chair.

However the ground floor set up is not a lounge.

The ambience was slightly electic.

Service was good.

Good quality and taste was very very good. Loved the kung pao paneer and broccoli starters.

Drinks are resonable.

They also have the #loyalty offers...."
"Good Alcohol. Excellent food. Go for the Prawns Koliwada & Penne Arabiatta Pasta. With a distinct cuisine menu, they also serve a vivid range of cocktails. Try visiting during the Happy Hours with one on one free offer on a certain range of alcohol. It's pretty good."
"This place is surely a hidden gem in chembur locality. We have been to the resto, the lounge we did not get a chance to visit as we always had our baby with us but the restaurant is surely one of the best eateries in Chembur.Our first time experience was not that good due to a blunder in the dishes but the owners made sure that we visit again and have a good time.
The place has a very rugged industrial feel, with the open pipes and conduits, some exposed brick work and unfinished walls, industrial lights provide a decent ambience. 
On to the food, we have visited this place multiple times and tried almost everything on the menu( veg and non veg). All the dishes are a must try except the...read more"
"A great place to hang out with friends after the tiring days of work. The interior adds up to the vibe of the place.
The starters are okayish.
A lil hard on your pocket if you're planning of going to get drunk."
"Lounges in Chembur are a totall Rare thing.. and Abstrakt is a real good one for that matter. The Happy Hours are a beautiful bonus.. Pints are One on One, though not on MRP. We called for some Crunchy peanut dish along with Nachos and some beers.. it went along really well! Munchies with Beer were Awesome. I only didn't like the vibe of the place.. the decor isnt thaaat cool.. but the grafitti is still cool."
"Good food, Drinks okay, Loud music

T was a girls' night out, ordered some Sangria. It wasnt good enough so asked the waiter, he got us a better batch.
Still no good, called the manager, got us a better batch.
Lota young crowd, good ambience.
Best - Appetizers & risottos
They got these swing table which are awesome, and the music was so loud that at some time we were texting each other :D"
"A decent place to find in chembur ! The ambience of the bar is quite nice. Dark and shady dimly lit lights with live screening of matches and well stocked bar. The service and food is nice as well. The music gets too loud though , gets on your nerves when you chill for more than two hours ! :p overall , satisfied customer ! üëç"
The place is really well made. It's a saving grace for anyone who lives in Chembur. They have like swing seats which are pretty cosy. It gets lively on the weekends. They have match screenings happening all the time. I would give this place a solid 4.
