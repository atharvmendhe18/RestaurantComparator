The food here has been alright as for the orders I had placed preciously. But recently I had placed an order asking for a home delivery by calling the restaurant up directly early in the evening at about 5pm. The food shows up an hour late at my doorstep. Any which way being very hungry I continued to unpack my lunch to 5 pieces of chicken chili like I paid 200bucks for 5pieces of chicken chili. I spoke to the restaurant about the same and they said they'd send a person to check. That person stood outside my door step and opens the parcel and counts every piece and is like this is the quantity served in a very rude way by sticking his fingers in my parcel that I ordered when as for a...read more
Very good for chciken starters..a regular bar with standard interiors..ofcourse wud have the noises durin peak hours..good for lunch parties for non veggers!!!
"A quick review for a quick lunch here.
We had the paneer tikka masala with naan.
The quantity was good considering the price and the taste was also good enough, wish it was a little spicier but nevertheless enjoyed it.
The naan was your typical naan, that got a little hard after some time"
Drink some beer have some food and enjoy with your friends best place to chill out with child beer watching cricket ... Food is delicious and value for money
"One of the pocket friendly resturant in the neighbourhood. Good place for team lunches. Have tried most of the items on their menu and all of them are good. Only advice, wont suggest having prawns as they dont clean it properly, My personal favourites are Butter chicken, Pahadi kebab, chicken lollipop, chicken laziz. Overall a nice budget friendly place."
"This hotel is exactly at the Nerolac circle.
They serve good North Indian food at affordable price with great taste
Fast home delivery is what I would recommend"
Raviraj has been my favourite place for booze in LP. Very close to the office. Costing wise its economical. The food here is really good. Do try their Butter Chicken - Highly Recommended. Staff & Service is really nice.
"It isn't a typical family restaurant. It may seem a little shady but it's just the overall ambience. And hygenic and well maintained for the price you pay. Extremely easy to locate. Polite staff and manger. They can customise the food according to your choice. Their food generally has oil on the higher side so while ordering I ask them to use less oil.
Coming to the food, the taste is good. But the point worth noting is their quantity. They serve good food in good quanity so total value for money."
"Small restaurant with bar attachment with 7-8 tables. Decent food, decent price, not a typical family restaurant, home delivery is available. Try their seafood items, kebabs pretty good."
"Because I was in mood to eat some roadside 'indian' Chinese, the spicy schezwan types taste. So I ordered Egg Schezwan Noodles. Though it was egg noodles, it had chicken in it. The chicken was too rubber like. I ended up not eating the chicken pieces. Apart from that the taste was good, as I expected."
Ambiance awesome... in AC food wallahaaa awesome and service is also good I had Lollipop and roti and chicken dish good hotel in Worli area.
"My favorite restaurant whenever I'm towards town side. This is a very old restaurant and bar and quite popular in lower parel area. Restaurant has been renovated but prices were hardly affected.
The main course is very much like other restaurants but they win in their starters which are quiet reasonable and unique. Me and my wife go there often just for starters and soup and that is enough no need for main course.
So for starters I give it a 5"
