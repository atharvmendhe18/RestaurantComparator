"why are the eclairs always a hit or miss. today the eclair was TERRIBLE. the pastry was hard like cardboard, barely any fresh cream, terrible. on other days the eclairs are good."
Delicious and yummy üòã

"I had ordered Ferrero Rocher pastry but in no way did it taste like that. Just a regular chocolate cake with a Rocher chocolate on top. Also, the pastry wasn't fresh"

I order almost everyday from birdys but today's order was very bad and very badly packaged the sandwich and the chicken crossaint came in foil and taste was also not good
The cake was spoiled. It was all smashed

Birdy's has the best cakes. It had a rich taste.
It truly was a delicious treat. I love Birdy's cakes!
The food was absolutely exquisite. I have never had such good pastries in my life. Really good dessert.

I had mentioned to add happy anniversary but it wasn‚Äôt added
stale and smelly

"the cakes were great, although, a little on the expensive side. but the eclairS are described as PLURAL, and only 1 was sent. i feel short-changed. i don't feel that 1 measly eclair was worth the price; if there were 2, then yes."
It gave nausea and vomiting

The cakes here are my favourite!

Received stale Croissant. And poor packaging.
why was the cake heated? No such instructions were given. it has fully melted
I have asked them to put a birthday message but they didn‚Äôt.. Also tried calling them but no one answered the phone.
Stale food
French chocolate exclaims were soft n not tasting good n chicken jungle sandwich did not taste good
"We visited Birdys shop in Bandra. It‚Äôs a cute little desert shop with a lot of options, bakery items and pastries. We had the dutch truffle and the red velvet cake.. we like the dutch truffle more. We also had chocolate eclairs which was coated with chocolate. Overall good choice to visit."
Really good quantity and quality for the price. Taste was good too.
it took 5 mins to deliver but brought cold
""
Excellent!

"taste is really bad
I'm a fan of birdy pastries but this cake is the worst
really poor food quality not even."
the cake was awesome and it was beyond the best. the taste of the cake was mouthwatering. But the size was small otherwise 10 on 10
"The quality can be improved, the quality of birdys has dropped considerably"
did not receive Nagpur orange chocolate slice
the cakes are amazing here. the dutch chocolate truffle was my favourite. and its very reasonable as well . will highly recommend this place
