"1. the tawa roll was difficult to eat as it was sliced diagonally. so pieces kept falling while eating. 2. it was super oily! 3. the masala taste was below average. 4. i got digestion problem due to this and ended up going to loo twice!! still i have a loss of appetite.
tikka cheese roll was far better."
Mutton keema was raw.
"khaane mein namak bahut jyaada tha

there was too much salt in the food"

Not A Good Portion Quantity Was Less And Not Up To The Mark

not good as expected
Good Enough for 1 person and good food good life.
again it was sent with green chutney amd not the cream as usual
It was not creamy tikka as usual some other chutney was added on the roll
"Apna had been one of our favourite joints before lockdown as it had delicious, hygienic food at affordable prices but it is definitely not the case now!!! the quality has definitely deteriorated."
Wrong order was sent and then was replaced with the new one. Mutton kebab roll was poor. rest was fine
Very nice
"Apna‚Äôs rolls is a small outlet in fort which is always flocked by people. They serve some great rolls and tikkas.

I highly recommend the Chicken Cream Roll and Chicken Malai Breast. The pieces of chicken are very tender and will simply melt in your mouth.

You may also try malai seekh biryani, chicken tikka, Baidabaty roti and offcourse chocolate mousse.

They make their own cream and other sauces. The owner is very friendly and will recommend you based on your taste."

Food was ok. The roll lacked flavour was a bit bland but was not bad.
taste is awesome....less oil and lot of chicken pieces. .. Thank you....
"Pulaw is good
Egg burji is like semi gravy its very bad experience"
"I order from Apna‚Äôs minimum once a week! The food here is to die for. They‚Äôve got the best Bheja Ghotala , juicy seekh kebabs and by far the best Chicken Cream Tikka Roll in Bombay! This brand serves you great taste and is definite value for money! Go check it out if you‚Äôre around fort or even order from here if you‚Äôre craving Indian food!"
Last time main order kiya tha mutton tikka 12 PC's itna ghatiya tha ke poncho mat na to sahi banaya tha sab kuch kachcha tha aur mutton to tha hi nahi sab chttre bhara hua tha ek 3rd class tha meri life ka sab se bed experience
Roll quality was good but that green chutney inside the roll spoilt the taste of the kabab meat inside. Need a milder chutney or just some butter inside of the roti will do.
"only 4 picess given when they promice for 6
piese , this is not expectable"
platter could be better! either put big regular pieces or increase the quantity
it was creamy delicious roll I ever had Nice food üòã
"completely cold food, dirty packaging and top of all only 1 roll was sent, no help from Zomato onthat matter as well,
pathetic food and pathetic service"
"The food is tasteless, no spices nothing. Only sour taste, quality of roti was bad."
