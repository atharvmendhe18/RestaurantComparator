Good food and fast delivery in juhu
the food was sub par in taste and quality. Restaurant hygiene was highly questionable seeing the state of wash area and restroom. A visit to this restaurant can be avoided at all costs
very bad taste

Excellent food

One of the worst food i had..
The bhaji was very spicy. Shiv Sagar has lost its reputation of making good pav bhaji. The evening was spoiled due to this gross and callous approach of Shiv Sagar. The kids had to forego their meals. Older adults switched to other options due to overly spicy Pav Bhaji . I‚Äôll never ever order from Shiv Sagar.
Very oily and spicy food.
