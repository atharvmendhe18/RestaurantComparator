tasty food ... good good quality
portion and quality of the food is not good
incorrect order

Could only give one star as this was minimum. this outlet should not be even listed. yes that bad biryani. Don't go by the picture in Zomato.
""
I order every time from this restaurant but this time the quantity was way less not acceptable.
""
Food was not as per Zomato ratings. Taste was ok ok

Mutton was hard
"They serve very good food and I order regularly from them. I like their Chicken Sukka and Kaleji Sukka very much. 8 out of 10 times they serve fresh food but today unfortunately it was 2 out of 10th, so the food was not so fresh but it was ok."
""
My favourites are Chicken Sukka and Chicken Liver Sukka.. Perfect taste.. 8 out of 10 times items were fresh.
Can improve packaging
