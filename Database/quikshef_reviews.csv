"New fast food joint opened up in Thane. I really like their cheese dabeli, it looked good as well as tasted good. Their chole kulche were nice. I liked the garlic bread as well, pizza was fine. I loved both the shakes, the chickoo milkshake and the cold coffee"

"The place has got really nice variety of menu and food at value pricing. The serving style is super attractive and homely. The taste is equally good and had home style blend to it.
Try their Mini Samosa and Cheese Dabeli. Delicious Taste! The plus point here is the rates they serve food at. It naturally grabs in the crowd. Chole kulcha is must try! The Chole are awesome with a superb mix of masala and spices and moderate oil. The kulchas are soft and hot and you feel like stuffing yourself till you burst. Best place to hangout with friends and enjoy tasty and pocket friendly food! Highly recommended."

"quikshef from thane is introducing North indian, Delhi styled chaat to mumbai.
they have house speciality for laung latta chaat and khasta chaat.
we tried the both and totally loved the khasta one.
the laung latta is bit on salty side.

we also tried chef's special pizza and 2 drinks,
both cold coffee and mango thickshake were amazing.

thank you.
Happy fooding."
We were excited by looking at the place and menu. But disappointed in our first visit itself. They just fry the frozen food and serve it. The wrap was so disgusting it was just mashed potatoes. The 1 star which I have given is for cheese corn samosa. The price were less but it was not at all worth even that much money. Never ever recommending this to someone.
