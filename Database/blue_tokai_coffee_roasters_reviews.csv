Superb food and service by Rishikant. We went with our 1 yo and the cafe was very accomodating
it is a very nice place to enjoy a coffee with a good conversation
Worth the visit

Half of my coffee was spilled. It even spoiled the morning bun that I had ordered along with it :(
"There was way too much ice in my drink. By the time it arrived, the drink was extremely diluted. I can barely taste the sweetness of the condensed milk and it has a very watery texture. This is not up to the mark at all."

Asked for extra hot coffee and got coffee that was cold instead.

paprika grilled chicken sandwich didn't have the cheese it had when I had dined in. very different.
Coffee had spilled in the bag. Mocha didn‚Äôt have enough coffee tasted more like hot chocolate.

Whenever and wherever I am going for my meeting with clients I can only see blue Tokai now everywhere and the best part now is their service. So happy to see that staff themselves are so smiley and truly believe in my happiness as well. Loved the staff‚Äôs humble gesture Thank you girls Rutuja and Twinkle for making my day ü•≥ü•≥

I like basil pesto pasta it's so tasty
Excellent coffee and food but service is really bad. Staff running around like headless chicken and busy catering to the long queue of delivery orders. Skip the dining and order at home I guess.
The Latte made by Barista Ramesh was amazing
"Horrible experience. We ordered mozzarella pesto egg croissant sandwich, ice mocha and Berry smoothie. They mention quick breakfast but it literally took 30 mins for sandwich, it was ready and kept at the counter and it took additional 5-7 mins just to take it from counter and serves us at table. After placing order for sandwich they were discussing whether it can be possible and somehow they managed to serve us but did mentioned that menu you are referring is outdated. I mean seriously üòê Ice mocha was tasting like horlicks. Berry smoothie was too sour. Actually it was packed bottle of smoothie they just pour it in glass and serve. Overall it is a big no no. Do not post the feedback...read more"

"Horrible experience with ordering a quick breakfast here. We ordered for Guacamole on toast, Mushroom scrambled eggs, cold coffee & a cortado. We were told that it‚Äôll take 10-15 mins for the food to be made, it took more than 30 mins. And when the food came, the egg was smelly.

I think caf√©s in Powai have taken customers for granted. Seek a quick change in attitude."

"Service is good, staff is good, Vietnamese Iced coffee (must try). Overall best experience."
Smoked chicken ham & cheese croissant is to die for üëå

no coffee. all spilt. all food soggy and wet

Please do NOT pack chips along with the sandwiches. There are better ways to send. The chips were soggy and moist due to back packaging
""
We had an iced latte and a coffee milkshake- very well made. This is my go to place to have coffee.

"the coffee delivered by Ankita was brilliant.

"The amount of salad to go is too small for the price. I often visit the same Powai store and order the same salad, but find that it is about half the size of the salad is provided in-store. Seek immediate improvement."

I really like their chimchurri chicken sandwich because the meat was very fresh and tender. Croissant very fresh as well. Must recommended.
The coffee was spilled
Crispy flaky and perfect pain au chocolate

Had asked for less coffee and vanilla syrup as well .. it was really bad taste
