Sandwich wasn‚Äôt good at all. Food delivered was very cold.
"The chicken in the pasta was a little hard, plus the quantity felt a little less than usual. Otherwise the taste of everything was amazing"

"Came here for the food, never coming back due to cockroaches. Disappointed to find one on the table during breakfast one day. When I informed the server & showed her the same, all she said was ‚Äòsorry‚Äô."
Not that great

"Portion size was little small however taste was superior.
Hair strands found in the packing tape"

The cutlery is missing.
"The smoothie bowl was bitter, probably because of the nuts that were over roasted. The orange turned bitter too. All in all, a bad food experience. The smoothie had way too much banana in it."
The best vanilla custard donut I have ever had
"Pain au chocolate was very stretchy and couldn‚Äôt even eat properly. It felt like I am eating a naan. Really spoiled my mood. This is not my first experience of this sort. I understand it can‚Äôt be fresh out of oven, but it shouldn‚Äôt be so stretchy."
it was just‚ù§Ô∏è
Ordered pasteries for someone and this is how it got delivered ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
it was awesome

"The restaurant did not send whipped cream, which is part of the order. When you're selling a pancake for 470, this is just not done."
""
"Pathetic delivery experience, entire soup was spilled but despite providing relevant pictures as proof Zomato didn‚Äôt even address the feedback and kept asking to share more pictures"

The Cake was not fresh at all
""

"tooo bad experience, pastry not at all fresh, staff wass tooo rude not atall listening to the review and was giving answer back that we have this type of cake only if you want to have then this is the only one, we have ordered a hot chocolate only water based not at all good to visit again"
"the restaurant did not send cutlery. In spite of requesting for cutlery in cooking instructions, there was not cutlery sent. how do you expect us to procure 2-3 nos of cutlery from market?"
""
"the cake was all dried up. Tiramisu was hard, not melting at all, as shown in image on the web page."
""
extremely horrible cheesecakes. I had ordered a blueberry and chocolate truffle cheesecake. IT IS EXTREMELY DISGUSTING. THEY ARE SERVING OLD STALE FOOD . IT ALSO HAD HAIR IN IT . PLEASE DO NO BUY FROM HERE IF U WANT TO GET SICK
""
Salad low quality not like before. Add on Cheese like nothing. Vegetables not so fresh. Im disappoint for this time
