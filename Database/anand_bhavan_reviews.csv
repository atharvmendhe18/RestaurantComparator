Review
Matunga had umpteen options for South Indian food and all may be good one way or other but Anand Bhavan is by far the best option to go to. No extra showbazi 😁. No nonsense. Clean hygienic affordable and the tastiest food U can have. The Tuppa Dosa. Idlis ( the biggest in size in all matunga ) they have some different bhaji concept everyday n I have tried the Chana Masala which Is yum as well. Lastly the beet root halwa.
Delicious food and customer friendly service makes this place a treat for authentic south indian cuisine lovers.
Had a pathetic experience the manager and staff was very very rude. Won't even give half star if that was option..place is vrry small and conjusted tables. The taste of Sambhar ws very bad. Never coming back here for sure
"We visited this place on a Sunday and the waiting was for 15-20 mins. It is a very simple place with no fancy ambience. Being there on a Sunday, the place was crowded and thus the service was slow and most of their special items were over by 8 pm. We could only order their normal items like pineapple sheera (this only has pineapple essence and no real fruit but tastes good), filter coffee (must have), mysore sada and mysore masala dosa, vada rasam, idli sambar and onion rava dosa.

"Looks a small place but the quality of food is well maintained. It was our first visit here, we ordered Dahi bhaat and masala set dosa both were superb. Along with filter coffee. Lovely place for quick lunch and pocketfriendly as well. Must try place. Wish to visit again. 😊👌"
Third class sub standard in short! Zero in presentation and efforts. Just walk across to cafe Madras for a more fulfilling and gratifying experience.
"Good to drop sometimes just for a snack or maybe a light meal, the vada sambhar are worth it and so is the coffee."
"Great place to visit specially for breakfast. My family and I come here every Saturday all the way from Andheri. Owner of the restaurant is really friendly. What I love here is prompt service and delicious south Indian food. They also have a range of desserts to choose from. Totally recommended. My favourite is bun puri, it brings my memories back from Mangalore. 😊"
We have been customers for last 40 years. And over past few years the quality of the food has been going down. Yesterday most of the food was disappointing. Mysore sada dosa was like papad. Dry and the chutney inside had no taste. The ulundu dosa was not crisp and porous. It was sticky inside. Also the coffee was barely warm. The batata vada was the only edible item.
"Sambhar from this place of better than Ramashray, loved having idlivada plate here. The filter coffee seemed on par, maybe you might need to add sugar seperately. They've nowadays started serving it papercups sadly, demand for a traditional metal cup and they'll give. Pineapple sheera could have been better, was little on the sweeter side, lacking authentic taste & also pineapple peices"
"This is one of my favourite places for Sunday Breakfast. The food served here is always hot and fresh. Though this place is only offering takeaway and delivery, the food is always good. I had recently ordered some Idlis and Vadas from here. They were very neatly packed and the food was served with fresh coconut chutney and hot Sambhar"

"If you are in Kings Circle(Hub for South Indian Food), this is the place that is a must visit . Have been eating here since we were kids , and now we ourselves have kids !! Many places have opened and shut here in Matunga and its vicinity , but only the best survive. They did not have a physical copy of their menu card in my childhood days , and not much has changed even today. Their special items deserve a try.Quality has been consistently maintained over the years.No complaints as regards hygiene.A simple decor , good service. The family section is separate(UPSTAIRS) and there are sharing tables below.Its always a good place to visit for authentic south Indian Food that does not burn a...read more"
"Anand Bhavan serves THE best south indian food.. Be it sambar , the chutney , dosa , idli , vada , sabji n what not ...... If u are a fan of south indian food u can not afford to miss this place at all"

"May it be a quick snack, a heavy breakfast or a stomach-filling lunch/ dinner, South Indian Food is the best! This place is an old gem situated in Matunga. For many students, it is their adda. And why not! The place serves amazing South Indian food. From Sada Dosa to Mysore Masala, from Idli Vada to the delicious Pineapple Sheera- this place serves everything at very pocket-friendly rates starting at just 50rs. Well not to forget the highlight of this place is also their filtered coffee. After a long night out, this place will serve your hunger even at 5 am. A must visit and a perfect 5/5!"
"Anand Bhavan has been our go to Saturday morning breakfast place for the last couple of years. The fact that it is right at the circle definitely makes it more accessible. In general, I think the food here is one of the best when compared to other restaurants serving South Indian cuisine in the area (and there are plenty of them).Things you should definitely try here:The bun puri- its a sweetish puri with a little bit of coconut. Tastes quite good with the chutney. You are likely to get them hot and fresh early in the morning or around 4.30 - 5pm.The filter coffee, if you ask the server to make it strong.If you want to try something sweet, the pineapple sheera here is one of their most...read more"

"I recently went there with a friend who wanted to have south Indian coffee. While we were still having the coffee, the waiter came with the bill, my friend said that he's hungry and asked the waiter to get a dosa followed by tea. The waiter went back to the owner and came back to say that it's not available, while we could see the person at the next table was still eating the same. Then the owner came to tell that we can have the tea standing outside, while the people in line are given the table. Being a female, I politely asked the owner when we went to pay, that what's the issue and he rudely replied that we'll have to stand out for the next table. We paid and left.
Honestly the food...read more"
Food was okay but ambience was worse. Won't recommend for south indian cuisine especially in Matunga. Better options are available in this cuisine nearby.

"Best South Indian recipes of Mumbai, with the taste, aroma and healthy food, for mind, body and soul."

"It is the worst place ever. The owners feel they are giving food for free. Especially the owners son is the most rude guy ever. He has no manners to talk to senior citizens as well. Chutney is stale. Dosa is too oily
Sambhar is sour. Matunga is filled vd south indian places, a person in the right frame of mind shouldnt go here. I have had a bad experience at the restaurant."

Anand bhavan is located at matunga east . Mumbai . The ambience of the restaurant is also good and staff and food too . And that too at affordable prices .
"Anand Bhavan is an institution and has been for a very long time. Needless to say that their food and ambience reflects an old world vibe. The food is really wholesome prepared fresh. Had been here on a Sunday and there always is line. Had the masala dosa, ulundu dosa and filter coffee. The masala was yum, ulundu dosa is basically an utappam topped with a dry masala and ghee. Filter coffee too was strong and fragrant"
Yum
"Average food
I personally love South Indian cuisine but the food here has disappointed me.
It is a very well known and old restaurant located in Matunga junction.
Sheera just melts in your mouth.
Dal Wada sucked .
Idli sambar average."
They should accept cards or app payments
"Great place for South Indian food in Matunga! It's just opposite to the station and it's a normal place with good seating. The menu is very limited here and the taste is good but compared to other similar restuarants in the same area this place is not very much recommended! The dosa, pulao and coffee tasted good and the service by the staff was a bit of an issue"

"Another place which is always crowded.  Dont miss their Filter coffee
, Rasam Vada, Rava Dosa as well as Neer dosa with coconut chutneys."

"These delicious, authentic South Indian dishes from Anand Bhavan, Matunga @abmatunga that we ate over the weekend in Mumbai 😋

We equally love all the south indian places in Matunga. So we keep going on rotation basis (also on the basis of crowd and waiting time😛) We ate the following dishes 👇

Mysore rawa sada dosa : perfect texture, crispy with the absolutely delicious Mysore masala in it😋

Mangalore buns: these are one of the best buns I have had till now. These are sweetish thick kinda puris made from flour, banana, buttermilk and cumin

Biscoot roti: this is the Mangalorean version of a kachori, only difference is it has a savoury stuffing made of coconut with a basic...read more"
Always a good idea to visit this place for authentic south Indian food. Would definitely recommend the masala dosa and buns and not to forget the filter coffee.
It does not accept credit cards

"This review isn’t about their food. But, you wouldn’t want to be fed good food along with being letched at constantly. First of all I’m welcomed by an arrogant manager who stops me and tells me to wait while he checks if there’s a table empty for me whereas the place was empty at that time sparing a table which was occupied by a family. Misbehaving attendant who gets wrong food to my table and doesn’t even apologise only to surprise me again by leaning on my table while I eat. He even tried to touch me while placing my food on the table! The most disappointing experience was when the manager acts ignorant when I share my feedback with him and only nods. He didn’t even bother...read more"
"A really good authentic South Indian joint. You will definitely get a nostalgic feeling while entering. The waft of fresh idlis and dosas is so refreshing as you walk in, and the shelves of banana chips and murukku are so nice to see.

We ordered many dishes like Rasam Vada, Special Dosa, Idli Mulgapodi and all of them were superb. The rasam was nice and spicy, the dosa full of flavour and the idlis were so soft and delicate they almost melted in one's mouth! Finished it off with fresh coffee (it was my first time trying) and I absolutely loved it.

Ambience is great, and service was fast. Friendly servers as well. Overall an amazing experience and a must-try. Tick's off one item on the...read more"
"Today you have broken your own records in a way
I had softest and Best Vada Sambhar so far

Thank you Preetesh and Haridasji

Good Food Good Hospitality"
"Great place to be for south Indian food. you must try delicious Rava sada dosa, Idli chutney with rasam .Service is fast and cost effective."
"One of the best south indian Restro in Matunga/king circle.. this is my fav place .. the interior is good.. even the waiters are polite but one negative thing is you have to wait outside restro in a queue ... Rest everything is perfect.
overall -4/5"
A place located at king circle where you can fulfil your cravings for South Indian food. Medu wada and filter coffee a perfect combo also dosa's are good♥
"So this is a simple South Indian outlet in Matunga. We tried different type of Dosas and all of them were good.
Even Idli vada was good. Since this is more of just break fast place you can't expect much. But still worth a try."
"A nice place to much on for light breakfast or lunch simple food no luxurious servicing or food. Good enough for urgent visits not as a get together though, based on price the food is a little expensive but it's a very crowded location for the people living around since the food is very tasty and ample of quantity"
South indian traditional options are available ..tried idli wrapped in a leaf was ok..mysore sada was ok and coffee was ok as well ..not so great as the neighbours 😁
"A typical #SouthIndian feasting mood is on with authenticity on a plate!💛

In frame:
•Stuff Rawa Biscuit Dosa
•Rasam-Idli
•Mysore Sada Dosa
•Tawa Pulao with Papad & Raita

And all dishes were accompanied with Sambhar & Coconut Chutney."
"Another South Indian restaurant at Matunga Circle.

Not like the others in quality and authenticity, but still alright.

We tried their,
1) Neer Dosa (light and fluffy)
2) Filter Coffee (strong and tasty)

Ambience is simple, but could be cleaner. Service is fast and rates are reasonable.

The menu is displayed on the wall for you to choose.

They have, both the ground and first floors for seating."
Matunga’s the hub for South Indian Food paradise. Every 2nd restaurant competes with each other on which place serves the best South Indian Meal. Would suggest do not compare Just enjoy their specialities
"Matunga feels like a hub for South Indian food hub to me and which is true for Anand Bhavan.

Visited the restaurant for Lunch, the place was decently crowded. They have 7-8 tables on the ground floor and more sitting upstairs.
The service was good and quick.

Ordered -
1) Filter coffee
It's a must try, the coffee was really strong and perfect in taste. A must have after meal

2) Idli Sambhar
3) Vada Rasam
4) Rava Masala Dosa

5) Neer Dosa
served with sweet coconut chutney

I personally found the above items really not upto the mark, the taste was just ordinary and I believe it could have been better. I have had really good South Indian that's why found this restaurant to be a big...read more"
"I usually stop by Anand Bhavan every now and then to pack some mouth watering medu vadas. The pineapple sheera and filter coffee is amazing. We also regularly order from this place, the have quick service and are very professional."
"This place is one of the best by far for some good simple authentic South Indian food.One thing i found good is they provide good quality and quantity in food which makes it totally worth!!
I tried out some of their speciality

Khotto idli (5/5) : These idlis are made in jackfruit leaves and which is why they have a different nice smell and taste from those leaves.It was served with red coconut chutney and sambhar. It is not like regular idlis these are not fluffy but tastes better with sambhar.

Veg Thali (5/5) : Though it may look simple and not fancy but thats the beauty of these south indian food. Eventhough the French beans sabji might looked just boiled but it was not.It was well...read more"

Another Great place for South Indian cuisines. This place serves the best chutney and Sambhar. Good diverse menu. It's a place worth for a shot
"When Sunday lunch is at the place where you spent all your teenage years! 😍This is not a review but my sheer love for this place! ❤️ Places are set up and closed at Matunga every now and then. This place has not changed even a but, nor in taste nor interiors. As they say, simplicity is the best form of elegance! 💕"
Ordered Upma Podi from here. The upma was very delicious and yum. Chutney was good to taste. The powder on upma is a bit salty and reminds u of vada pav chutney but i loved it
My all time favourite for weekend breakfast. Even the staff knows me well now :). My favourite food over here is EVERYTHING :D. Ask for Sukka (Dry) chatni whatever dish you order.
I like this hotel coz it has Appam in menu... Whereas i find it nower else... But they shud provide brown chana curry wid appam or stew... Instead of chutney n sambhar... I nver got dumplings in menu available... Please consider the both ... Thn u r the best 😊
"We have travelled to Anand Bhavan since the last 20 yrs, because they make the most authentic idli and sambar in mumbai. Last week we were delighted to know that they had also started thalis. The thali was really good with huge portions that one person can barely finish.At Rs.110/- its the best deal around.I would have rated it 5* except for the shared seating system........otherwise its a must try."
"Apart from the Strawberry Bizcocho, the other desserts are ok. The chocolate cake that I had ordered was hard and stale. We had also ordered a cappuccino and the after eight mint drink and the server let it sit for a good five minutes at the counter before he brought it to our table. He did offer to re heat it for us."
"Located at the heart of kings circle, just opposite to garden this is the place which is my favourite from my childhood! Famous for its south Indian food.
Less of queue and good food.
Must visit once"
"Typical south indian food lovers place...!!

On a sunday evening thought of having south indian food, as i was near Matunga it always reminds me about Ramashray, Ayappam or Anand bhawan the best three places in Matunga to have south indian food. As it was a sunday evening both the places Ramshray and Ayappam had waiting of half and hour so thought of Anand bhawan where we got to seat in 20 mins.

Ambience here is very basic yet people love to come here and have their food. Waiter here have full knowledge about their special dishes and on their recommendation we ordered the following dishes

"Sunday morning breakfast South Indian special!!!
Matunga is a hub for authentic south indian food and this place has got it absolutely right!
We tried several dishes ranging from varieties of dosas made with different diffrent pulses and dals, dahi misal pav , some sweet dishes like phirni( just okay) and rabri and ended it with a super filter coffee
This place offers a variety of South Indian dishes at affordable price and their chutneys both coconut and red one are very good."
"The gold standards for a South Indian breakfast remains Cafe Madras. The desire to eat pipping hot idlis manifested one Saturday morning, unfortunately without the accompanying desire to trundle ourselves to Matunga and patiently wait our turn! We decided to order in from Anand Bhavan ( the only place open early enough and willing to deliver).

Decent idlis though not as fluffy. The ulundu dosa made of urad dal was not a patch on the Madras cafe one and the wadas were serviceable. The Podi was the biggest letdown being dominated by chillies versus other flavourings. Avoidable pineapple sheera. All in all a decent breakfast but clearly a Matunga trip to Madras cafe is at another level."
"Simple and Homely.The typical south indian khana with ghee..Absolutely yumm!
The idlis, wadas, dosas are made to satiate your cravings.The packet food items are great too."
"That the best place to have South Indian in Matunga it's each and every dishes are binge worthy
Starting with:

1. Uthappa: It's my personal favorite whenever I visit this place I make sure I order this plate its so soft and super delicious you will definitely like this😋

2. Idli vada: That never goes out of my list the sambar is just amazing which tastes amazing with it's super sponge idli and crispy vada 🤩

3. Pineapple Sheera: My meal never gets complete with my favorite desi Desi dessert it tastes amazing when it served hot

4. Phirni: After having spicy amazing dishes this is highly highly ⚠️⚠️⚠️RECOMMENDED 😋 it's serviced chill and, it's super delicious

"Being a man from Matunga, this restaurant too has been my all time favourite. It’s located slightly inside the main Matunga Road from Kings Circle, and this is my favorite too. The restaurant is owned by the original South Indian residents of Matunga residing since generations.

This place is famous for its South Indian dishes like the Dosas, Idlis, Medu Vadas and other dishes. Their Upma is the beat I’ve ever had and I frequent this restaurant for this particular item. Their Uttapams are top notch. Flavour of their chutney and Sambar are distinct too and leave taste in your mouth.

This place too hasn’t changed in years and they have the typical feel of an old time South Indian...read more"
"This was the only space left to be tried amongst the famous trio south indian restaurants in Matunga East.

To be honest, this didn't meet my expectations at all. I started out with Appam and Veg stew of which the stew was too unexciting. Appam felt just okay.

Went with the Rasam vada next, again the expectation levels were sky high. The rasam was too sweetish and never complemented my taste buds.

That's how I concluded my fooding and thus decided to visit a nearby restro for completing the breakfast."
Matunga east is very popular for its aunthentic south Indian restaurant and cuisine. And Anand Bhavan is one of the charming restaurant in matunga east. I have tried their idli vada and believe me I have never Aten such an idli which just melts in your mouth and the vada was so so good . This restaurant is serving from around 1940 and it would not be wrong to say that it is one of the finest south Indian food serving restaurant in matunga east. Would surely recommend this.
"Matunga is quite famous for its very own authentic South Indian cuisines....
They have curated the flavours very well....
This restaurant is not exception...
The atmosphere here is crowdy ....a typical old restaurant...Nothing wow in ambience ..
But the Food is main USP...
They also serve authentic podi also famous as gun powder 😋, fried papad , chips etc.
You need to wait at least 15-30 min on routine day...the waiting time is more on holidays...
My most favourite dish is Bisibilli Bhat ( Consistency of Dal Khichdi ) a must try here
Don't forget to end your meal with Filter Kapi 😋
A healthy meal indeed. ...
Indulge with Podi ,. Chips at their counter and don't forget to take it...read more"
This is nice old budget south indian cafe. Their service is prompt but not compromising in food quality. You will find ruckus happening around you because of so many people eating here. This place is very budget friendly
"Just one of the South Indian hotels in Matunga but not as good as its peers, old restaurant and the interiors also justify the same.
I ordered :
1 Idli Vada Sambhar : Idli was soft , Sambhar was pretty decent , Vada was a bit hard and felt Oily, Chutney was decent in taste but didn't seem fresh.
2 Dal Vada : This was pretty good, nice mix of onions & Dal , not spicy at all. Would recommend it.
The service is good but a bit slow, the captain offered to refill my Sambhar which I whole heartedly obliged to as the Sambhar was tasty and helped me in curing my sore throat."
I have been visiting Anand Bhavan over the years. The have the best filter coffee (medium strong) in Matunga. Their special masala dosa and special ulundu are great. The restaurant is light on your tummy and pocket too. It's in evidently one of the jewels of Matunga.
It was 5 star experience because of simple Ambiance and Amazing food taste with high quality. It was worth it. Food prices are quite reasonable with the level of quality. Service were very quick and Filtet Kaapi & Bisi bele rise were mind blowing.
"I totally agree with Angelina, food quality is also very bad and also the owner is very arrogant and abusive when complained about the poor quality.Do not go to this place even by mistake."
