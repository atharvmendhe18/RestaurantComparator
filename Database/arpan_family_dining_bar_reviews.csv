Review
"Ordered paneer kadhai and naan yesterday.
The taste was good.
The naan was a bit uncooked...
Overall loved the food and had great experience🤗"
Have been there many a times.Everytime the experience was good...had ordered chicken punjabi and chicken biryani..both were up to the mark.This place is best when you go out with family..truly a wonderful place👍👌
"Silly expensive.
Not worthy, not good ambience, food quality and quantity is below average. Not for family as #InDecent #Crowd
#NotForFoodie"
"Have ordered from this place for office punches and the quality of starters is usually very good only problem was there delivery time have tried chilly chicken , butter chicken and chicken tikka from this place go for punjabi dishes if you visit this place ambience is nice and its suitable for families"
"This restaurant is exactly near Vikhroli station and close to few corporate offices around. The Menu of this restaurant is similar to all the other Family and Bar Restaurants. We regularly visit this place because food is good and services they provide are quite decent. I have tried lot of varieties here. The best ones I can suggest are Chicken Amritsari, Veg Biryani, Dal Tadka and Jeera rice, Sweet Lime Soda, Chicken Zarina and Veg Manchurian."
"Awesome food, chicken amritsari was sumptuous.
Need to work on the ambience. Overall average place for a casaul dining. Seating could have been better !"
I ordered veg Kolhapuri which was not as spicy as it should be but good taste not bad.
"Awesome dal. But can't bear the floating oil. Even after specially mentioning in the preparation instructions, dal came with oil floating on surface. Roti was also not warm enough to eat."
taste of veg patiala was very tasty.....😋😋😋....will suggest friends to order from here
ordered tawa paneer and cheese methi tikkas. both were good. they should provide green chutney for starters
Prices are bit high but taste wise place is good for dinner .I had murg musalam which was good but dal khichdi was delicious small and cosy place to dine at.
"Food was not tasty at all, very bland and not worth the price paid"
"Have ordered from here multiple times... If you give special instructions to not make food spicy at all, then it is edible else you will not be able to eat it. And priced ona highly considering it is a Dinning Bar"
So since I have visited most of the grand restaurants but to be true never come across this taste with the reasonable amount. The service is good. What I like about Arpan Bar is they have evolved in taste in a good way. Wherever I want to order a fine dine food I just call here and yes need to mention they communicate very well n listen calmly and also advises according to the wants for the taste.. So from Firangi Pani to Tap and many more to visit I will never stop ordering the tasty food from my all time favourite restaurant and yes my childhood memories are attached too! Kudos and keep growing!
Pathetic Service. Quantity of food is very low and prices are high. Quality is okay but service is pathetic. Have to wait for 20-25 minutes for order whereas Bill was given to us within 2 minutes.
"Chicken biryani and chicken dum biryani Both had a superb taste
Even chicken Tandoori was delicious
The only thing I would mention is the order was served quite but still
Do visit once if you are hanging out near vikhroli station ✌✌"
"Ordered home delivery from here. We ordered spring rolls, manchurian, paneer tikka masala and paneer biryani.
Spring rolls were tasty but a bit salty and moreover they must have packed very hot ones as they were completely soggy when we got it.
Manchurian was very very salty. We could literally taste salt crystals while eating manchurian.
Paneer tikka masala was ok ok but very garlicky. It was their recommended dish but we were not very happy with taste.
Paneer biryani was high on vanaspati ghee but was very yummy and can definitely be tried again.

Overall if they do little improvements in their food, they can go long way."
"Food and service was excellent however they screwed up when comes to care. I was there as it was raining. My fiance requested if they can charge the phone. After paying the bill, we asked for the phone, they gave back with a broken screen. And no one wants to take the responsibility. We didn't want to penalise, we wanted them to admit it that it was their fault. Our first happy rainy evening at Arpan was spoilt because of their behaviour."
"A sophisticated bar with beautiful ambience..very silent music and best place to go for a date or just to meet-n-talk.
Food is fabulous and well priced. Drinks are over-priced but ambience makes it worth."
Good and decent place for Booze and NV food. Restaurant is small so almost every Friday it's full. Service is fast. They have decent vegetarian food as well.
Service is excellent. Section steward verry carefully take the table. Keep it up. Fast service fast food. Veg moncho soup awesome. And complement cheesling wonderful. So nice😁😁😁sunil service great 😃
Very delicious food.But dishes are costly. Ordered Chicken Tandoori Lollipop ...only available in this restaurant in Vikhroli.  .Would like to visit the place again
"This is one of my fav places to booze with office frndz... to mention - there is very goodservice, they have good non veg food especially the main course is good. Space is a bit small so if it is crowded they can ull be into a buzzing. However,  can njoy the booze and food with friends. Good to take female friends as the crowd is very decent."
"Loved it here once! Came back for a second..
Great food.. awesime time

"A Friday Evening and we Landed here as it was close from Vikhroli Station . A Typical Bar with good lights and decent Crowd .

Food : For Starters we ordered Chicken Chilly , Chicken Crispy , Prawns Tawa Fry - All were pretty decent but less in Quantity . Further Chicken Platter ( 5 types of Starters ) with good Quantity and taste . The kebabs were well prepared . Dal Khichdi was pretty good as well . Chicken schezwan rice was just not good . Bad in taste and Quality . The cost for Liquior is also fine , just like normal Bar rates .

If you just want starters and Liquior - its a good place but many options alongside this place fo Weekend Chill ."

"We wanted to go to shashi punjab which is just beside this one, but as it was Friday night and all places was full we luckily got one table at this place. Service is good and fast, food is yummy. We ordered chicken tikka and chicken crispy and some other dishes with drinks. It was nice experience, and we lost track of time in drinking and talking that when we saw the entrance, shutter was half closed down. But they didn't said anything and then we left at 1:15. Overall nice dining place."
A little reasonable restaurant. Good quality foood. Had ordered chicken afghani kebab. It was yummy good chicken portions soft n juicy. Only the service is a bit slow.
Tasty food... Quick service... N value for money... Would recommend to my friends for sure...mouth melting kebabs...n mocktail which was made in the absence of bartender was great...
The service was pleasant and food too was good....for a descent family restro and bar the rates were reasonable.... You can go with a group of friends or with your family for a dinner....will be there soon
Now this was a pleasurable experience. Had some really good food. This place delivers also quite promptly and is a fun place to visit either with your family or friends.
Not so good!!! Naan are just like Roti's. All veg main course like paneer Items and baby corn items are almost same looks and same taste!!!!
"I'm amazed at the number of fine dining bars (or so called) have propped up in central and eastern suburbs in the past decade or so, this is an indicator that the economy has boomed in the past couple of decades, in addition to the easy access to plastic money and loans. However, I'd quickly want to get away from the debate of a booming economy to doing what I came online for! Although the name here does not mention, when you visit the place the banner says ""A fine dining experience"". You enter the place and the first question you ask yourself is, does the owner understand the meaning of Fine Dining Experience, or was it something that he/she had intended this place to be and it went...read more"
"This is one of our frequently visited place to rebound some horrible movie experience @ Huma Adlabs.

It is one of the many restaurants flocking Vikhroli station. The alley opposite the main entrance is dug up 365 days a year. So you might not notice Arpan in first place, but once you are in you won't regret your decision.

Our regulars at this place are - Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Monchow soup, few drinks and loads of chakna.

We visit this place almost every weekend but haven't tried their main course yet.

Some virgin dishes tried over the months are -

1. CCP sticks - Cheese + Cherry + Pineapple
They were good, Pines n Cherries are fresh and held up together immaculately.

2. Lung...read more"

"Good ambience

Must try: Ask for the sprouts special for starters. You will be happily amazed at this tasty health dish."
"I love the sprouts of this hotel.....
Highly recommended...
food is just awsum...."
I was pleasantly surprised with this gem of a restaurant in a busy street near Vikhroli (W) Station. Excellent Staff. Lovely Food. Extremely reasonably priced. Highly recommend.
One of my favorite restuarants in vikhroli small and has a pretty quite bar.
"Good food. I ordered Daal Tadka, Jeera rice, roti and paneer bhurji. Daal Tadka was good and it had very good quantity. Jeera rice was also good but quantity was pathetic. Paneer bhurji was OK.
If you are working late & if your office is around vikhroli, then you can go for this one."
Awesome food with good quality of spices and oil... Best in Vikhroli :)
"food

Food is amazing and well priced. The staff is courteous and friendly. Loved the kebabs.
