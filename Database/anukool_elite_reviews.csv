Review
I walked in to this restaurant. And ordered Misal paav which was awesome. The quality and quantity was great. Every thing was fresh. loved this place.
Totaly stale food was brought up to door panner masala was smelling bad and manchutian rice was also not in a state of eating the whole food bill went up to 371 and it was totally waste i would prefer to buy food from any other restro than this
They dont know how to deal with customers..called them for delivery purpose tge guy on the phone was rude...i guess they should have taken hospitality classes first den they should have started this business.
"Being a non Veg person,  usually never order from veg restaurants. But By chance I came across this Restaurant, and its really a good option for veg lovers. Tomato shorba, Paneer Bhurji, veg chilly all were wonderful. Punjabi Thali also a pretty good option. One of favorites was the dal Khichadi, which I order regularly, which is the perfect simple dish, and when you compare it with other restaurants thier dal khichadi stands out."
Food quality is good.Taste is nice .. try veg bbq starter.. service is good. A nice restaurant for all the vegetarians out there on Dombivli
"Food quality taste is awesome. Management is also good and the staff members are very cooperative and helpful. In short best restaurant to visit in Dombivali in terms of food, services, prices are also in budget ."
I went there on rakshabandhan the service was very impressive and food quality was also awesome i like the most thing over there was chinese food.....maintain it keep going...thankyou..
"Haven't been to this place as yet but yeah, through someone, got a parcel of 'upma' delivered to my place. I really loved the taste of upma and would like to check-out other food especially the South Indian variety from this place. I will definitely visit this place and I am told this place is located near the Dombivali Railway Station. I am always eager to try-out the South Indian and Maharashtrian foods of Dombivali East. With no facilities of a back-end kitchen to support my kitchen needs, all my meals out here are either office cafetaria, eating-out or parcel. And guess what? Its a really adventurous food-journey and I am enjoying it too much. Nearly every day, I think what to try...read more"
"I went here wd my mom,had anukool special dosa...worth 130...it was value for money..i liked there food so much so that every saturday i order sumthng frm this hotel..it has very tasty,perfect combination of spice n sweet food...for foodies..its a must visit hotel..."
Wide variety in the menu. Taste is decent but not extraordinary. Very near to railway station which makes it good for those days when you are in mood for a quick dinner without much travel. Rice items need to improve though.
Very bed experience i ever had since the hotel is established I am visiting there but each & every time i got bed experience the waiter's are behaving like k they are the owner of d hotel food quality is average & if we ask something to the waiter's so they don't give satisfactory reply & if we argue with them so they also ready for it so it's very good royalty for hotel & if we complaint to the hotel manager about inconvenience so he is giving reply k hamare idhar toh aesa hi system h & when i am hearing d above line i jzt want to say please respect d customer at least yaar otherwise no one like ur hotel at d my side i am never again visiting at ur hotel....& one thing now the new rule...read more
"Good food with great location.. Just opposite to dombivli station this restro provide good south indian food.. Though being a small restro ambience is not as much of family restaurant.. But for people having hectic living :P
Recommend to try uttappas if you been near dombivli station.
Value for money 4/5
Food 4/5
Ambience and hygiene 3/5
Location 4.5/5"
Very Good hotel..nice ambience in ac section although service bit slow..located close to station....recommended.- paneer achari and mushroom Manchurian !
"Food is nice, ambience is also very good. Good service as well. Very reasonable. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Will definitely recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends."
"after a long time in dombivli we have got a good restaurant with good taste. After the other famous hotel in dombivli, I would say this restaurant would beat other restaurants food, quality, quantity and price.I been there once, and was really happy to taste the food. A/c Section ambience is good. though little congested way to reach A/c, but considering the place which they have got, managed quite well. also home delivery we didn't face any issues on taste and received good quantity. would recommend to all Dombivlikar's and other people to visit once."
"Note [DONT ORDER FOOD OVER HERE THEY R TOO RUDE FOR HOME DELIVERY SERVICE]
NICE RESTAURANT WITH TASTE OF HOME FOOD. IF UR ROAMING NEAR DOMBIVLI STATION THIS RESTO IS GOOD OPTION FOR UR HUNGRY STOMACH.
AMBIENCE 4/5
FOOD 3.5/5 NEED TO IMPROVE
LOCATION 5/5
STAFF 3/5"
Had expectations and lived up to the mark great food quality the quantity was also nice unlike other places in dombivili the food was unique service was wonderful also .A must try
"Entered the place with a expectations to have usual Punjabi food for dinner which we generally end up having in most of the restaurants (different names but same gravy )... But food was definitely better as compared to any other restaurants in Dombivali with perfect amount of spices.

Quality and quantity of food - 4/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 3/5

It's bang opposite to railway station so parking is an issue.
Place is bit crowded too. Reserve your table in advance."
"Dombivli is starting to adapt modern cuisine and anukul elite is one good example for that
Air-conditioned tables with slow Bollywood music are nice ambience
Service could have been better need a little improvement
Food is good to taste...both quality and quantity wise
Paneer chilly is spicy hot combination
Manchurian gravy is tasty but little thin
Rice quantity is good for empty stomach
If you want a quick bite...try pav bhaji
Taste is okeish...have big chunks of tomatoes and served with papad...now I have no idea what papad is doing with pav bhaji...does not make sense to me."
worst place i ever visitedd..especially the staff though in ac section it was just ridiculousss.. I expected sum gud thng while entering but wen i entered the staff were talking sum cheap aspect i tought looking at guest tey wuld stop but nooo tey continuedd.. Worsttt..worsttt..
"This place is one of the best veg treats which has opened recently. The quality of food, service is exceptional. Ambience is pretty good too.
Recommended for authentic veg cuisines specially mushroom manchurian and mutka dum biryani."
"Such a find in the bylanes of Dombivli. After a long and tiring day, I was too lazy to travel for food so we decided to have a quick lunch here. And I'm so glad we did.
We started with Achari Paneer Tikka and Mushroom Munchurian. This has got to be the tastiest paneer I've tasted. Cooked to perfection with the right amount of spice. A delight to the tastebuds and the appetite.
Next up was the Mushroom Munchurian. I've never tried this dish anywhere before and I feel like I missed out on so much. What a change from the usual munchurian dishes. The mushrooms blended so well with the munchurian spice. It was easily the best starter.
This place is a delight to authentic Indian food so we...read more"
Food is delicious and service is also gud and prompt ....must go place...ambience is also very goodd .........chinese cuisine is goood ....
Taste is good. Quantity and quality of food is also good. Service has a lot of scope for improvement. Hotel staff is not well trained. Ambience is avg. Need to maintain cleanliness. They have to take advantage of the place and the prime area where it is located. Good for snacks. Avg for maincourse.
Delicious veg food. Very good ambience. Well located and quick serviceüëçüèª Great for on the go food will surely go back again. Do try the Special matka Dum Biryani..
