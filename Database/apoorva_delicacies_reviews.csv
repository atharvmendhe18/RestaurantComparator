"Cheap place, with arrogant staff we waited 30 minutes for A/c"

"Dahi vada was good but paneer tawa pulao was average. The paneer tawa pulao had an abundance of veggies, but unfortunately, the paneer portion was noticeably lacking. It would be great if the balance between veggies and paneer could be improved for a more satisfying experience."
"very less chutney provided
we ordered 3 items and chutney was provided only for 2 items"

"They didnâ€™t close the lids of the gravy. One of it was spilled and other one was loose. Horrible service, didnâ€™t even bother to pack it properly.
First I blamed the delivery agent but it wasnâ€™t his fault. The restaurant didnâ€™t close it."
All the dishes were tasteless.Did not like even one dish
