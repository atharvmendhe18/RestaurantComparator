Review
"New Aamantran is the best for the tandoor lovers!
Be it Chicken, fish or simply mushrooms. Tried almost everything here and still Tandoori fish(basa), tandoori prawns and chicken tandoori(ofcourse! How can I miss it) tops on my list. Also, tried chicken triple schezwan fried rice which was more than enough for two. Good food, good quality and quantity and also pocket friendly. It is little compacted but still spacious enough for you to sit comfortably and eat. Do visit with your family and friends and do let me know your experience!

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambience: 3.5/5"
"Today afternoon i had a vist to this restaurant in search of good lunch, my previous experience had a quite nice experience but now the things have changed here. The staff doesn't even bother to offer you a cup of water in this hot weather. Even after you ask it they wont bother to give l. For futher they don't bother to serve the food and don't ask for side dishes they will give after you foods completed. For others don't waste your valuable time and money to come here and waste time."
"Ordered chicken tandoori from zomato and get in 143/-
Food quality was awesome
Quantity also awesome fresh chicken
Gives 5 out 5 stars for this resto."
Good Taste and quantity
"Have visited this place thousand times during my college days. 

I would recommend chicken maggi and idli chilli. coz we used to enjoy these dishes quite often.

Thank you :)"
"Food is good must try chicken lollypop ,chicken crispy and chicken biryani .Ambience and staff is good friendly service. Nice place to hangout with friends"
We had ordered 1combination rice which seemed like normal fried rice with no sauces provided appropriately and the quantity was also less..waste of money.
"Visited this restaurant

Best food quality & a complete family restaurant

"This place is very famous for its chicken handi and butter chicken. It‚Äôs finger licking good to be very honest. If you want nice authentic food, do try out Aamantran!"
Really nice restaurant in Kandivali east. Went there today and it's getting revamped right now. The Ambience is now changing and getting much better. Do go here!! Cheers!!

Really tasty paw bhaji and tawa pulao. Great place to order from in Thakur village. Very very tasty food. Delivery is always on time. Must try.
Delicious food and the ambience one is very comfortable! Very inexpensive and quality food! Non - vegetarian food is finger licking! Starters are great!
Really good food at Amantran.. have been ordering for a long time now. Great paneer ki sabse and dal makhani. Amazing delivery as well. Great experience
"I have been going to this place with family for an while. Finally thought of reviewing it, as its been a place we go for all occasions. Their food is always a thumps up and service it very friendly which pairs up together well. Only one thing was below average was the ambience but i am glad finally they are renovating it and promised to upgrade their menus as well with few more items. Eagerly waiting to take my friends and family."
Excellent food!!!.. Good service. Is hygienic and great place for a group dining. Must visit as one of the best hotels in the town with great variety of food.
"Looking for some great food?
The New Aamantran is your stop.
amazing food and amazing staff,the place is clean and fresh. It is a place i would recommend everyone to visit.
food-8/10
service-8/10"
bad food.. this kind of food I can not expect from restaurant...
pathetic food not worth single rupee wasted my money and time
"Excellent taste in Chinese food and Tandoor. Idli Chilly fry is a must. Serves all day up until midnight , this joint offers a variety of items with a blast of taste in the mouth. The best thing, they don't charge extra for fried noodles. :D Its rare to find a restaurant that serves Indian food and Chinese both so tasteful at the same time. Speedy delivery and very co-operative owner makes this joint a classic in Thakur Village. Not to forget to mention that it's been around for more than 15 years."
no quantity
"Had chicken tandoori biryani. Super tasty and Also try prawns Tikka, just awesome. Liked there taste better than other thakur village restaurant...value for mone"
Veg Chilly Milly was a bit spicy..should have been less spicy..schezwan rice n tandoori roti was good
great
"I ordered Butter chicken full and 10 tawa rotis.

Butter chicken was not up to the usual taste you find in other restaurants. the quantity was not good either. I could have got double the quantity of ordered from somewhere else. so overall a bad experience."
i ordered chicken kolhapuri they delivered some different dishe
Quantity is so less. don't give discount if you can't afford it.
it was spicy..so needs to be less spicy..
"I normally order tandoori chicken from this resturant because I like their preparation
but what got delivered today was small 7 piece of chicken may be from left over chicken handi fully soaked in oil and very spicy.If you had no material left you would have cancelled the order rather than sending crap"
good
good food!
"Could have been better, need more improvement, butter chicken was sweet, no buttery taste at all. Had ordered chicken lollipops they are great"
less quantity and quality while being more costly
I like d chinese most fried rice n noodles bet to have .....
late delivery
"Fish was not fresh , was a bit hard"
good food
food was spicy..they should lower spices..
super delivery guy
"The taste was paneer tikka masala was very cheap.
N that schezwan noodles was worst. But the tandoor roti was fab. If u charges a high cost for food then u should have to give a good quality food. Atleast tasty food."
"The biryani isn't good... Too dry, tasteless and bland.. However the chicken masala is just amazing.. Must try.. Delivery is also quick.. Have to try other stuff.."
Worst food.need to fish for chicken.extreem salty n spicy.crispy chicken is rubber n salty.kichiri for baby was so dry n hard.got insulted from staff coz I dare to ask y they were late.....so on
Good place and great taste ..nice ambience... biryani was awesome.. friendly staffs and manager.. highly recommend.. place is located in thakur village
Best place in thakur village for sea food.and chinese triple rice is awesome.staff are friendly excellent place for hangout.try chinese foods.chicken lollipop is very good.party hall is also available.i had my birthday party there the quantity of food is excellent.music was also available.
"We were a group of 7 people sitting arrangements for groups was really good. We had ordered panner masala with naans. Hongkong noodles
Chicken chilly and american chopsuey. The quantity of food was enough for all of us and also the service was quick. The total bill was around 800 something. Paisa total vasool. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"It‚Äôs not one of the best place BUT the BEST place to have your meals. ‚ù§Ô∏è. One should definitely try it‚Äôs Tandoori chicken Tikkas Prawn Fry.
I had ordered Prawn gravy and chicken hariyali tikka with butter naan and jeera rice. The tikka was so soft and so fresh butter naan was soft and tasty unlike other restaurants they did not apply less butter, quantity was enough and sufficient.

One should definitely visit. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
"PLACE : OK. They have both AC and non-AC. Ambiance is fair. The only fault is that non AC have some noise
Service: Nice. There was a waiter in AC who is decent and overall service was nice.
Food Quality: Thik thak.. Lollipop was little oily but chicken biryani was nice.
Food Quantity: Decent"
"Used to be very good and edible and reasonable , but I guess now maybe the staff has changed. Which has made the food terrible and hateful! Ordered the chicken tikka masala and crispy chicken. Crispy chicken was bland tasteless and not clean , chicken tikka masala was ""chicken Maggi masala"". And the naan was thick like winter blanket . Disappointed"
"Pathetic hotel. Food quality is very bad.
Don't ever visit and waste your money.
Ambience: 1star.... It took almost 45 mins to get order.
Ordered veg american chopsuey...Came with egg flavour.
Ordered Chicken handi..came with watery gravy and uncooked pieces.
And they bloody charge 80Rs. Extra for boneless chicken.
Overall experience was horrible."
Nice food.... home like taste and well prepared.. most go sometimes to have desi like food...fast service and also good hosptality..........
Nice restaurant... True Chinese food here... Tasty.. service was awesome... Delivery was on time... Can definitely try next time from this restaurant...
This place is Value for money. The chicken tava fry is great. Also try the egg masala omlette. One of the best ones i have ever had . The taste is just too good. The staff is very hospitable.
"Placed an order for chicken lollipop,veg triple schezwan fried rice and veg biryani.
Tripple schezwan fried rice and veg biryani wer really tasty,chicken lollipop was ok.
Will try other things on the menu soon."
"It's ok sort. Not so great.

The quality of food is not at all upto the mark. Tried food over here for many times but always have been disappointed. So, stopped!

Not much to say!"
"We had ordered chicken handi and butter naan. The naan were very thick and some of them were burnt from the edges, and had way too much sesame on them. The gravy didn't taste like chicken handi, the capsicum was overcooked and very few in number. The gravy had a fishy taste too. Very disappointing affair."
Good food ... service was a issue ... chicken lolly pop with gravy is the best ... smokers should be discontinued from this place as if u want to have a decent food in the non AC place u will find a lots of smokers there...
"Ordered Chicken Biryani and paneer chilly. Both were good. It is my experience
Food : Very Good
Staff : Good
Service : Okey
Ambiance : Poor.
I think parcel can be a good option from here.."
"Ordered for home delivery.
The delivery was fast. The prices are quite reasonable. We ordered Fish chilly, chicken in hot garlic sauce and mutton biryani. All three dishes were okay. Infact good. The bill came out to only 650. So this is a good place to order food for delivery. Dunno about their dining experience though."
"Food served at Aamantran is very good specially the Non - veg , I'm 100% sure that non-veg lovers will enjoy. Sea - food lovers must give a try here ! Vegetarians you will enjoy here too ..!"
"I have been a regular at Aamantran ,the food is good and excellent place for Non Veg , if u love sea food then a visit to Aamantran is must .
De Chineses too is very nice and well prepared
What's good about this place that dishes r prepared on a day to day basis and r fresh ,even the gravy used is prepared daily , dishes can be prepared according to your taste buds also , u need to tell them what u like it will be served accordingly
No left overs r served , they r consumed by the staff during their dinner,
Guys U must try this place for a change ,friendly owner and warm cordial staff"
"I have been to this restaurant many times. The food served here is truly best treat to your taste buds, and if you are a sea food lover I bet u must visit this place, can vouch it's better then Mahesh lunch home. Delivery was quick. Will surely recommend this restaurant."
"Bad food, rude staff - not sure how this place has survived for so long. Every time I have visited, they have taken the customer services to a new low. Avoid at all cost!!"
"I had once gone to these guys to get a quotation for a bulk order for about 80 persons from them. The captain on duty took down my details and the requirements and assured me that they shall call me back with the quote in a few hours. I received no such call from them.
 Next day I called them to ask about it, and the guy on the phone rudely tells me that they are very busy and that I sould walk down to their restaurant if I wanted to place the party order.
 Well, that order obviously went to some other restaurant, but you did lose a future customer before he even became one."
Good to order when u need food asap..... Decent food. No complaints.... Helps when in need. Open till 1130. So can order a little bit late.
"I really wish I had anything good to write about this place. Just sad! Food-bad, cleanliness - horrible, Staff - don't even know the menu ! We ordered two manchow soups-which was filled with chillies and spices, egg biriyani with raita - tasteless biriyani and raita was old and bitter. I wish I had not wasted my time and money here. The reason I even had a few bites coz we were starving. Avoid !!!!"
"I wonder why Thakur village has very few good Punjabi/veg restaurants.

Eaten here few months back not happy with the food at all ! :(
Totally disappointed!"
"I have been ordering food from Amantran from months, and that too min twice a month, but i can assure you, if you want to have your meal an hour after your meal time, call amantran for a home delivery. It took 1.5 hours to deliver Manchurian rice to a nearby place and the person on phone has loads of excuses like the delivery boy will be in locality, providing other order and half an hour later, he just left from the restaurant. Worst service ever. My suggestion will be to place an order in evening so that they can manage to deliver your food just before you sleep. I cant find a lower rating than this."
"The best sea food specialist restaurant that we can search for.. my favorite place to treat friends, family,colleagues with the best quality and tasty food....prawns, squid, lobsters,fish -are all my favorite dishes...so people enjoy the feel of home made sea food at this restaurant.."
"I can bet that you won't get ""Chilly Idly "" like aamantran anywhere in kandivli !!! i am a fan of their chilly idly !!! and a number of other delicacies ...shcezwan tandoori chicken ... chicken shashlik rice and much more !!!! The owner's love for food and service can be seen throughout!!!! Good Luck Guys !!!"
"Nice place to have food!

Idli chilli,
Mashroom chilli
& chicken chilli is good!

Noodles is bad"
"My favorite and the most visited restaurant. The seafood here is awesome. They can custom make the food the way u want. The Chinese food is also the best that I have tasted so far. I live in Sharjah, UAE & I am yet to find a restaurant here which serves food as tasty as Aamantran. So whenever I come down to Mumbai I make sure I taste all my favorite dishes in Aamantran."
"It Is very nice place to have Sea food and Udupi Style Non Veg ... When ever i travel to india from dubai i see to that i visit this Restaurant for sure..

If you do not taste the food there you will be miss something in your life.. : )"
good sea food cuisine never tasted. authentic chinese food
