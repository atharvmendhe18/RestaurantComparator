Review
"Special thanks to Vishal, Chetan and Subardi- the chef, for their excellent service"
Was really happy with the service! Amit was really cordial and gave great suggestions. Had a good evening
Two days back I ordered the same dish in the restaurant but when I order it for delivery the sauce is half the quantity the other condiments except noodles is also half and sliced lemon water chestnuts are missing also taste very different
Overly oily sauces
"The stir fry option is really good, with fresh ingredients. Highly recommend hunan + sweet chilli sauce. Amit, our server was very friendly and helpful.
100% will go again."
"had been to this restaurant a few years back so was super excited to revisit. but unfortunately had a horrible experience. the server had a constant scowl on his face.. he was also very un accommodating. dint enjoy my meal at all, was a complete let down. not to mention that the options for vegetarians are bare minimum."
We have been to this restaurant a couple of times and we just love the food here. The concept is great and the flavours are lovely. The staff is pleasant and very courteous. Amit our server has been great every time we have visited.

"noodle is oily, average taste, not worth the high price tag"
Had a great time. The food was lovely and the service was amazing. We were served by Mr.Amit who was polite and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner date .
I visited all the stir fry to celebrate my birthday I absolutely loved the place and the ambience. A special shoutout to Rahul who was very courteous and also surprised us with a small pastry to celebrate my birthday. Would definitely visit again and try the quick woks
Good food
food was decent. but the service was impeccable especially Vishal. He made the experience great.

All stir fry has always been my all time favorite. We usually come here for the quick woks. This time we tried A la carte this time. Our host Amit was really courteous and helped us select good options from the menu.
"Always a great time at All Stir Fry. The food is great, chefs are very accommodating and Amit was very helpful through dinner. Thank you!"
Amazing food and service. Wide selection of delicious dishes. Our host Amit was super helpful and courteous. Definitely plan to visit again
"They charged us 18% GST for food when it is in fact 5%

Food was terrible and not expected for ‚Çπ1349 per person.

We were really looking forward to this and you must avoid"
ok great show
Wish the outlet was a bit more liberal with the prawns. Otherwise everything else about the food was fine.
"We visited all stir fry - as a table for 10 people. We had taken a reservation and informed the restaurant that we are coming by with kids for a 7 pm reservation.
After taking our table at the corner of the restaurant and with the restaurant more than half empty, the manager comes to one of the mothers telling her that the 2 year old child in the high chair needs to be taken out of the restaurant and feed them out.
When we told them that when no one has complained and you cannot tell a mother to walk out in a family friendly restaurant they said you can leave . The manager threatened security , refused to apologise , constantly threw ego . For a place that we have been regular diners...read more"

"Revisited this place after years and had an amazing time yet again!
Special shoutout to Vishal who made our experience worthwhile :)"
i have been extremely disappointed with the service. The manager was not at all co-operative. being such a big restaurant the behaviour was unprofessional. I would think 1000 times before visiting this place.

"I will be sorry to see my favourite restaurant of many years shut down soon. I have gone to this place every few weeks over the years and have taken guests many many times to dine here. I loved this place until today when I was served raw food ( beans and pumpkin wasn‚Äôt cooked properly) coke was flat, cocktails were mediocre and the service was polite but scarce. The food used to be amazing here but it‚Äôs quite evident now that the restaurant is probably going out of business as it can‚Äôt afford a decent chef anymore who knows beans take longer to cook. The restaurant was empty at lunch time. We had the whole place to ourselves ‚òπÔ∏è"

Very disappointing

the benches are very uncomfortable to sit without backrests. you need to have chairs instead of benches. I love the food but sitting is very uncomfortable.
