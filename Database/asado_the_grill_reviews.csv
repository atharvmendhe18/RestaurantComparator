Review
Loved the food and ambience. Giving 1 rating as it says offering Sunday brunch and same not available. This is very misleading and needs to be rectified.
"Don't go to this place. Surprised at the 3,9 on Zomato.
If you are used to the regular 3.5+ of Bandra, the ambience, service and the food, you are in the wrong place, like we are right now."
"Passed this place many times ... so finally decided to try it....Went with my wife and a couple of friends...We loved the decor of the place... On entering the restaurant it feels like one is transported to a way side cafe in spain or mexico...The staff is quick with service... but lacking a bit in knowledge about the food they serve...The bar menu is good.. well stocked..nice cocktails...i had the mojito latino (mojito with a jalopeno twist) which was refreshingly different... We ordered the nachos and bbq chicken wings as starters... it was impressive....For mains we tried the enchiladas (some came without dirty rice and bean even though it was the same dish ) , pasta and fajita it was...read more"
"Went to for dinner last night. The kitchen was set to shut because it was too late but they made an exception for us and were very cordial about it. Ordered a mojito and a margarita. Both were made strong as asked! Started with the chicken nachos. It was good but they could do with some more nachos. Then came the prawn fajitas. Again, good but more Indian that Mexican. Tortillas looked/tasted like paranthas. However, phenomenal service throughout the meal. Ambience is top notch. I'd like to believe that their other fare is better (steaks etc) so I'll definitely go again to try that."
"Superb food and very ""cute"" interiors. We started off with the chicken nachos, potato skins and habanero bbq chicken wings. The wings were a bit crisp and spicy (as expected). Taco potato skins were superb and served with guacamole. Nachos could have done with more cheese. Lots more cheese.
For the mains we had the chorizo chicken roulade which was basically chicken stuffed with mince and laid out on a bed of potatoes and drizzled with chocolate sauce. Very innovative and tasty preparation.

Will definitely go back to sample more of their exotic fare."
"This place in Bandra is indeed the only and the best Latin American place in Mumbai. Read on to learn more about what this place has to offer:. Asado is coming up as a very prominent place around Bandra as they have some promising finger licking food, flavors (That know no bounds) & ambiance that is hard to ignore. From perfect dim lights to the fresh and hot Latin dishes this particular place is garnering all the attention since it has kick-started."
"This place is beyond expectations! Every thing was so authentic and delicious! Must go!
We where just looking for a nice place to have dinner. Instead we had a blast!"
"Driving by several times, Asado never really impressed me. The black sign board with the name of the restaurant in large flaming letters reminded me of a tacky nightclub and the plastic sheets covering the front of the restaurant didn’t reassure me either.
But, let Asado be a lesson to me never to judge a restaurant by its entrance!
We sat in the outdoor section, which was pleasantly spacious and done up in a sort of European/ Spanish style. Let me honestly say that the ambience is definitely overdone and gives you the sense that they are “trying too hard”—subtlety is more my style and I’d have preferred understated references to the Spanish/ Mexican cuisine! Having said that...read more"
"Place not to be visited again. I was taken for a toss here, ambience k in pics amazing bit in actual dull n silent. No crowd totally empty when ever u want u can step in no need of reservation.
Cocktails too bitter can't have it at all, only mango slush n watermelon moito good in mock tails.
Do not order for Escalalda, Green veg wrap. Rawas Fish is worth trying, quesadillas worth trying, Cottage cheese dish worth having, Prawn soup 1 should have. Do not try Thin based bread not good.
Manager friendly they take an initiative to replace and give u a new dish which u do not like. Waiters friendly.
But seriously food needs to improve a lot."
"Awesome food. Will go back again. Service was excellent. Shld try potato skins, edmame risotto and truffle mushroom flat bread. Will recommend to everyone."
"I heard a lot about the brunch in this place but unfortunately went for dinner. However I was not disappointed the food was good and so were the drinks.
The place has a nice thing going after 10:30pm where you can order unlimited drinks from a choice of 4 for Rs. 899/- which my friends took advantage of.
The place is a little pricey and can cost you anywhere between Rs. 1200-2000/- per person.

I however Would go here again, if not frequently."
"A 5 for the cocktails and a 4.5 for the food.

The Pork Ribs falling of the bone were awesome - the accompanying truffled mashed potatoes made it one the best in Mumbai.

The Roasted Chicken flat bread - bread so thin that you can only taste the chicken. Great.

The Meal in A Bowl was amazing - the customisation to make it spicy made it really a nice dish.

The cocktails were amazing - Latino Mule, Mojito Latino, Sangria, Jalapeño infused beer and rum cocktails- some of the best we have tasted in Mumbai Mexican joints.

Finally Churros - fantastic!!!!

Surely coming back for more."
"If you want close to authentic Mexican food than head over to Asado. I had their veg nachos as my appetizer and habanero chicken fajitas for my main. All I can say is it was fantastic! Great taste done similar to what I've had in Los Angeles, second best place for Mexican food outside of Mexico. This place also has real tequila not Jose Cuervo which isn't made from Blue agave. Anyways check this place out if you know anything about Mexican food you won't be disappointed."
"We went here on Monday night, the entire restaurant was empty but we decided to take a chance anyway. Bad decision! Average food, seriously overpriced, very pretentious vibe overall."
Food is not at all good.. Stale and undercooked salad... The Tortilla chips in the nachos were soggy... The service was slow... The overall experience was not the at all great.. Everyone had stomach problems the next day.. We were 4 of us and non of us enjoyed and we all were feeling sick the next day.. The only good thing was the tomato salsa sauce and the guacamole that's about it. Overall experience not at all good.
"Had a great brunch with friends lovely staff and very good cocktails, really good food, try the pork ribs in the grill section, it really was a great time with friends!!"
"A newly opened place located just around the corner, gives you the feel of Latin culture from ambience to food to service and music. The place is nicely built with simple yet catchy interiors and the best part are the lights which will catch your attention from start till you leave. They have a good variety of drinks which are special and most with a touch of spices which was a great experience and the food was simply breath taking, the pork chops and the chicken risotto were to die for. The sushi and prawns lacked a bit flavour but they were not that bad. Now lets come to the best part about this place which was their service which was extremely outstanding, they helped us with our...read more"
"Best place to start your weekend. They have amazing Sunday brunch menu which many innovative dishes. They serve grilled dishes over the stone which is totally insane. Been there with friends for brunch and fell in love with the place. Perfect ambience with dim lights and beautiful paintings on the wall. The staff is courteous and serves you with love. Serves great cocktails which will definitely make u tipsy. Had the yummiest risotto till date. They served us with complimentary dessert which was called ""Tresleches"" which was amazzziiinnngg. Would love to visit the place again and again."
"This is supposed to be the only place that serves south American cuisine.! When we went there, it was still pretty new. The food menu is quite limited, especially for the veg nuts. The presentation of the food is carefully done. And the food is quite yummy. The best part is that there is no Mexican food to dilute the authentic South American menu! The decor is refreshing."
"Asado hosts an insane brunch over the weekend, perfect warm up for a Saturday night or a lazy laughter filled Sunday.

The brunch has live Dim Sum, Sushi and waffle counters, so you can spoil yourself with sinfully delicious waffles or Sushi and Dim Sum with flavours that fit perfectly on your pallet."
"Pretty open and quaint ambience (outside, since I live to smoke). Quite an indulgent and well spoken staff, something you seldom come across in Bombay. Solution oriented and willing to indulge. Yet to taste the main course, but the starters were pretty decent. Awaiting the main course from the grill, but was impressed with the service and had to write. And pretty decent Latin music."
"The 4 mushroom fettuccini, the truffle risotto,enchiladas are few of my favorites and definitely a must try. The place is extremely cute,staff is friendly and the menu is extensive. Definitely will be returning to this place. Absolute value for money."
"For a place that gave us a bill of 3000 for 2 one would honestly expect more. Starting from an ambiance that's too blah to write about, to waiter laying a dirty serviette on my lap (which I obviously pointed out to get changed), a second waiter getting our order of wine wrong and serving us Brut instead of Chenin Blanc, extremely intrusive service, to being served BURNT BLACK PASTA and having restaurant Manager tactlessly apologize and offer a different dish...everything that could go wrong went wrong. We were even charged for the burnt pasta which in any ordinary restaurant if I had complained about being burnt would have at least offered to be taken off the charges. The only saving...read more"
"Heard mixed reviews about this place but would totally recommend it .. Loved the ambience and Latin music playing in the background.. With little birdies put up everywhere!
- Veggie Nachos (so fresh & yum)
- TexMex Loaded Potatoe Skin (very differently made)
- Grilled Veg Flatbread (tasted like pizza)
- Edamame Truffle Risotto (is to die for)
- Tres Leches (3 milk dessert - I have originally eaten in New York - too delicious)
And 2 more dishes phew hogged that night ...

Would love to go again and try other dishes as well"
"I reallllly liked this place.. Made really cutely.. Simply done up n a chilled out place
In jain he made me a really yummy nachos with sour cream and veges
For the main course a jain white sauce pasta.. Which was also delicious..
In non jain he gave us some spinach lasagne which my friends said was reallly good too..
Desserts we had the eggless banoffee pie."
"This place has an exquisite sushi bar, a waffle counter, a wine selection a European restaurant facing River Thames would be proud of, excellent entres and a very pleasing ambiance. I would definitely visit again. The service could be improved, I thought they had a bit too much of staff for a place of this size. My favourite items included the ThaI Curry, the nachos were good, The Chicken Enchilada is worth trying and basically everything on the menu was pretty good. 

The Sushi is something they are trying but we got to try it and it was quite good. The bar has any beer your imagination could conjure, I like that it is placed without a lot of pubs and bars around. The cooling was just...read more"
"Bandra is my favourite place in Mumbai and i love to discover new places around the corners of Bandra... And just to expect a restaurant on SV Road is something interesting!

I am curious chipmunk to know about concept and servings, when it's a restaurant with now / recently open phrase...as i am very peculiar about eating anything or everything. Hence, i prefer to check the reviews about any place before i visit either through friends or online. And i was surprised about the comments post my experience.

I came here with my friends for lunch when I don't want anything fancy. One thing which was surely not to miss is the decor & Courteous staff.

"There’s a new Latin grill that has opened up in Bandra West – Asado Latin Grill! Without further ado, let’s just jump right into it; here’s what my friend and I tried out –

Peach Iced Tea & Virgin Mojito: Both beverages tasted great, although we preferred the refreshing quality of the Virgin Mojito more!

Cauliflower Pistachio & Gorgonzola Soup: Definitely worth ordering, this soup was full of rich flavors and we loved the fact that the soup wasn’t overtly creamy nor was it unnecessarily watered down. Delicious!

Tex Mex Loaded Potato Skins: The Tex Mex Loaded Potato Skins tasted excellent, and the potato skins weren’t annoyingly over-crisp like at most places – however...read more"
"Decided to try 'Asado' which had caught our eye on our daily commute. Greeted with a complimentary bread basket with 3 different & flavorful dips, although noted there weren't any brown or whole wheat options. Next we went on to a delicious starter- Nachos, extra guacomole was provided on request at no charge. For our mains I ordered the lamb from the live lava stone grill with the Argentinian chimichuri sauce and my husband had the tequila flambé prawns, apparently their signature dish which I wished I had ordered instead of the lamb as it was pretty good ! The Lamb was so so and nothing to write home about. We weren't expecting to have dessert but were pleasantly surprised to hear they...read more"

"First off, the great ambience, make you feel like you're siting at a corner of a Barcelona street, the detailing and the artwork, fantastic!

The staff are super courteous! From the reservation, to the warm towels, to the little fact that the kiwi on my kiwi mint smoothie fell off and they got me another two slices of it :D (its all about the little things no?)

Ordered the pork belly, found a few pieces a little tough to get through, then went for the chicken enchiladas, which was good.

Their drink suggestions were really good,be it the alcoholic or the non-alcoholic kind!

Nice place, a little pricey, but give it a shot! 'Nuff said!"
Hey Guys. Aweosome place. I was there for a quick grab. Just had a cocktail and their noachos. I must tell you i need to go there again to try lot more. Captain Dheraj suggested a superb cocktail which is worth having. Planning to visit sunday evening again with my gang.
"The place looks decent but I guess not many people know about it and it hasn't gained much attention as the food isn't that great.

We ordered the Nachos which had very little cheese sauce. The salsa, beans and guac was literally just sprinkled in. The food taste was average.

The reason I give this a bad rating is because all of us who dined there had an upset stomach the next morning. So fed it was be food quality.

Yes not to forget the frozen margarita was so frozen that I could barely sip it. And yes it didn't have enough alcohol too.

Never going there again. Travelled to bandra all the way from town. Not worth it."
"Naaiiicceeee place!!
This an underrated restaurant for sure. Lovely place, dunno why it's not in the talks.. Awesome ambience, fab food, courteous staff, they recommend their specialities particularly.

Very well made mojitos, one of the best made cocktails. We had everything on the recommendations of the staff. Stuffed, baked potatoes that was so well made, not too cheesy, with veggies in it.. We asked for a fish starter, for which we were told to have the Australian fish that was an absolute delight. The side and sauce accompanying it were yummyyy.. We asked for the pasta alio olio with prawns which wasn't as great. Expected it to be spaghetti, but it came in penne, not too happy about...read more"
"A lovely new place. Warmth, sophistication and food that does interesting without compromising on taste. Mexican mules, an excellent beer collection ( which they actually stock), good cocktails."
"Not sure what to say exactly about Asado... But, here goes...

Arrived around 8:45 for dinner on a Saturday night with reservations. It's a big space with a lot of welcoming, friendly n super attentive staff. First thing I noticed is that though this is a newer place, the chairs, dishware, and napkins all had stains on them, which made me feel a lil weary of the quality of the food.

To my surprise, the nacho and jacket potato appetizers, as well as the bread basket n dips were decently good.

Unfortunately, the mains were not. I paid 400Rs for two very small BBQ paneer wraps. I have a very small appetite or so everyone tells me, but let's just say that even I left hungry.

"Asado has come exactly where local burger joint Bembos was located in Bandra. A friend of mine suggested this joint and a few days later we were in Asado for Dinner. As you walk in you couldn't stop noticing the amazing latin american & picturesque decor they have done to this place. We occupied our table and after going through the menu tried the following:

1. Chicken and Bacon Wrap Dates Anticucho - In starters we tried Chicken and Bacon Wrap Anticucho. Basically Chicken & Cheese stuffed Bacon wrap dates was served with green salad. It was unique and really nice. We simply loved the combination.
2. Crispy Hoisin Chicken Wrap -  Crispy Chicken with Hoisin sauce was served in a flour...read more"
"I came here yesterday with my lil sister. To start of, the ambience is pretty cool. The staff, supremely courteous! We ordered the pork ribs and the manager was more than happy to suggest sides that go well with it. The ribs, OMG! so amazing! It was so tender it was falling of the bone. Though I prefer to be able to chew my meat off :p
We also ordered the grilled pomfret with risotto. I'm not a huge fan of risotto, so I liked the ribs more.
But none the less, it was an amazing dining experience and I'm visiting Asado again, for sure!"
"I've been planning to visit Asado for quite sometime now, and it just so happened that when I did land up, they were hosting the Spanish Festival with the menu curated by none other than Spanish Michelin-starred Chef Guillem Vidal.

We were the first guests walking in and had the privilege of more than a tête-à-tête with the master-chef, but were given an overview of the cuisine and recommended dishes as well!

While the ambiance and music did play its part, the general atmosphere was certainly not bringing out the theme - props like hats and flowers in the hair doesn't quite mean anything if you don't wear the mood...the gentleman singing music was more comfortable with hindi...read more"
"Went here for an early dinner with the family on a Sunday night. We were the first ones (and only ones!) throughout the time we spent there. Dad had been there before so he knew quite a few members of the staff, and that ensured very warm and courteous service as soon as they recognized us. 
Started off with the red wine sangria and their bread basket. Really loved the sauces from all across latin america with special mention to the one with peanuts. Even the bread rolls and straws were soft and warm, and they went well with each of the 3 dipping sauces. I like places that don't serve only a slab of butter (or herbed butter for that extra effort) :)

"Well this is one of those places that is very low key, frequented very less by people but is a gem of a place. We decided to come here on a Saturday for dinner and made prior reservations. Yayy for that!! We arrived at about 8 PM and the place was totally empty!! I am not kidding, completely empty. Anyhow we got a nice cozy table. The staff here is super courteous and attentive. The menu is mostly Mexican. So, we ordered a Veg Empanada with Jalpenos and Dates. This came pretty quick and was super crispy though deep fried. For mains we ordered a Baked Pie and Pork Ribs. The Pork Ribs were super soft, yumm, juicy and tender, they were a real delight and jem of a dish. The taste was super...read more"
"This Latin American restaurant impresses you in every way.To me service is more important than even food and thus this restaurant gets a star more cause of its courteous service.The food here is equally good.I am not much of a Mexican Argentinian or Brazilian foodie but trying the dishes here surely make want to try some more of the variety they serve here.They also have a really good range of wines and tequilas ,so if you like to have a nice relaxed dinner with you're date or family or a few friends .Asado is the place to go."
"Hot Summer Afternoon, Entered this place, which was relatively empty, they have both outdoor as well as indoor seating, Outdoor seating is covered and have air cool blowers. Entered in, Seated, The Staff were polite and courteous, they have very limited menu to choose from. Chose Lemon Ice Tea, Some Potato Skins, Veg Fajita Wrap, Great Quantity on food, must appreciate that. The Food was pretty decent, the decor and ambience were pretty nice, since there were only two other tables occupied. It's a good place to chill out on a weekend evening, they have good liquor menu. A Bit Highly Priced"
The decor was super cute... It's inspired by he streets of Barcelona... The walls were full of paintings... Loved the lighting... Mocktail and food was average... Dessert was super awesome!!! They have only 2 desserts: Churros and Three Milk Cake... Both were too good! Must go there for the desserts if not anything else...
"Being a new joint, this place is a new refereshing addition to the bandra scene. The ambience just adorable with well placed artpieces on the wall. The staff was courteous and we were the first ones to enter it in a Saturday evening..the cocktails and mocktails were neatly made. We loved the habanero BBQ chicken and the seafood grilled salad with a superbly light and delicious dressing..the kafiti prawns were a new thing but small in portion size. In mains we ordered a sezarro chicken fajita but the only thing starkly absent in the menu is desserts..they have cake and churros, which the staff mentions to you..but the menu needs to be extended a bit, as very few places serve only pasta but...read more"

"So this place isn't exactly the easiest to find. We went up and down SV road a couple of times because Zomato's location wasn't accurate and Google Maps didn't even have a listing. The manager on duty was very helpful and came and stood on the street to help us find the restaurant.

So we got seated, my wife and I. The decor is simply beautiful. They've recreated a little village complete with sparrows loitering on overhead wires. There's an outdoor-type air conditioned seating area as well.

The staff knew the menu well and took our orders. We started off with the quesadillas and the flatbread. Both were delicious. The salsa they have is quite amazing. It's familiar yet new. For the main...read more"

Their main course was delicious, ordered johndary and baby chicken. Loved what we ordered, the server helped us to chose. They don't have a desserts menu/desserts on their menu. The dessert we ordered was some house dessert which was really bad and that was the only option. They should work on their desserts menu or not serve dessert at all.
The service is good"

We ordered almost everything on the menu except the desserts
We loved the BBC wings., spare ribs, chicken rough El. And the pasta
The lamb was too dry.not meaty.n do sauce tasted like green puddina chutney
Nothing different in to cuisine
Almost d same as Mexican n continental...

Service was good.
The staff was very attentive and well trained
Could do a lot better

And for the pricing ; overpriced for my liking"
"Two fellow gastronomers and I were debating where to have dinner, when we finally settled upon trying Asado. We would come to learn that this was an excellent choice, and this is by far, one of the best meals I have eaten in Mumbai.

The restaurant itself, is well designed, and has a warm, cheerful appearance to it. The place mats, which were cut stone slabs, gave a unique twist to the decor. The tables had sufficient cutlery to see you through a few courses without having to ask for more, and the salt and pepper grinders were uniform, and were a good size. None of that small flimsy stuff you see at most places.

We were greeted by warm smiles, right from the valet parking attendant. This...read more"

"Cute decor, apt music, good food and great watermelon Virgin mojito. Great service too ?? love the gun they gave with Bill. Very quirky. Good experience overall. I will go there again ?"
"Nice place... As Mexican as it can get which doesn't mean it's Mexican. Ambiance was good, service was very good. The drinks are good and they will happily tweak you drinks to your style if needed. Ordering the food I would say the breadbasket was the best. Food doesn't taste Mexican at all but when asked the management said this works for the customer and they don't want or handle authentic Mexican food. To that I didn't have much to say.

Overall it great for drinks but if you like Mexican food it may it be the place. At least for me."
"Had been planning to try out this place since a while.. And to no surprise turned out to be amazing.. Brilliant food, superb cocktails, good ambience, Nice service.. Just a perfect evening u would wish for.."
"This is a newly opened place in a quiet corner of Bandra. But as you enter, you know it's a perfect place to spend quality time and eat some great food! Very well presented food and drinks. Quite a lot of new flavours and so tasty!! Definitely going back again for some great looking and great tasting food.
I was just disappointed with no desserts on the menu. Although the manager gave us 2-3 options, but I would have loved to see a good spread, afterall how can you end a great meal without desserts!@"
Excellently flavoured food & superb service by Manager Maniraj & his team . Creative dishes on menu & well executed . Gd ambience to match too
"The moment you step into Asado you know you're about to enter into a whole new experience. It's ambiance is perfect and compliments extremely well for a date or nice girls night out. Soft latino music along with courteous staff only reassures you of a good time.

When you enter you are greeted with warm towels which currently doesn't happen anywhere I've been in Mumbai (these little gestures enhances one's experience). We ordered the chorizo flat bread which was exquisite along with the chicken roulade. Both dishes were beyond expectations. In the beginning you also get bread with some amazing dips (these dips can bitch slap any dish you could possibly order)

"A fine fine experience with good ambience, service n food to match. It's more of a meat lovers paradise, but we vegetarians too enjoyed the food.

Must say their read basket is v good."
Good variety of Latin food. Enclosed porch with view of the street. Attentive and professional staff. A bathroom whose decor will make you feel like you're in a dream.
To start with the food its quite OK service is also prompt but beware of these sweet cons they are big time cheats they cheat you in the bill they mention service charge@5% but charge you @7 % on top of that they even charge you service tax on the entire bill we were in a hurry so just paid and left only the next day we realised we were cheated usually people just check and tally the number of items and total amount but please while visiting this restaurant you a have a similar experience please bring it to the management notice
"Painted walls, dim lights and servers who know their menu well. Loved the food bread basket with sauces were yum, pork chops were delish and the cocktail drink was with perfect amount of alcohol. The only thing a little out of mark was restaurant made chorizo which seemed like minced meat. Over all a pleasant experience."
"Got around to trying this place out rather late. its been a considerable amount of time since it opened its pretty doors claiming to be a one stop halt for cost effective, tasty and fun food and drinks coupled with a great ambience and good service.

To begin with the latter is true and delivers as promised. The decor is quaint and sweet. The walls are covered in Latin street paintings and the lighting is dim and peaceful. The tables are pre-laid and the service is warm.

"Asado, a Latin American Restaurant in the city! A place that sure does know the difference between the wine glasses which definitely gives them some brownie points. We entered and it just seemed like a perfect place to be on a Saturday night. A place well designed so much so, it's absolutely a challenge to get past their paintings and murals. The staff is extremely attentive, courteous and efficient.

Also the new improved malt and wine list is great

"Went to Asado on a Friday night and got a table easily as we had a reservation from before. This place seems like a good comparable to Sancho's, if you are looking for one, that is, with an addition of a very courteous and attentive staff.
The ambience was decent, dim-lit, but the smoking area smelled quite weird. We took a place inside and as recommended, ordered Habanero Chicken Wings, which were really good and I would totally suggest that they should have a boneless version of the same too. We followed this with a Chicken Enchilada which came with Rice and Beans. Both the dishes were very well made and the mexican flavours I love were definitely there!

"The reviews seemed interesting so visited Asado for dinner. The ambience was really great, pretty and spacious. The music was apt. We started with a few drinks. The Mojito Latino and Chilcano were great. The service was good. We were generously offered two bread baskets with some great dips. So far so good. We moved on to our order. The recommended nachos weren't anything like expected and we were extremely disappointed after the great start. We then ordered the Portobello mushroom steak which only added to our disappointment; definitely not worth the money as well. That left us in no mood even try anything else. Wouldn't recommend for food; drinks were the saviour."
We went to asado with a group of 5 girlfriends on a Friday night. We were irritated as we could not find the place and they haven't put up maps on zomato & even the address mentioned here is false. So we somehow managed to get there n boom all our irritation was subsided by the great service n ambience. Its a pretty small place. Indoors and outdoors seating is available. So we ordered mocktails &food and from where should I start the food was MIND BLOWING!

"Asado Latin Grill is a new Latin American themed restaurant in Mumbai and we were happy to be invited to attend their inaugural dinner. The place promises to offer a lot of uncommon food experiences to people, lava grill being the centre of attention. The ambience inside is not great as the painted walls feel a little awkward but the outdoor seating is really good. They have somewhere tried to overdo things a bit and it shows on the kind of bulky cutlery and not so needed stone slab plates on those small tables. They are trying to feature in the fine dine segment but such a place is quite far from being a fine dine experience.

To start with in general, the place is somewhat confusing as...read more"
Went for dinner on Sunday night..Food v average..the pasta was a bit too oily...service was gud..the ambience was gud
"This place used to be a Hyundai showroom, from where I purchased my car. Now it is a well-lit, well spaced out fine dining restaurant.

The food is, without a shadow of a doubt, outstanding. Generous, flavoursome, and cooked to perfection.

We started with the complimentary bread basket and some spreads. A suggestion to the chef - your smoked aubergine should be bottled and sold. Delicious. Equally good was the nacho la carne. Crisp nachos, good sour cream, yummy mince.

My fiend ordered the chicken roulade for the main course, while I had the lamb chops. I have eaten lamb chops in a lot of places, but none come close. The meat fell of the bone like dripping butter, and just melted in the...read more"
"Where do I start about the place? Perhaps at the top. I walked in to see two wine glasses already placed at the table. One for white and one for red. Thought that is a very smart way to get people to savour the wine. The waiters on duty were very prompt, courteous and efficient. A huge plus point. They promptly brought a bread basket to our table which came along wit three dips. By far one of the best bread baskets we had ever had. The bread was hot and fresh and the dips were really interesting. We ordered the nachos Carne for starters and that too aced it. Then came the drinks. We were going non alcoholic tonight and so it was a pinacolada for me and an apple cinnamon for my...read more"
"So my husband and I went to the newly opened Latin American / Mexican /Argentinian (whatever you want to call it ) resto opened in bandra ! Location wise its definitely a plus , you cannot miss this place on sv road ! So that's that , moving forward we had a reservation considering it is a weekend , however there was not much crowd when we went (10:30pm) ! But don't judge the book by its cover , as we entered we were greeted by the manager , given a choice of table and we chose to sit in the outside section (p.s one of the reviews here mentions mosquitoes , but gladly we did not have any such issue ) guess its rectified !
The staff is very well informed about the dishes and they do give...read more"

"My fiance n me love trying new places.. N this place is very close to his apartment.. So thought of trying it.. To start with d nachos was fantastic so was d soup.. N chicken wrap was one of d most delicious thing I've ever had..
Good ambience a full 5 for it.. But for a Friday night d place was surprisingly empty.. V left d place by 10 30pm.. N showhow it never managed to get crowded... D staff courtesy was lovely ... The major complain v had with d food was it wasn't hot... Especially d soup... Was a ok experience.. I believe for gener of food and pricing thr r a lot restaurans who provide a better culinary experience .. I m nt sure if I would suggest this place.."
"Was looking for a place to take my date on Sunday somewhere in Bandra. Checked Zomato and found Asado as a trending restaurant this week. Although I am not a big fan of Grill, still went with my girlfriends choice and reached Asado. I never thought will see a full house restaurant at 10 pm. We are lucky to get a corner table at the outside area. We had a Bottle of Italian Red wine, a seafood salad , a lobster lava stone grill and Sweet potato Gnocchi. I am so impressed with the quality of food and the presentation. The Lobster was awesome and the gnocchi. We tried Grappa Shots at the end instead of any dessert. I really enjoyed the service standard and clean and crispy atmosphere at...read more"
"Delicious food and excellent service.. :)

After hearing a lot about the place from all of my friends, I finally planned to check it out with a group of friends...The ambiance is nice...I particularly loved the decor, its vibrant...The menu is also beautifully done...They have a large selections of World Wine and Tequila available. I got Crazy after seeing the Pistol shaped Bottled with Tequila, and its unique in taste too. We ordered a glass of Red Sangria, Gooney Goo and Mojito Latino. The Mojito was perfectly blended with Jalapeno. From Food we ordered Seafood Soup, Vegetable Wrap, Crispy Calamari and Chicken and Dates Anticucho. The Anticucho was so perfectly balanced with Dates and...read more"
"An argentinian experience opens up at the same venue where a long time back an argentinian burger joint sat. Poetic isn't it.

And as you enter the place you do feel like you are transported to another world all together. The lights, the lack of traffic noise, the colours and the costumes do have a Hispanic influence.

The food in itself was good. We had ordered the nachos, a couple of beers, a risotto and a steak. Liked the nachos, really liked the risotto.

The steak however was a massive disappointment because it was a bad cut which had additionally been poorly cooked. Thats pretty much the reason to deduct 1.5points

The larger problem I faced was that the food wasn't different from...read more"
