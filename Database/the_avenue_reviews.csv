Food is good. But very expensive.
did not follow the instructions
The Manchow soup was not at all like authentic Manchow. There wasn‚Äôt enough ginger. Not spicy at all. It was like any roadside street food stall soup. SHAME!
""
It‚Äôs not at all handi biriyani. Boneless boiled chicken strips with more masala and less rice. Stop naming it as handi chicken biriyani. It‚Äôs more of tawa pulao with tons of masala. Its very disheartening to pay 750rs for this kind of cheating
manchow soup can be better
Delivered Non Veg soup instead of Veg soup
worst Fist time Just ignored by all the staff MADE to wait unnecessarily despite there being no clients One of the must horrible experiences I have had on a new year's eve afternoon lunch STAFF was busy passing time with each other and ignorjng us MOST UNPROFESSIONAL

did not follow the instructions
the Food had spilled
"nice food
good fast service"
"it was too hot and spicy. Punjabi grill is not hot and spicy. maybe you don't know. secondly, I called the restaurant and requested not to sprinkle anything on the chicken after taking it out of the Tandoor. but my instructions were ignored. very bad experience of The Avenue. please listen to your customer carefully. thanks"
total you have taken from me is 6282 whereas the bill is only 5950.
Poor packing
Stinking !
None till date has beaten the taste of Avenue made fried rice with Manchurian.. but the price is too exorbitant..
chicken pices were less

Had ordered for veg manchow soup and got some creamy gravy.. can‚Äôt even guess what it was.. quality of sweet corn soup very poor. Overall bad experience was bad..
no value for money.. it is too costly. restaurant price is less
"Soup was very tasty ; but unfortunately the Chef was very negligent; there were 2 white wire type plastic s in the soup! Dangerous eating‚Ä¶ could have had stuck in the throat; the Chef should be taken for task for such gross Negligence!

Naan was not cooked properly
We ordered food from The Avenue last night. We had ordered some chicken biryani. Next day me and my husband had severe acidity. The food was spicy and oily and very basic in taste. The food quality was pathetic. Not recommended at all. Never ever will order again from this place. Worst experience
the soup did not taste good at all

the quantity was very very less for the price and the taste was not that great
Taste is awesome! But rate for paneer chilli is overpriced. Also the other rates on their zomato menu card are overpriced

"MUNCHOW SOUP WAS WORST , tasteless and too much watery as well. This is not at all expected from the restaurant Avenue which is our regular outlet for dinner"

"A very good place to dine in with family and friends. They have huge variety of menu having all the varieties.
They have very common taste in food but the ambiance is good‚Ä¶"
Doesn‚Äôt taste like Dal Makhani at all. Chef should really learn to make basic dal makhani. Worst dal makhani I have had till date.
Paneer chilly ordered on 21st July was not upto the mark tastewise! I think the cook was different! Same dish i had ordered on 8th July and it was exceptionally tasty! So i ordered again but second time it was a complete disappointment. Why the taste is not consistent???
Paneer Do Pyaza was very below average compared to price they charge the dish didnt even had tomato puri its was only paneer which some brown gravy on top
