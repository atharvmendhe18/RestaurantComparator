Review
Veg thali was average but good for the price.chole bhature was having a generic taste with nothing special.All in all a highly underwhelming experience.go there to calm your hunger...But don't expect exquisite cuisine.
"#foodiefat - Didn't know I had just a jewel just besides my abode, wonderful family restaurant, it's on the second floor less crowd and great ambience, vibes are positive and with classic songs, really sets up the mood.
We ordered cream of mushroom soup - It took a while to arrive but as it was freshly done and tasted amazing its worth waiting.
Also tasted mushroom tikka just mouthwatering.
Finally tried Beetroot kebab - Tried it for the first time at a restaurant beetroot kebab stuffed with cheese a nice snack.

Loved the hospitality will surely visit more

Worst food ever. Please don't order from this restaurant looking at the rating. Have never given a review on Zomato but the food was so bad that I was forced review.
"Very nice place to visit with family and friends.
Good ambience. Good food.
Nice cordial place. Good staff. The entire staff attended to us very nicely.
Rates were reasonably okay and at par.
Only issue is, we had to pay by cash as the swipe machine was non functional and the staff were clueless about it's usage."
"- It's a pure veg restaurant.
- Very spacious- can accommodate almost 50 people.
- They organise parties. The whole can be booked in advance.
- Very humble staffs. Fast service.
- They serve the best veg dishes in Navi Mumbai."
"Please refer the attached image of communication between me and hotel owner. See the height of arrogance. We asked the hotel staff about not serving flavored water and cold finger bowl water they reply in a very rudely manner that these will be provided in evening and not bother to understand anything from us. When we communicated on FB, we got the same reply. Even they not want to turn ON AC. Please avoid using this hotel where hotel management not having hospitality manners and etiquette."
"Ordered special thali and really amused by the taste of all the items. Specially gatte ki sabji and jalebi,it was sumptuous.Highly recommend. Will try the dal bati as well."
"Ordered dal baati churma combination today... Because I had eaten it earlier at the restaurant itself it was yummy that time... But today it was pretty disappointing. The baati was stale... & Luke warm, felt as if it was reheated & given to me.one of the stuffing in the baati even had the stale & weird smell. Dal & churma were OK & just luke warm. I didn't even eat it completely even though I was super hungry & this was supposed to be my brunch.Not sure whether their quality has gone down in general or is it that they SEND STALE FOOD TO ONLiNE ORDERs? Very disappointed üëé"
"I had lunch yesterday at this restaurant on my way back from Khandala and found staff courteous.
Dal baati and masala chhaas with gatte ki subji was quite good. Gulab jamun with ice cream was also nice. The ambience and seating are quite comfortable.
I would recommend the place."
"Worst restaurant
Yesterday they fool my friend
Didn't give full order
Looted money
Bad staff behaviour
Don't order from this restaurant ever
Anukul sucks"
"Very bad experience with this restaurant
Cant give full order
Anukul is a cheater
Never ever order in this restro
They looted money from customers"
"Fantastic restaurant.....they prepare some authentic Rajasthani cuisine.....A MUST TRY....in Kharghar.......
Regular cuisine and ambience are also great
....."
Great place. Daal baati is worth coming here from far away. Polite staff and warm greetings from the staff along with mint water greets you when entering. May be the place is less known so less crowd is there as I didn't found any fault with food.
"I had ordered the special thali from Anukul. It was stated that i would get 4 rotis in it, but, surprisingly, there were 4 half rotis, which really makes them 2 rotis. I don't know if they make rotis shaped like that and consider it as one roti or just tear a whole roti into two. That just wasn't necessary as the 2 rotis were very good and and so were the other components of the meal. Everything tasted great. But the portion of rice was laughably little; it was literally a handful and they should give a little more for the price. (Update: They now give out 4 whole normal rotis and a good enough quantity of rice.)"
Worst place they have taken 1 hr for one pizza very slow served when we said to waiter he sad it happen he was very rude will never go to this place
I've seen this restaurant from Day 1 when it was opened and I've seen it grow quite fast. The owners of this restaurant are very friendly and the food is also quite good. No wonder it has grown so much!!!!
"Very good Restaurant to arrange b'day party celebration .I have celebrated my daughter birthday today .It was a wonderfull experience with full of tasty food and excellent service by staff.Special thanks to Restaurant owner to extend full co-operation to made our experience awesome.

"Absolutely loved this place. Its located near Shilp Chowk, Kharghar. It is a pure veg restaurant. The food is delicious. We ordered an unlimited veg thali. The service was nice. Will definately visit again."
Poor quality food..i didn't like it..also I have ordered two special thali but they give only 3 chapatis..not satisfy. No taste..rice also not good...
"Save your time visit some place waited almost 1 hour .. everyone was waiting even water was delayed..
So kindly choose only if you have time"
Nice place. Good ambiance and nice food. Staff is also good. Overall nice experience. We had ordered for kofta curry which was nice. Lemon corriander soup was quite sour. N yeah. The water they serve had a nice taste.
"Good food , pleasant ambience sunday special dal batti n churma is worth tasting .Humble staff
Good place for family dinners and childfriendly environment.üëç"
I don't know what went wrong with them. Being a vegetarian restaurant v chose to give it a try n the staff here also was too friendly. They were taking care of the kids but the food we ordered was not turned out to be the same as v wanted. The taste was totally different and after the first visit only after eating their food everyone in our family got stomach ache n upset tummy which is very unusual . although the presentation was very good I think v should be given a chance to visit their kitchen then only I would be able to visit their place.
"Visited the place on weekday (Janmashtami) and just 2 families were sitting..
Had a lot of comedy for giving orders to the servers as they took every order differently besides Manchurian Soup..
Ordered bajra roti it came as normal roti
Ordered Veg Koliwada it came as Paneer Koliwada
Ordered fresh lime juice server almost bought fresh lime soda..
Not sure where was the gap..
Place is spacious and clean food taste wasn't bad either ..
Typical Fine Dine to have a veg food
Please check the order before the server finalizes it .."
"One of the best place for pure vegetarians.. Must visit place...
Ambience - 4/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Ordered veg crispy, paneer pahadi tikka in starters... Followed by veg koliwada, paneer kadai in main course.
Taste was too good.. Loved it.."
"Anukul is all time hit Indian cuisine menu restaurant with good food quality, I been there once for diner.
Nice place with good taste for regular Indian cuisine"
My go-to place in kharghar to order typical north Indian vegetarian food . Paneer makhanawala and dal khichdi are must to order for . Shall definitely visit the place for dining experience . Their starters are worth trying too . Overall good place for quick dining solutions
I regret not visiting this place in past it one of the best restaurants in the locality extremely cooperating staff and well mannered too the food was great...and so was the detox water that they keep serving throughout... Kuddos to the management staff highly impressed and recommended......ps we took the cake ourself but the staff insisted and brought it decorated in such a beautiful manner best place to throw party
the food is very gud.....simply loved it
"I had ordered pav Bhaji and lassi.Though they were quick on service but I would appreciate if they had made it tastier. the food was average and needs improvement. lassi too was okay, nothing special about it. 4 start for delivery and 3 star for food."
"I heard about Anukul from my friends, my wife and I decided to visit this place. I generally don't prefer to have veg when I go out, but then thought nothing wrong in trying. Being a pure veg restaurant, my expectations were high for veg starters. Since it was our first time didn't want to experiment much, so we ordered paneer chilli and 2 veg thalis. The starter was not up to the mark. The veg sabji's were also tasteless. The ambiance was good, the staff was very warm and welcoming. They can definitely improve on the taste."
"Got to know about this restaurant from Zomato. Me n my friends went there for dinner a day back and were really impressed by the food taste. Delicious food, apt service and the most important for me pure VEG restaurant. Though the prices are a bit high but then it‚Äôs balanced by their food. Will surely visit again . The only drawback that we felt was the party hall right in front of the table space and the loud sound that disturbs the experience."
ordered veg biryani was good
Delicious food and delivered before time. Dal was awesome.
good food.
they served moong dal in dal fry instead of toor (arhar) dal
Delicious food. On time delivery
My favourite place in Navi Mumbai to have Vegetarian food. Love your Palak Pata and tokri chat. Welcome drinks were amazing. Favourite dish- Paneer Lazeez with Garlic Kulch. Amazing delicacies!
Pav bhaji here is amazing the best pav bhaji u can have in kharghar is here . Best restaurant for a vegetarian in kharghar . If you are veggie and foodie give a try at this place!
"Good people with food... realized they my have had some issue in the food delivered yesterday.

Provided complimentry machurian dish with their best quality cooks.

Hotel denied for delivery
"We ordered food from anukul, it was not at all testy and quality. Instead of Manchurian they delivered Gobi Manchurian..that too not cooked properly.

Disppointed with food quality."

"One of my sister‚Äôs friends took us to this place as she had her kitty party a few weeks ago and recommended to try the place. We had kids with us so we had to consider the options for them too. Its a late post, so i have forgotten the names of the dishes we ordered.

We were welcomed with delicious pink lemonade.
Our order:
Palak Pata Chaat - MUST TRY!!!!
Pizza
Stuffed Garlic Bread
Pasta

Everything was super delicious. Staff was good. But only thing which disappointed me was the service. It was tad slow.

Kids enjoyed the food. Hence we could enjoy the food in peace. Everything was tasty. I would recommend this place to everyone out there for a try!"
"bhaji too much salty.

other food ok but comparatively expensive.
Will appreciate if concerned restaurant does not ping my number with promotional messages every now and then.

Overall good option for veggiesüëç."
"Very worst service ever seen in any restaurant, very much slow service, I will suggest not to visit this restaurant it's personal Experience, very much slow service.....please don't visit."
"Good place , decent ambience. north Indian and Chinese is good.. Value for money.. friendly staff.. prompt service.. Good for family and friends get together .."
"It's okay. They put a lot of garlic in lasooni methi but they dal bhati was fine
Hope next time then serve me with better food.
There's always a room for improvement"
"One of the good Pure Veg Restaurant that I have visited.
The ambience and decor is calm and peaceful. Appropriate for family visits.
Ample seating space.
Range of cuisines served by them.
Started with Alfredo Pasta. Pasta wasn't too overcooked or undercooked. Spicy and tasty enough.
Then we jumped to Punjabi Dishes.
Veg Kolhapuri was according to its name. Spicy and full of Vegetables.
Do try their masala chaas."
Ordered Special Thali. Food quality was very good and qty also.
food was tasty n got on time
"I have ordered paneer tava, the taste was nice but there was more paneer than the masala. I want that on paneer tava u should have equal proportion of paneer and the veggies. And also the service was quick. Thanks for the food and quick service."
Food was server hot and taste wise it was quite good. One of the best food i had in kharghar.
"Anukul Restaurant is located on 2nd floor at one of the prime location in kharghar. The place is having ample seating arrangement with a good view from the top. It is a good place to have small parties and celebrations. The satff and Management are very helpful and friendly.
Now coming to the food, I have visited this restaurant quite a lot time. The quantity and quality of the food served was very good. I specifically like their veg thali, which has a good combination of all the items. I also had ordered food from the restaurant many times. The food was delivered with in the given time. The restaurant is not too heavy on the pocket. It is one of the best option for having vegetarian food...read more"
"Good food. Friendly staff.
Alu tikki chat is one of the best in the area.
Must try. Also they have interesting offers in the menu. Nice place for veg lovers."
less quantity
Superb food at reasonable price
taste was worst. daal batti is not like this...
Awesome Food. TOTALLY worth it.
Their Dal Bati Churma was real good. Bati was so soft that I could not believe it. Churma was equally tasty. I wish I had some more churma but you cant expect more than that in 150. The only thing is that they didnt send lemon with the whole package and the dal was a little less spicy. Dal should be a bit more spicy when taken with Bati. Other than that it was too good to be true at this small price.
Food Quality and quantity was good.
Must try.. Good quality.
Amazing food.. Loved the taste.. Quantity is very good.. Service is awesome.. Totally loved the infused water they serve.. Overall an amazing experience :)
"Bird's nest, palak patta Chaat both were awesome.
Ambience was relaxing. I visited when they had a candle light Wednesday theme going on. It was a pleasant experience. Friendly staff, hygienic place. Pocket friendly. Definitely a place Worth visiting."
Chapatis were chewy and cold. The chholes were undercooked as can be felt when eaten. The restaurant needs to work on cooking rather than just putting vegetables in a gravy and finishing it up.
