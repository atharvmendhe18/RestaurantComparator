Review
we had Maggie sizzler which they recommended. the taste was amazing
We had ordered cheese peri peri maggie. It was surprisingly delicious and the quantity was also great. Ambience is pleasant and the service was also quick. Must try place for a maggie lover.
the fries are crispy..maggi has good texture..
Amazing foodüòç
amazing pasta. must try
Amazing food and quality of food is good
We ordered Jain Hakka Maggi and Jain Shashlik sauce sizzler Maggie. The service was quick. The Hakka Maggie had perfect taste of Indo Chinese as mentioned. The sizzler was also decent but could have provided Shashlik sauce extra on the side.
Tried the Alfredo maggi which was cheesy with exotic veggies. The ambiance is cozy with AC and non AC seating area. Would recommend it.
Oye Punjabi Maggiza was very bad. Rest all good.

2) French fries with dips were also amazing

"WORST PLACE YOU COULD EVER GO IN MAHAVIR NAGAR!

I visited this place for the first time as I saw them on Shark Tank and I really loved their concept. But it turned out into a disaster.

I visited the restaurant with the friends and I was welcomed with a strong attitude by the server. Me and my friends settled ourselves on a table and within a min or two we were asked to leave the table. On asking, we were said that a family of 4 was waiting before us but we didn't see anyone waiting (maybe biased towards their regular customers). After sometime, we got a table and server asked us to sit inside (AC compartment). We settled ourselves and again the same family of 4 came behind us and server...read more"
Amazing food and service
very innovative food ideas. definitely worth the visit
absolutely wonderful place to hangout
"an absolutely wonderful place to try delicious items
we tried the classic blooming bread(aglio E Olio) along with chilli cheese fries and paneer Manchurian rice which is a must try.
for beverages we had spicy guava mojito and green apple which were too good, no over sugary nonsense."
"Picadli Maggi - Must Try
Peri Peri Magizza Must Try
Cozy Outlet with amazing food"
good place to try something different made from Maggie.. just loved it
Very nice food and Good ambience
The tadka Maggie was amazing and the fries were also very tasty. Highly recommend mojito and iced tea
The Pizza and Peach Ice tea are out of this world. Highly recommend this Cafe for anyone wanting to try something Uncanny!! 10/10
"Had been there, had oriental blooming bread which was too good.... pink pasta is also decent, qty sufficient for 2. will recommend and visit again"
Great food and service
We tried sizzler and it was yummy.... recommended üëç
Cheesy Picante sizzler is a must try! Even the Magburg is amazing!
a very unique idea where maggi is used in different ways to make tasty dishes. Jain options are available so that makes it even more better
had ordered chilli garlic maggie bowl and it was simply amazing üòç
"80+ maggi dishes, if you ever want to try some fusion food you should definitely visit this place also I have made a review video about this place do check on YouTube :- HEPERFECT FOOD VLOGGER"
"Superb taste .. lovely food

Worth value , nice music inside section , nice crowd"
I would love to explore this place again and again... First i explored it when it was in ghatkopar.. love the place ... Ambience and services too..
Do try their variety of maggies!
Loved their Hakka Maggi & Yuzu mocktail
Food is good. Service is also ok. The variety of food is just fabulous üòç. Seating arrangement can be made better because the height of the food table and seating table is too much. Tables shake while eating.
Food was excellent and affordable.
Been there..ordered peri peri magburg..there was no sauce and the burger was without cheese (when did the burger started coming without cheese)..on asking to add cheese slice in the burger..for ONE slice of cheese they charge 30rs..I mean seriously 30rs for one slice..overall it's an avoid for me @hungryheadind
