"Very Cozy clean place, . Food is delicious. Esp recommended is Tangdi Kabab. Portions are adequate, prices are reasonable. Kenny Gandhi the owner takes personal attention to customers! Would definitely visit again"
"A small place but beautiful restaurant. A wallet friendly place with really good quality food. Whenever possible, do try any of the dishes from the 'mini thali', I have tried a few from the veg variety and were good. The sarso ka saag and makai ki roti is wonderful, so is the chole bhature. Only thing, the place need better ventilation."
"Great food. Specially punjabi dishes. They have good ambience and fresh food served.
They are not much famous but they actually have good food and is pocket friendly too."
"This rating is purely in comparison of north indian food served in Mumbai.

A good north indian restaurant in mumbai. For people craving for north food. This place will do a fairly good job in killing your cravings.

The only issue is that prices are a little on higher side compared with the taste of food. The portions are filling.

Stuffed naan is a must try here.

Would definitely order food from here again.

Cheers!"
"Date : 8th Aug 2015 @ 8.30 PM

Decided to order food from here as was too bored to go to any place and wait in a queue for a table as was a Sat evening.

Ordered some basic stuff 
- Navratna Kurma : which was ok 
- Nan/Roti : The Nan was better than the Roti
- Gulab Jamuns : Pretty delicious - hot and soft on the bite

Overall an ok place to visit or order a takeaway. Did not find anything special that needs a mention.

The pricing is inline with the taste so no reason to crib :)"
"Aroma looked like a quaint little place and we thought it would be worth trying it out. I had called the restaurant specifically before leaving from home and checked for the availability of valet parking to which I had got an affirmative response. Upon reaching they mentioned that the valet hadn't turned up for the day and I would have to look for a parking spot by myself. This was just the beginning of the disappointment. The food quality was average in terms of preparation, looks and taste,  though the portions served were good. The service was prompt. The finger bowl given at the end had extremely hot water. Overall, would't like to visit it again."
"Aroma is an excellent hidden gem for budget places around Mahim. It is right next to Di Bella Coffee and situated well within walking distances of Mahim Church, China Bistro, Dadar Shivaji Park and as a drivable straight destination from Prabha Devi. This makes the location definitely attractive. The food is served in right proportions and the staff is extremely courteous. I love both of it but the facet that won me over was the fact that the place was clean and the service was quick. I sincerely thank the management of Aroma for addressing all concerns with regards to a time-sensitive customer. So, if you are looking for a quick value-add Punjabi / Chinese meal - you have come to the...read more"
"Do agree with the reviews that the area needed a good place to eat and Aroma is indeed the answer... It is the Food Place!!!!!.. A perfect place to satisfy the taste buds.......

The staff was as welcoming as they were when we visited the first time...

The place is clean and organised..... The carefully infused blue and white in the interiors makes your mood bright....... Speaking about attention to detail.... The stripped blue napkins do need a special mention.....

We ordered paneer tikka (parceled), chole bhatura (mini meal), korma (mini meal) for the herbivores, chicken fried rice and chilli chicken (mini meal) for the carnivorous me and each of it was worth every penny...read more"
Nice ambience.... nice people......food delicious ... had chicken tandoor and chicken biryani...... calm place to spend an evening wid ur loved ones..
"Really good chicken tangdi kababs & chicken tikka masala. Not to much oil & colour. Home style north Indian food. In veg, the stuffed capsicum & pakoda curry was top quality. We ordered from here - delivery was quick. Will definitely order again...."
"A relatively new place in the Mahim area, Aroma serves a mix of Indian and Chinese food. Ordered for the chicken tikka chilly, tangdi kebab, masala papad, reshmi tikka masala, and Indian breads. The tangdi kebab was the best of the lot and would totally recommend it. The chicken tikka chilly was decent (basically chicken tikka tossed around in chilly). The total came up to Rs. 1500 for the four of us. They also do chicken, Mutton, fish and veg thalis for Lunch. All in all, a good place for lunch if you are around the Mahim area and want to try something new."
"Went for a quick lunch. Service was quick, maybe due to lack of customers at that given time. Chicken was very well marinated and was fresh. Overall good starters and main course. Deserts are overpriced given the quantity that they serve. Overall a place to get good food."
Iv order a few vegetables for home delivery from Aroma and I was not impressed with the taste of the food. I had ordered for Dum Aloo Punjabi from here and what I received was not even close to Dum Aloo you get elsewhere. The gravy seemed to be ready to eat type mixture mixed with a few cut boiled potato pieces.
Awesome food. Great service. The biryanis and the kebabs are excellent. The only problem with this place is to find car parking. Would surely recommend this place for Punjabi Food.
Lovely authentic indian food????..........Good service........Delivery on time........In short a good experience on the whole...............
"After a long delay finally had lunch over here. Good starters and best place for lunch near Hinduja, Mahim. Friendly staff. Nice ambience. Just need to add better music to play."
"Pathetic food and pathetic drinks. Had paneer bhurji which had no taste. Had cheese balls which were to be frank,quite big and oily. Had malai paneer tikka which tasted like raw paneer. Really bad experience."
"A pleasant place to dine but a little congested, will try to land here again cause the food is up to the mark, service is a little slow but overall experience is satisfactory"
Really enjoy the food here. The chicken tikka chili is particularly good. So is the Kheema. We order quite regularly from here and glad to say they never disappoint. Service is very prompt and the best part is they are very reasonably priced.
"Writing this after my second visit to the joint. Went back coz of the amazing dal makhani I had the first time round. I had ordered their dum aloo in he first visit. Both dishes made up the perfect home cooked meal.
Alas! My expctaions were dashed. This time the dal makhani seemed just like masoor ki dal. The smoked flavour which is essential was lacking, and there was no makhan either. Next, the veg khurma was just vegetables cooked in hurriedly added garam masala. I'm not going to this joint in a hurry. The service is great, the staff courteous, but they really need to be consistent in the taste."
"I think you will agree with me when I say that good food can only be made with passion, and the owner is full of it.

I have been here 3 times and have called for delivery as well. Every time I have tried a different dish, some of them are Afghan Chicken, Paneer Tikka, Aalo Tandoori, Sheekh Kebab in starters, Veg. Keema (Must Try) and Chicken Biryani (a little different from mainstream Biryani, nevertheless, Must Try!!!) in the main course. I admit that I have not gone through most of the menu but I have really enjoyed the dishes I have had until now. The food is well cooked and well spiced and also very tasty.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very well thought of, not too bright and...read more"
A new place to visit in this area. Ambience is good. Quantity and quality are decent. I did not understand on what basis have they calculated the price for food. Like a veg platter for 300 Rs whereas a cheese garlic naan for 150 Rs.
"Amazing food, great taste and a fantastuc menu!! For all taste buds... Have ordered home delivery and very happy with it.. Must go and must order!!!!"
"For all the lovers of quintessential punjabi food, aroma is the place to visit. I don't review much but when a food actually has a positive impact on me then only i review. So I have tried Dal Makhani, Rajma Chawal, Aloo Prauntha from this place and i've to say that the quality is topnotch. I am ordering these items on regular basis and the taste has remained constant. Being a hardcore punjabi born and brought up in typical Punjabi areas, i was looking for some food places where i could feel the taste of punjab....!! Aroma has been a pleasant surprise. !! Try Dal Makhani, Rajma Chawal right away..!!!"
"Aroma has come up where Smokin Joes once was at Cadell Road, smack opposite Yes Bank. The area is in dire need of good restaurants so I was keen to try this place out. I've been here twice and have already experienced both delight and despair. For the first time we dropped in we tried the shammi kebab, chicken pahadi kebab, chicken masala and a veg American Chopsuey. The shammi kebabs were tasty and fragile as they should be, the pahadi kebabs were tender and zesty, the chicken masala was above average and the Chopsuey average. Enthused by our first experience, the following week we asked for a home delivery of chana masala and dal makhni (the basic dishes any self respecting...read more"
