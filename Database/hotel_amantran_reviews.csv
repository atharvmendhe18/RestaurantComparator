Review
I eat 1 misal in hotel and taken two misal as a parcel.At home when I open it.. it include only misal no farsan packet and no batata bhaji ..it have only misal rasa bhaji and chopped onion that's it..
"Took parcel from hotel. Discovered at home that quantity was very less. Ordered for 8 people, hardly 6 people could eat. Never ordering/dining at Amantran henceforth."
This place is specially known for Vada Sambhar And so many dishes. This place is crowded as it is best for it's service.

"""Amantran"", which means invitation. The restaurant invites you to come at their place and have some scrumptious food. The famous dish here is ""misal pav"" and it tastes delicious, also one can order other food items like idli, dosa, vada, etc. This place is fantastically immaculate and the service givers are good to talk to and also at the same time they are on their toes. The ambience is quite good. This place is very near to the station and one can easily think of getting down and spend some time and money at this place to eat flavoursome food. Apart from all this, this restaurant is pocket friendly so one can consider it as cherry on the cake. I request you all to...read more"

"As much as I liked the misal from here, I did feel that it was over-priced.
However, for small appetite people like me, I can share the misal with someone with some extra pav.
Another reason that I can never finish the entire thing at once is that it's too spicy.
So be careful with this one!
I have not tried any other dishes here so I won't be able to comment.

The place is decent and always crowded.
There are unusual delays at times in serving the order.

But for once, amantran misal is a must try!"

I visited to have their speciality which Misal Pav and it was really good. I am too ofter to this place for their speciality. Over all very place in terms of ambieance but they really serve good and hygenic food. Place is clean and neatly maintained. I highly recommend this place.
"One of the famous place for misal pav. One should try such misal pav. They offer medium spicy and spicy misal which has a unique taste and aroma. However they charge Rs.60/plate which is too much and they also charge Rs.10 for extra pav and Rs.30 for extra rassa (gravy) which should be free of cost. I also tried butter milk (chaas) which also a good digester after such heavy misal.
Overall good place.
Ambience is also good.
Sometimes in the afternoon time rush is their but waiting time is approximately 10-15 min.
Highly recommended place"
Misal here is the best. Have so many memories with this place.
I ordered misal pav at home. Misal is tasty and spicy.but the green peas was not cooked properly. Otherwise misal is nice
""
"Ambience is great along with staff being too caring and supportive. Special item was misal pav. A place to be cherished, place is good supported by quality too."
There were no pulses in the misal. I ordered 3 misals. Only gravy without any pulses. Also Flavourless. OVERHYPED.
"This restaurant is located in nandupada,thane west. This place has a pretty long menu. It provides a lot of different dishes"

"whenever you are in thane west,you should surely visit the hotel amantran.Amantran misal is one famous fast food in thane by its name.As its name,it is really tasty.The seating is also good and at the first floor.staff is quite good.I have also tried milkshake..but it is not worth the money."
Had tried pulao and korma and few other Indian dishes. Taste was great .

Good food at reasonable rate
It's was really a great experience for me. Loved Misal Pav. So yummy and tasty. Worth place for breakfast. Ambience is good. Staff are so polite. Not much crowded. Cute little tables which I loved moreüòç Great experience! üíñ
Very famous for its misal pav which tastes similar to mamledar misal. I have been to this place many times to have misal pav and it never disappoints me. Misal pav is spicy however while ordering you can alway suggest the server if you want it less spicy. One can try their South Indian food as well but misal pav is something you should not miss!!
"Excellent food, especially the misal
It was the great experience there , I enjoyed alot
I will surely recommend this place to my friends , family and my relatives

Hands down the best place for misaal.
I always order from this place it is very famous for misal pav best misal pav u can ever eat I love this place also thali are available with many north Indian menu
"The misal was so spicy and tasty.
It was too good and tasty.
The services with us was also very good."
Great place with amazing ambience. The food items are also amazing. Tried with their famous misal which was similiar to Mamledar Misal only but was too good. It was spicy but amazing in taste. Loved it. The staff were cooperative too. Good place to visit.
"As far as misal taste is concerned...it is indeed awesome! Food quality and quantity is good. Staff is bit ignorent.
One gentle request to restaurant...please add option of adding extra pav (more than 1) and curry along with misal while ordering online."
"This is located in thane west,and near to thane stion.this is fantastic hotel in thane.this is famous for misal pav. And it misal pav is very very testy and delicious."
"Had tried Missal Pav , Butter Milk & Dinkache Ladoo from Amantran . Everything was good in taste . One thing I liked about Amantran is comfortable sitting , unlike the related restaurant Mamledaar . Price is genuine . You may have to wait in queue . Service is good ."
"Nice ,over all we had a best experience ,the main part is the service every one were attention ,sure will visit again thanks to make our day full fill ."
One of the oldest and best restaurants in Thane city. The taste is fantastic. If any restaurant has the best misal pav in Thane then its Amantran's misal pav. Though almost the food items have very good taste
"Ambience is not great as such but missel pav is good in taste.
You should ignore Ambience but try missel here its better than other hyped missel outlets in thane."

"You dont wana die without having their missal pav ü§£ must try... butter milk is a must with missal pav


Ignore the ambience.. go for food.!!!

Non-ac restaurant... fast service ... amazing missal"
This is the place where you'll find the most spicy misal paw in thane and also most delicious one... Its ambience are not that good ... Service is fine ... Famous for its misal paw... Good place for quick hunger near station at cheap range..
"EAT WITH CAUTION!!!

One of the place where you can have really SPICY MISAL.

Amantran is like a plush child of THE MAMLEDAAR MISAL. It gives you really awesome and spicy Misal.
The only problem is it has extremely large amount of oil (in spicy variant).

Vada USAL is also not bad.

The mango milkshake was not that great. Cold coffee was very watery.

The price range is fair enough. They just need to give us fast service for stuff other than Misal. Also I expect more of cleanliness.

But Amantran is not a bad option for getting a quick and cheap meal in Thane station area if you don't like momos and Wraps."
"Let me start by clarifying my bias - as a Marathi 'jaminicha putr"" (son of the soil) and a born-and-brought-up Thanekar, I have been eating at Maledar Misal and then Amantran for a really long time. It was a nice place for a really long time to have that spicy misal breakfast with a cold drink and get on with your day. However, all good things must come to an end and so it seems with Amantran.On the fateful morning, my wife decided that there would be no breakfast cooked at home - which meant I drove up to the Amantran takeout counter to collect 6 misal pavs for my extended family. I was excited to be having this after a while, but what followed when I opened the packets was a total...read more"
"I had never tasted Misal pav like this. Just superb taste, They provides misal pav in 2 varients spicy and midium spicy.. My favourite is just spicy which tempt me alot to have at any time. The Butter milk was also just superb."
It's was one of the best Thali in Thane. Food was good and cooked well.basundi and gulab jamun was just one of the best one. Plzz visit at least once in ur life time‚ù§
"Actually This Place Easy Noticeable From Thane Talavpali This Place Is Quielty Famous For its Fast Food And Its Quality.
Visited Here With My Friends Eat Here The MISAL PAV. Totally Loved The Quality n Quantity Of The Misal . If You Want Spicy They Will Provide you spicy Misal Also.
This place Is Absolutely a huger A Ki bajao Place
This place Is always queued. This Place loved my by many customers. Loved This Place"
"Its is popularly known as The Misal Pav station. You will always see a queue in waiting for seating. Coming to the food we have order two types of misal pav,  medium and spicy Misal pav. Both were great in terms of everything. The uniqueness we found is that there was an amazing taste of all the spices and it also contained nice addition of the twist of spiciness and tangyness in the Misal which was really good in taste and was good in flavour. I suggest everyone to visit this place you will definitely like this place. As I‚Äôm also planning to visit once again. Thank you."
"famous for all over Maharashtra dishes such as missal in veg, even best vadde and kombdi ch rassa and most decilious and sweet karvas is best"
"It's a pure vegetarian restaurant located near by Talao pali lake. This hotel is popular for their Maharashtrian dishes. It's always crowded in afternoon lunch time & dinner time. All the tables are full even I see that customer standing out side of the hotel for their turn. I tried the Misal pav, lunch Thali & lassi. All the dishes are delicious and value for money. I give. Three star for delicious food and reasonable price and minus -2 star due to Rude behavior of manager. He does not have the manners to talk with customer. Manners less managers & staff."
"I have been to this place a no of times for the world famous Mamledar Misal!
But this misal never stood up to my expectations.
I have had very high expectations for the place when I tried the misal for the very first time.
The misal does taste good but nothing so extraordinary about it. They put a lot of Farsan to the misal and that somehow doesn't turn up good.
One can order for Low/Medium/Extra Spicy Misal according to their convenience.
I have always tried the Extra Spicy one but never really felt that much of spiciness which they describe.
I honestly consider this place to be one of the most overhyped places in Thane and now over the years, the quality has been degraded a lot. Also...read more"
From childhood i am visiting this place and since that time the food tastes same. It is my favorite restaurant whenever i go to thane i have to go there.
"One of the lip smacking dish in a maharashtrian cuisine is the misal Pav. And the mamledar misal of thane is legendary. This is served in their restaurant called amantran. A small over crowded place , with some waiting time in peak hours. The crowds throng mainly to eat the misal Pav, but they have umpteen dishes on the menu. But the star item is the misal Pav, the taste of which lingers long after you leave the restaurant. Well the misal comes in three choices, light, medium, and theeka. The medium one itself has lots of fire in it, so you you can imagine how the theeka will be. Go for it if you can stomach that. I went with the medium one. Simply marvellous. Check out the pic to see the...read more"
"A quite decent ambience situated on 1st floor near the famous talao pali lake of thane
Famous fr its misal pav and also has a must try dish called ""Kharvas"" ."
No place is better than this when it comes to lip smacking spicy misal pav. It's unique taste and quick service is unbeatable. But with spicy misal cheese pakoda with green chutney is fabulous. And buttermilk at end complety satisfies your tummy
"Good service, Great Food!
Had the most famous item on their menu, which a lot of people flock this restaurant for, The Misal Pav (Rs. 58 + Rs. 3 for an extra pav) was very satisfied.
One can choose between 3 spice levels - Mild, Medium and Spicy and if you have sensitive taste buds, I suggest going for the medium/mild itself.
Will be back to try the other food they offer soon!
Folks in Thane and elsewhere, pay this place a visit if you like a good misal pav!"
"Visted this place yesterday. It is usually crowed between 8-9.30. The food here is just wow. Loved tawa paneer. Also the service was great and quick.
Best hotel the area."
"Been there quit a lot of times, just for eating ""Misal Pav""

Yes, it's the only speciality here! You can also try Dahi Misal Pav and other South Indian dishes it may offer."
Best place in Mumbai to have misal pav. The service is also excellent and so neat and clean place. Must try butter milk here which is also too good.
"It is simply located near talaopali .Yesterday I visited here with my family..hotel amantran provide various types of dishes but they are famous for misal pav,so I suggest if you want to test a good quality of misal must visit here.

Cost:- 4/5
Quality:-5/5

Ambience:-3/5

This place has always been my go to place whenever I crave for misal pav and some maharashtrain signature dishes. I have been visiting this place since childhood and the service here is excellent with delicious mouth watering food items. Mind you it is always crowded as it's the famous place people are always standing in the waiting line but it's worth the wait. If you are street shopping at thane station market and you think of taking a snack break do visit this place as it's the closest the market area and talav Pali. You will surely enjoy the food and ambience here.
Outlet is OK in terms of cleanliness but missel is amazing in terms of taste one of the best in thane for sure as my taste bud. Service is OK.
"Amantran
What we ate - Misal pav
The hues remain constant every time Anna visits this place. Not very spicy and also not very bland. The place serves some amazing food stuff. Although Known specifically for Misal pav, one should even try puri bhaji or thaali.
Prompt service, probably takes 5 minutes to serve what you have ordered for. Economical."
Located in thane this place is famous for spicy missal. Which is very famous in thane. Place looks nice and family friendly. Not so much in to cleanliness but you can grab a quick bite here. Other menu also available but must try missal . Been here so many times and it never disappointed me.
When you love Mamledaar misal but search for a better place to sit.. Amantran is you spot.. Been here since childhood.. The taste and ambience still remains same.. Try their kharvas aa well.
Too hot ad spicey combination of misal is bing here l love to eat this misal coz i love spice dises ad we love to go their again as again üòãüòãüòã
"This is one amongst the old and famous hotels in Thane city.
Mamledar and Amatran they are the same, but this shop is locate just beside the Mamledar shop.. It's well built and a modern type.
The Misal is all time best and nice place to sit with your friends and spend time.
Ambience is not that good, cleanliness also should be kept well.
Misal Pav, Tak, Lassi is what everyone likes to have here in majority. You can also get rest of the food from the menu if you want, but people here mostly visit for the Misal itself."
"I have been here several times. The service is pathetic, no-one comes to take order.
This place is famous for misal pav and they serve the best misal pav in Mumbai. Must try!"
"Had heard of it from many,comparing it to Mamledar.
Tried their Misal Pav, Buttermilk & Kharwas. All was great & enjoyed the food thoroughly.
Staff is Good & service is also quick. Has simple ambience. Have to wait for getting seat.

Taste & service is as good as Mamledar.

Both are great in their own way.

Shashank Jain (VEGHUNT)"
One of the authentic Mamledar misal of Thane. The best in town. Had a lighter version but was still spicy. Need to have chaas along with this. The Misal pav is fantastic.
"Went here to check out their amazing missal as said by everyone and yes, I do agree. Missal is great and is served with farsan and onion on top of it. I didn't like the buttermilk here though. Ambience is not bad and service is quick. The food is economical here and this place has a table sharing system."
"Now, I have tried the famous misal pav this place offers and it is really good. But this time, I am reviewing it overall as a hotel.

Ambience (3/5) :- A decent place, nothing extraordinary about the interiors but altogether it is clean.

Service and staff (4/5) :- Very quick service and a polite staff.

Food :-

1. Paneer Ludhiana (3/5) :- Coated and fried paneer pieces with a gravy. The paneer was a bit chewy, and the gravy a tad bit salty.

2. Butter roti (4/5) :- A proper sized roti which was decently cooked.

3. Masala chaas (3/5) :- Was way too much salty and could be more quantity wise as well.

Overall, this place mostly is a heaven for all the misal pav lovers no doubt, but not...read more"
One of the best misal i had till now is from Amantran hotel. Taste too good. I like especially spicy misal. From 13 years visiting Amantran Service taste same -No change. Superb n mouth watering misal. Everyone Must try.
"A go to place for a quick snack, not for a full fledged lunch. Perfectly known for its Misal Pav. Staff is polite and quick. Would rate 5/5 for Misal Pav, chaas and kharvas. This is an economical place which can definitely fill your belly within 60-70 bucks."
"This is probably the best place to go out and have MISAL PAV, this is specially famous for this and other dishes are average.
Misal is available in different degrees of spicyness /hotness.
The best combination is to order a medium misal originally and then order extra rasa vatti which is max theeka (hot). Along with this a glass of buttermilk makes this a Amazing meal out there"
"Visiting this restaurant for 20 years and always have been ordering misal. They serve delicious misal. It is usually spicy so one has to tell them how much spicy misal they want. Misal is made of mashed potato layer at the bottom, topped with sprouts and katt (rassa), farsan and onion. This spicy dish is served with lemon wedges and 2 pavs. After having misal one has to order a glass of buttermilk too."
"This place is located just 5 min walking distance from thane station ..if you wanna experience aunthentic maharashtrain cuisine then dis is the place you are looking for ..
We ordered misal which is their speciality(5/5)
Misal was served with mashed potato sabji poured with misal gravy and sprouts....topped with farshan onions and lemon....this was just perfect..best misal i have had till date

Deluxe thali (5/5)
It consisted of a lot of things...2 paneer sabji..dal ..kadi..puri...aachar..pulav...fruit salad...gulab jamun...papad and patra..this was a royal meal in itself.

"They serve Good Thalis. I won's say that their thalis tastes the best, but they are good enough to satisfy your hunger. Prices are not much expensive, food is good! Pulav in Thali with pulav tastes very nice!"
This place is famous for its Misal Pav which is an authentic maharahtrian dish. I have been hearing a lot about this place so today I was in Thane and thought of giving this a try. It takes a 10 min walk from Thane station. During meal time you got to wait in a huge queue mannnn... The ambience here is quite good with a fast service. Well coming on to food I ordered Misal pav and chaas I ordered a medium spicy misal you can order it according to your taste. The order came in no time . Talking about the taste I did not like it much . The hotel has many more veg options other than Misal pav.
"Visited this place with family. Ordered thali dinner.
Prompt service. The thali has 3 bhaji, dal, dahi kadi, papad and pickle. They either serve puri or roti, pulav or plain rice. They also serve a sweet dish like gulab jamun and fruit salad."
Famous for Misal Pav specially Service is not as good as well bit food quality is very tasty and delicious in this hotel there are very conjested seating arrangement that is why in morning time and evening time crowd is in the hotel and q will be created i have been eating today with my brother devdatta and my friend amey we eat misal pav and and 1 glass of lassiüëçFor misal pav you going always to this restaurant üëç
"Perfect place to satiate your craving for Maharashtrian food.. specially misal, thalipeeth and piyush.. Even they serve other cuisines.. but don't forget to have Maharashtrian Cuisine.."
"Mamledar Misal ‚ù§
Apart from that Punjabi Thali is highly recommended.
Also kharwas is servedüòâ
Great place to have Maharashtrian food ... ambience is not that cool"
"There is a reason why you will find only misal pav photo for amantran in zomato. Because it is world famous for it's theekha misal. Not a big fan of spicy food? You can always have dahi misal. I always go for a dahi misal with chaas om the side. It is truely a fantastic place for misal lovers. Many people have heard mamledaar is famous for misal. Make no mistake, amantran and mamledaar are the same. Mamledaar doesn't have space to sit, while amantran has.

Apart from misal, thaalipeeth, kharvas are the other famous dishes that are served in amantran."
