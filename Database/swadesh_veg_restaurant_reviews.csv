Just wondering if this restaurant doesn't give a bit of diced onions & less than a quarter of lemon along with rs 200 pav bhaji and whether there could be an option to pay extra for it

nice and good service
Average food. Can skip this place. They sent juice which had a very bitter taste seems it was stale.
