Food must b very good but a restaurant runs with hospitality along with it. Servers name SUNIL is not at all co operative n understanding. N he is arrogant. Got in an argumet over increasing the TV volume for a cricket match.

"Worst taste ,experience and waste of money.Charges are hight but no taste at all forget about quantity.Shree Prasad is way much better than Adarsh.You guys are just name that's it.Wish I had zero star to rate this place. Please do not try this place waste of money and big disappointment."
I have had the opportunity to dine here today and it was the best service that I have experienced in a long long time. Special thanks to David who made it worth our time at Adarsh.

very poor service. paid 367rs for small 4 piece chicken schezwan and it tastes poor. less quantity and quality. taste is zero. worst ever service. Zomato pls ban this restaurant
I ordered bombay duck and they delivered bombil fish fry. It seems that this restaurant is managed by people with duck brain. üòÄ
just put how many pcs will be given
""
They are charging more and playing on quantity when we book through Zomato.
package was totally opened and soup was spilled and dry noodles were soggy and tastes terrible
"Super seafood .. the crabs gassi , the neer dosa , the surmai shallow fry and the chicken Sukkha is all that I relished . Surely going back for more .
It‚Äôs fresh catch . Succulent juicy seafood . One piece of surmai was 500 plus taxes , rest all was worth the price
They even do home delivery Ina jiffy and the food is as fresh"

"An upmarket Bar & Restaurant.
Good to visit with friends. The non veg food is quite delicious. Decor is just okay.
The waiters are good & courteous
Like
place has basic ambience to eat
cleanliness is well maintained."
"Couldn't click pics as was too Hungry so hogged upon it.
This hotel is located in Chembur and is quite old.
Loved their chicken tandoori although we had ordered for chicken tandoor roast which comprises of tandoor gravy but they gave normal chicken tandoori although I have had their chicken tandoori roast earlier so can say it's amazing the tandoori itself was juicy and the chicken was tender and juicy and the tandoor masala was well soaked in by it. The rasam was made of coconut milk and and not a huge fan of that so didn't like it much the chicken sukka was curry leaves based and it could be good but I didn't like it much"

Not at all good in taste and also the chicken was not fresh!! Bad experience.. wont ever order any dish from this resto henceforth.!! Agreed with the previous bad ratings !
"Glasses for drinks not up to the mark. Beer glasses not available. Day manager very rude to customers. The fish curry we ordered, the fish was not washed at all and was smelling."
""
Not the best place for ambience. You can be left crammed for space and it can get noisy at peak hours... Not the best feeling at your own peak.
"Fabulous with the best food, taste and qualityüëåüèªtheir butter chicken is a must eat. Chicken reshmi kebab and adarsh special chicken biryaniüéâ"
"Average ambience, but the food‚Äôs exceptional in case you know what to order. Special mention Adarsh special biryani and Adarsh special chicken is definitely worth a try. Fair priced, good seating arrangement."
"Nice ambience , food was good , service was good. I was there with my friends . It was excellent to be there last Sunday . They provide very good service n food was tasty ."
I had asked for kanda bhaji and they billed me for veg pakoda..... And I know in every means what veg pakoda looks like when confronted I was scolded on and made to pay the bill... Will never order or go to this restaurant... Pathetic service
"I went for a quick lucnh here, with my parents today.
The reason we chose it was because it was in front of our eyes on the main road in Chembur.
We ordered -
Chicken Moghlai
Dal Makhani
Jeera Rice
Butter Naan
The Moghlai lacked salt, however we could eat it and it was decent. The Dal was pretty good, however didn't give ne the feel of a creamy dal makhani as it should."
"I feel nostalgic in this place.
I remember when I was in college I used to visit with my building , college school buddies for a drink and dinner
recently I visited this place after years
everything seems the same, ambience is decent, this is strictly a place to chill with your guy friends when you don't want to spend more and also drink more
food has always been great, right from the tandoori chicken to their special chicken junglee masala and prawns koloeada
as mentioned price is very reasonable and service is great and the best part is the don't allow smoking inside plus they have ventilation which is very good for non smokers
cheers to this amazing place"
If you really wanna enjoy the manglore style fish and chicken do visit Adarsh at Chembur...Don‚Äôt forget to try the clams Margmussalsm and the bombil fry üòãüòã.The staff there is polite and service is very quick
"1 of the best hotel for seafood lovers
ü¶Ä tandoori is nice
Shimpi is nice , pomfret pulimunchi with neer dosa
And many more things to try .
Service is good and quick."
"Adarsh is known as cheap & best restaurant in Chembur area especially for seafood. The place is conveniently located near Chembur Station ( east ) and they have upper AC floor named as Oceanic meant for family. However kitchen is being the same for both ground floor Adarsh section ( for country cousins...lol ) and upper floor Oceanic ( for sopheticated crowd ),  serving delicious food. 

We 3 freinds had big & crispy Mandeli fry, King fish tawa fry, Quiid chilly and Bombil fry in starters. Each dish was properly marinated and served to enjoy every bite of it.  

I strongly recommend Adarsh for fresh sea food feast with couple of drinks to enjoy...read more"
"Been here for 2 to 3 times.
Crowded place in night.
There is also terrace sitting.
Tandoori chicken.
Chicken masala.
Mutton masala.
Chicken gravy.
Must try dishes.
All the times I went is with my office friends for partying.
My experience is quite good.
And staff is very attentive.
Went here at night time.

"Try Tandoori chicken lollypop here...
Its awesome...
Such lovely place to hangout with friends..
Rahul Mohite
Food quality is better among other restaurant in that area"
"I would rate it lower if I could. Horrible service. Horrible food. I have ordered from this place 2-3 times, have been here twice and have given this place enough visit to be in a position to write this review.
Avoid this place thoroughly if you want some good food. If you vsisit this place, these guys will give you a horrible service. You will feel that they are doing you a favour by allowing you to sit at their restaurant."
Pathetic home delivery...first they said minimum order 550 i agreed and then after giving d order dellivery boy says i cannot deliver ...pathetic
"This place used to be male only drink out restaurant in the evenings. However, we managed ensure that women too get to enjoy the hospitality and excellent food at Adarsh.

This place brings us a lot of memories and nostalgia as we spent more time here than anywhere else in Chembur during our College days.

The fish fry is one of the best you can find in Mumbai. Don't forget to try their Bhatkal Biriyani and French fries with chilli powder.

The staff and cashier are super friendly."
Had packed Mutton Sukka from your place last night. Thank you for packing me over cooked meat. It was as soft as a softy ice cream. Horrible!
"STRICTLY FOR MEN! There are few places that you would prefer to go with some friends who enjoy drinks, loud noise and delicious Mangalorean food. ARB is one of those places.

It's really loud. People could use foul language and scream. If your date is fine with that, get in. If not leave it for the men.

The food here is outstanding if you like Mangalorean Cuisine. One needs 4 bottles of Coke or Sweet Lime Soda to digest the spice. Mangalore is known for its extensive usage of Red Chilli Powder. Having said that the food is marvellous.

We enjoyed the starters - Egg Pakoda, Chicken Tandoori, Kheema Naan and Masala Papad. Delicious!

The main course is a treat if you crave for authentic...read more"
"I did a takeaway last week. The place offers good food at reasonable price. I had ordered chicken patiala... quite spicy and sukha chicken.. too yummy and chicken tikka masala which also didnt disappoint me. The bhatkal biryani which was recommended by the waiter was very bland, no spice at all. Good to go, keep it up"
"One of the best places in Chembur to drink as well as have cheap seafood..The seafood over here is best when had in their trademark Mangalorean style..Few items i would recommend are Mutton Sukha, Teesariya, Crabs and prawns butter garlic. Another new item is the squid burnt garlic and squid butter garlic.Even their fish fry and Sukha Bombil are delicious..The booze is also reasonably priced...the highlight is the seafood that is very cheap and has good quantity..A must try for Seafood lovers !"
"Had done home delivery last night .. Ordered for Butter Naan, Neer Dosa , Pomfret Ghassi , Prawns butter pepper fry and butter chicken.. The delivery was quite fast..
The food was really tasty.. More than expected . Quantity of the butter chicken was quite a lot with good amount of chicken. Only issue I had was the rates are quite different from whats mentioned here.. Please do update it or make someone in your hotel know what is Zomato because when I asked about the difference in the rates shown here , the guy who picked up the call tells me in Hindi that this is Adarsh and not Tomato :P Unfortunately was too hungry and couldn't take any pictures."
"A good place for cheap alcohol and good non-vegetarian food. Here, you also have option to get a table on terrace which is really cool specially at night"
"I've lost count of the times i've been to this place & I don't even want to think about how many times I must have ordered a takeaway or home delivery. SUPER food & SUPERBLY reasonable prices make this Resto-Bar an Icon in the Chembur area in my opinion. Hard to miss as it is just alongside the main road & has a huge signboard displaying the name of the Restaurant. Egg fried rice, Chicken tikka, Adarsh spcl biriyani are my favourites here & those who haven't tried this restaurant must go for these dishes. For vegetarians I would recommend paneer palak & Malai kofta with butter garlic naan. In conclusion....... I'm speechless about the quality of this restaurant...read more"
"Feb 2015

A Grade II Bar catering to middle income residents of Chembur, it has been recently refurbished & with a wider menu on offer seems to portray a more dignified atmosphere to enter on. In the late 90s, this used to be a pure drinking post and I used to go here with my KG besties having Haywards beer and Chicken Sukka.

Even today 25 years later, on a day off from the politics and staff issues at work, I call my Bestie to give me company early evening. He as usual turns up for me driving from his Kurla office and reaches sharp by 1830. Adarsh's Mangalorean dishes are more preferred, the chicken Sukka is good, better than JAI Prakash in Goregaon ( refer review posted). We have two...read more"
"This place was recommended to me by my friend, he got take away from here to the office. So my review will be limited only upto food.
Food-Chicken sukkha, neer dosa and chicken masala special was on my menu. Sukkha chicken was amazing...south indian flavours backed with right spiciness and juicy and tender chicken is something makes me love it. Chicken masala special was not that interesting. Neer dosa was soft, though taste changed as it was traveling from long."

"Hello Readers,
WORST RESTAURANT & MANAGER EVER SEEN!!!
         Yesterday (on 7th June, 2015) I ordered a parcel dinner which include a Chicken Tikka Masala ( stale Chicken, only 5 small pieces, not so tasty), Two Naan ( Used lot of Maida in it, hence difficult to chew) and a Mutton Biryani ( This was the most weird dish ever I had in such type of big restaurants. First of all I couldn't understand, why  a single Mutton biryani contains around 8 big meat pieces. All the pieces were stale (Baasi or Purane in Hindi) ).
           Guys! more to hear ahead. I then decided to call restaurant manager. Phone picked by one of the waiter there. I shared my experience to him he told me...read more"
"I absolutely love this place ....
-For the Food
-For the cheap liquor
-For the friendly wait staff
-For the outside seating and the rooftop

Firstly, the food .... This place is typically a seafood lovers paradise ... Surmai Pomfret Bombil Prawns Squid .... All are absolutely amazing ... Try the fish (surmai/pomfret) or prawn tawa fry starters (they come in Red and green gravy and you need to choose) Red gravy is more spicier (finger licking though) .. I enjoy the green one a lot more because the heat is not overpowering ...
For chicken lovers ... try the Gulati kebab
Ooh and if you dont drink but come here for the seafood ...also try their Seafood Manchow soup ... its orgasmic for a...read more"
