What a ugly taste of pav bhaji seems itâ€™s no taste just filthy need my money back kindly do not order from here itâ€™s not at all tasting as pave bhaji chi never order from here
I asked for jain biryani ... but the instructions were ignore and no contact number available to call.. found onion in it
I don't think the juice is fresh. It is stinking
we have always ordered from Deepak. but this time sabzi of the masala dosa was almost one fourth the quantity n no taste n for two dosas the chutney was too little. disappointing
