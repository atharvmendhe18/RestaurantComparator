Review
"We came to the BKC outlet for lunch today. I ordered the chickpea burger which was truly disgusting. We were 4 of us and three of us had finished eating and there was no sight of the 4th persons dosa.

On top of that the staff has a very obnoxious attitude. The restaurant has a lot of big bottles full of some fermented items. We generally asked the server what they were and he told us with a condescending tone that it‚Äôs not achar and most ppl are more ‚Äúaware‚Äù and would know what that is.

I get the food is healthy but it tastes so bad that it‚Äôs a punishment to eat at this so called restaurant.

I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"Not worth the hype, some food was oily (Mushroom tikki) and some was far away from value (millet dosa).

Salad‚Äôs were decent"
average salads. too many bland greens and very little of the paraphernalia as mentioned in description. the dressing doesn't suffice even half the salad.
there was no poached egg in my order and they sent me simple cheap mushrooms instead of the oyster ones!
I paid 50 Rs extra for sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes they added are NOT sun dried tomatoes.
There was no dressing sent with the salad
Great place for healthy & yumie food . Matthew recommended some really good dishes.

The smoothie didn‚Äôt taste the same. Tasted weird .
"The guy catering us forgot half the order, and we kept waiting like fools for over 40 mins. Such low service standards."
stale food
pretty bad experience. I gave cooking instructions to make it a cold latte. no sugar was given along with it ato add.
"Pathetic taste, stale fish and bad quality food. Other premium healthy places in bandra and bkc assure much better quality and wholesome food at the same price. No sequel to sequel even again!"
Asked for vegan waffles/pancakes contained egg
Turkish eggs were stale
Was there on 15th June 23 food was excellent but suddenly there was loud argument in kitchen between two employees and all the bad words were exchanged between them which can be heard outside which spoiled the evening and the complete experience no manager was there to pacify them
poor poor quantity.
Ingredients were not fresh
Food had hair strand. The delivery experience was poor. Reached very late
Useless and poor preparation .. all ingredients are just a stale food.. never recommend anyone to order from sequal BKc branch..
bad packaging. doesnt look like the real deal. i have ordered from sequel before. this looks fake
Didn‚Äôt include the tofu that I paid extra for to be added
did not taste good
Bad taste.
Excellent food and impeccable service by Mathew! Truly original menu and wonderful flavours. Had always ordered in until now but our first dining in experience did not disappoint.
Totally incapable of handling orders. 6 persons on the table served in almost two hours. Pathetic service and highly overpriced.
"All the items we ordered were great. Appam, energy salad bowl, tacos. Great ambience and quiet place for chit chatting. Very European feel."
Nice decor quality of food is good. I enjoy my drink and snack price is also GOOD good experience in this cafe

Awesome food and excellent staff. Clean and hygienic and idk why it doesn‚Äôt deserve a five star rating
"The place is so goood. Its a vibe and a must try.
Food is a definite 20/10
Exceptional attendance by Matthew"
"Average food, stone in food found and complaint for the same.. argument for the same, single person serving
Service is pathetic, one person all around...none to attend at all"
"organically sourced ingredients and gluten free food ! I liked everything I ate. Loved the ambiance as well. I liked that it‚Äôs a healthy place to eat however not serving only vegetarian.
Everything I tried :
1. Smoked Red pepper hummus , mixed seed almond and buckwheat crackers
2. Finger millet dosa
3. Red snapper burger
4. Prawn Tacos
5. Dessert - Dark chocolate cake with buckwheat"

"Had a yum though expensive meal with friends here. Their Energy salad bowl is fantastic & huge. The Cacao ice cream was a treat. Being vegan, I had a smaller range to choose from but it was more than enough. V Helpful and Prompt service."

"Pathetic hospitality! Ordered only 3 dishes And waited for 1.5 hours for the food to arrive yet the third dish never came on the table!
The entire staff, including the owners were just catering to larger group and even if after seeing what happened to us, they were unresponsive to the entire scenario.
Don‚Äôt think would ever visit this place again!"

I thought I always liked this place till I got spoken to the way I did. The management including the staff had a snobbish attitude that was despicable. If one can‚Äôt be hospitable then why be in the hospitality industry?
"Literally the worst ever decision to go to this place. Been to many healthy caf√©s all over mumbai. Got One small piece of avocado toast for the price they are charging. Secondly we ordered for cacao smoothie bowl and while taking the order, the staff did not mention they don‚Äôt have a smoothie bowl and took the order. Much to my surprise it turns out they served a plain cocoa smoothie which did not taste great at all.
Please tell us if u don‚Äôt have smoothie bowl on the menu instead of taking such orders.
The pancake taste was good but again they reduced the size of pancakes as compared to earlier one.

In short:
-Not value for money
-Quantity is too less
- Please change the menu...read more"
The food was ok but the staff‚Äôs attitude is pathetic. Each one has a different version for anything on the menu. Do not waste your time and money visiting this place.

A great healthy option to go to. Fresh preparation and very helpful staff
"Loved the ambience, Loved their coffee ...in fact , addicted.....and the healthy bowl was decently portioned.

The complain we have with the delish bowl is two pieces of green peas cakes and almost non-existent roasted millet.

Vibe and hospitality was top-notch."
"We had an extended Brunch at Sequel, starting with the Millet Ghee Roast Dosa and Acai Berry Smoothie and then the scrambled eggs and avocado toasts. All the items were very well prepared and delicious. The ambience was also very elegant, with lounge jazz in the background, and very artful cutlery."
"We took a chance with this cafe despite the abysmal reviews, on a friend‚Äôs recommendation; and boy were we glad we did, since we now have our new favourite healthy food cafe! The interiors are beautiful and fresh, the service was great, and the food phenomenal. Great options for egg, vegetarian and vegan food lovers alike. We had ghee roast finger millet dosa, acai berry smoothie bowl, daily dose of vitamin C mixed juice, jigsaw (scrambled eggs on sourdough toast) and the sequel tartine (avocado, cheese, tomato and capers) on multi grain bread with tons of nuts. Absolutely loved every single dish we ordered. Even the breads were fantastic and nutty. Not sure what happened with the...read more"

"Ambiance is great, food looks good and they have healthy options. Staff is average in hospitality , over priced , quantity is very small and from taste perspective also .. it‚Äôs average
Good to go once for coffee (just for experience)"
"Pathetic food, and god knows why they think they have the right to charge so much for literally dirty food. Had 4 dishes, all were horrible including the guacamole & the disgusting and stale fish taco. Ended up wasting 4k , worst decision"
"We firstly waited for 30 min to receive our first dish. The food was highly overpriced. 2 tacos for the price of 500. The quantity wasn‚Äôt sufficient for even 1 person. On the good side the food was healthy and well presented. The a√ßai bowl was the best item we ordered, recommended. The red snapper tasted weird and we weren‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs the way it was supposed to taste."
After seeing all Instagram photos visited this outlet and was put off by the quality of food sweet potato fries no human can eat what was served and they call it healthy. Pls avoid
"For the money you pay, neither do you get the quality, nor do you get the quantity. Not even sure whats the point of this place. They‚Äôve made healthy eating blander some how and you‚Äôd regret shelving out money over something a restaurant that feels like someone‚Äôs afterthought."
"Too expensive
Too less quantity
Good food
But not worth
Quality good
Quantity bad
Price list shld change"
The food was stale. Everything was very sour. I‚Äôve been to many healthy places but never had such a bad experience. Don‚Äôt ever come to this place even if you‚Äôre running out of restaurants. I would never recommend
"Honestly, i hate doing this at a time when restaurants are struggling but this has got to be the worst meal I‚Äôve had in a loong time. The tacos were particularly bad. The black rice was over salted and over whelmed by the kaffir lime. The guacamole was passable. Everything else was awful with the polenta souffle being the worst. Cant decide which was worse, the food or the eternity we had to wait for it."
"Yummy fresh food, lovely ambience, a very smiling staff. Our server Zorem helped us select the best dishes and we over ate üòòü§§"
"Healthy, organic , authentic food! Just loved it! All dishes are well presented and to the expectation. Loved the service . Kudos to team sequel !!"
Very bad service. Food is underwhelming. And there was plastic in the Icecream. Just extremely disappointing. How can you serve tacos on thepla! I imagine fusion is in but get a bit more creative if you have to! Otherwise stick to original. Anyways my take never ever going back.
"One of the best food chains in Mumbai right now and the newest outlet in BKC out does itself in many ways. To start with, they have two sections with two different menus. Everything that they offer is fresh, organic and very very tasty. I had the regular berry bowl and from the new menu tried the smoked orange sweet potato with parsley sauce. The food was to die for. Must try."
