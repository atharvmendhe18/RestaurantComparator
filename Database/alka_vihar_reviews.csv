Service not upto mark the manager was very rude and had no consideration for customers view seems they have lot of business and are not interested in any customer feedback
""
Very poor taste and packaging

"We have ordered from Alka Vihar before and had liked everything earlier, but the latest experience was very disappointing. nothing was upto the mark in terms of taste or quality"
"missing item: pav bhaji
taste: all item (sabji) were of same taste. All were dumb in taste."
I ordered a panner tawa pulav and I don't see any panner
"Very bad food, service. Also staff was not at all hospatile.Plz do not order or approach such restaurant.Total waste of money."
who is responsible here for wrong delivery? zomato or Alka Vihar?
My favourite restaurant since my childhood days. Normally we go for Dine in but due to my mother's age now we order. It's good now the restaurant is on Zomato and hence could order and saviour the taste.

"tomato onion uttapma of alka vihar is all you need for the breakfast, the quality and quantity of it is dam good"
Masala potato stuff was not smashed properly and it had little taste.
Quantity of Chutney was less as I ordered 3 Plates. Rest all were Good.
VRY NC FOOD LOVED IT THANKS ZOMATO AND ALKA VIHAR
Bhaji leaked from the packing ...hotel didnt packed properly..please send me another order
Food was great. I had to call up the restaurant and tell them to accept the order
Quantity lesser than the one I ordered 2 weeks ago
I ordered non spicy paneer makhanwala ..and I mentioned non spicy ðŸ”¥ .. perfect for my kidooo ... Thank You ...Alka Vihar...
this 44 year old outlet in malad serves the best food in the industry
phone call service so bad restorent is so busy with work done want to listen to customers
Bhaji was stinking and same with the onion which was give along it. Poor quality of vegetables used in making the bhaji.
The bag was completely formed if it goes on like this there will be no safety hygiene
I asked for dry noodles and Schezwan chutney like it is served in dining but that did not get delivered at all
""
"Less/ Shortage supply of additional pav, please refund and credit the same to my account ."
"The potato bhaji had less salt, and some pieces.of potato were not cooked well.
Also, the vada seemed stale."
"Inside the cheese corn balls, there wasnâ€™t enough cheese and corns were uncooked and raw!! So disappointed! Never going to order this from there !"
"food is always excellent at Alkaa, our favorite restaurant"
""
Must visit this place very nice food. The quantity is good for 2-3 people with normal appetite.
one item missing. called restaurant and ordered again. very bad experience.
very bad taste of pav bhaji..neverever gonna order from alka vihar
"No salt at all, raita is also sour and quantity is also less as compared to price."

Food is good but the service is pathetic. The waiter in the AC section behaves as if people are going to eat for free. Never visiting again because of the terrible staff.
