Review
Packing was sealed partially. Gravy leaked.
"Aum fine dine is a really famous bar in malad but it has really good food and the taste,quantity and quality is also good the service is fine and timely.

We tried the the stuffed paneer tikka which had many paneer pieces and in between it had vegetables slices along with salad. It had very good quantity and paneer was super soft and this dish can easily serve 3 people.

We also had royal handi khichdi it was basically a rice preparation with yellow dal gravy along with various veggies and topped with cheese peanuts and papad bits which was a new dish for us and we really enjoyed it

The quantity and quality was not compromised and the value for money was good because taste as well as...read more"
"best quality of paneer and dal value for money, best place for veggies in Malad.."
best in class in malad you don't get better paneer and Chinese food at this rate anywhere...have been fan since ages..the taste remain same
Food was not delivered properly. Packaging was not appropriate.
The Biryani and Handi were bitter and slightly burnt.
pav bhaji was exceptionally very tasty never ever had such a tasty pav bhaji. also the combination rice and manchurian was very taste it enhanced my taste bud for the night....
Had paid 116 for a cheese sandwich and had expected to receive a big size of sandwich which could justify the price but received just 3 slices of bread with grated cheese in it. The even did not bother toast it. Highly disappointed as the sandwiches did not justify the price.
"With no intention of defaming the restaurant, I write this just as I'm done with dinner with my family.

2 hours to get 2 subzis, 1 Biryani and some Rotis.

And when that arrives, horrible food. Possibly the kind of food that can get you sick.

I'm scared that we don't get a stomach upset tomorrow.

Stay away even if you get 50% discount. I repeat."
Paneer bhuna was not fresh and Subji was not what was ordered
Late delivery Roti was very hard not properly cooked
"Burnt Rotis, Spring roll cooked like sabji. could not eat. overall horrible food.

Zomato needs to do quality control before putting one of the highest rating on restaurant.

This kind of food combined with high rating can definitely discourage me from using Zomato in future."
Veg Makhanwala is one of the Best of AUM. We really love it.
""
Worst of white sauce pasta I‚Äôve ever had. No one ever served spaghetti pasta with white sauce before.
""
Burnt basil garlic paneer is super. so is lucknowy biryani. Price is good at quantity and quality of food offered
"I have been visiting this fine dine restaurant since two weeks, had a good time here.

Good to have normals drinks along with some Italian food. Pasta was good."
"Food was good slightly salty
Cooperative staff
A bit small
Drink was okayish
In starters I'd recommend paneer in burnt garlic
Kulcha was good
Recommendable to friends
A new try"
"I have been to this restaurant more than 5 times now &amp; the experience was always fantastic. Even to the friends to whom  I have referred they enjoyed dining here. Their staff is very friendly &amp; food is excellent. You can try any item from the menu - I am sure it will meet your expectations. Very reasonably priced - almost 30% lesser price than the nearby restaurant Shiv-Sagar.... I recollect few items which we had tried at AUM & all were par excellence --- Veg. Handi Biryani, Paneer Steak Sizzler, Mirchi wali Subzi, Garlic Naan, Naram Dil Kababs, Seekh Kababs...... Just go there and treat yourself..."
"Staff is very helpful and polite they changed our seat twice as there was a family with kids who were making too noice and obviously for kids u can't expect them to be quite so I just requested them in case if they can and they changed the seat.
Point to make a note is that they kept tobacco sauce on my table and I just happened to see the mfg and expiry date and came to know that the sauce bottle was expired one later when I told them they thrown it in the dustbin so just keep A note of these... Can happen in any random restaurent.
Now coming to food we ordered cream of sweet corn soup which was good but was not going with the name as there was nothing like cream in it.
Later ordered...read more"
"The restaurant is situated in my neighborhood so had visited this many times or ordered for midnight cravings.The restaurant have many cuisines to offer and they Excel in most of them especially starters whether it be North Indian,Chinese or Oriental or Continental. Main course is average. While in desert they don't have much to offer. However due to bar facilities the restaurant have liking for family outing limited despite having separate section for them. Staff is quick and courteous. Overall a good restaurant for dinner or lunch with friends or family if you're okay with people drinking around."
Best food ordered through Zomato till date.. Perfect blend of traditional kabab and continental/Chinese food. A perfect food experience for enjoyable weekend. Shall try more next time
"Vegetarian bar and restaurant.
Super food super staff, best place to be with family and friends.
Specially paneer quality is the best, though overall food is good."
Had been Thier on Monday ambience and all is good had ordered soup was not at all good and then kebab which were most bad thing I had Thier. Also ordered beer which has best part chakna with it and it was yummy
"This is a nice dining place in malad west which can easily be missed as the entrance looks as if the place is closed.

The food though is amazing. I have been here twice, once for lunch and then for tea (Cottage cheese Sandwich and tea). I have not been disappointed both times. The quality of food is amazing, though it might take a bit of time for the food to be prepared but its prepared with care and one can taste it.

The ambience is ok. The lighting and entrance could be better."
"Liked the food
Had order
Crispy veg (jain)
Spring roll (jain)
Kung pao potato
Hyderabadi biryani (jain)
Only concern was raita sent with biryani was non jain
Had to eat plain biryani but
Anyways it was tasty"

"Awesome food to top it with awesome service. Very regular as the choice of veg food is excellent and very well prepared. Regular to this joint, the menu is real good. Keep up the good work guys, cheers.."
"Ordered for Kashmiri Subzi was nice but was taken aback with the red color on top. Looked like roohafza but I guess i it was best gravy. Apart from this color issue the food was awesome.

Butter naan is not good at all. It take a lot of effort to chew.

Roti is better and goes well with the Subzi."
"Reasonable pricing, good ambience, good service and good food above all. Anokhi saabzi was good. 1 star less as we had to say 3 times for soft rotis!!
Still must try!"
Good place to hang out with friends. Would not suggest for family dinner. Food is amazing in taste. Aatish Aloo is must try. Ambience is okayish.
"This is an amazing dining place in malad West to have veg food. Ambience is calm and music is smooth. Staff is also nice.
Coming to food, they serve great veg sizzlers, probably the best in area. Taste is good, not so spicy. We have tried paneer biryani as well, it was delicious.
We had paneer appetizer, it was also nice. Quality and quantity both.
Food 4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Service 4/5"
food was good. please have the carry bag for delivery boy.
"Good packaging, good food and perfect food for veggie lovers!! 1 star less only for salad box. That could be better in quality, size and shape."
"Went to this place with family last sunday.. veg restaurant with a bar.. place is small and ambience is as any other veg restaurant not too loud or grand...place was fully packed..we rilly liked the food.. it was very very tasty. Our order is as below:
Corn and jalapeno soup, shanghai soup, raseela aloo, anokhi sabzi and mirchi wala paneer.. it was finger licking.. enjoyed evry bit of its taste ..The anokhi sabzi is a mix if exotic vegetables.. which was nice and blended with its gravy.. it is recommended for foodies.. u wil surely love the food if not the ambeince. The waiter who served us was quite mindful to get us onions, extra spoons, lemon, chutney.. it was crazy packed.. dont mind...read more"

Great
thanks for the best service
"Worst experience. This place used to be our fav for vegetarian delite. We went here after a long time. Saw their menu card has been changed.
They have valet parking but when I approached the manager for help, he was so lame and low on body language. He called the guy as he was parking another car. Manager asked us to park it on the roadside itself. After much difficulty we did and then arrives his person just to collect the keys. What nonsense.
We ordered for cream broccoli soup - the soup wasn't creamy at all. It used to thick and creamy before. We had it so many times before. We were not able to have it. We informed the manager. He was so indecent that he shooked my husband's hand...read more"
"A multi-cuisine restaurant which can be easily located. Tried all the cuisines out here. Would recommend chinese, thai & north indian. Mexican is sweet & will not live upto your expectations. They have 2 sections both are AC. It is a bar & restaurant together so on a Sunday evening one will find large groups of people having drunks especially during matches and less of family crowd. Service is quick. Staff is courteous. Little tight on space. Overall a decent experience.

Today I tried this restaurant which is near to Malad SV road and my experience was really good. There were many variety in menu. I tried cheese broccoli soup which was recommended and was quiet good. Also tomato soup. The North Indian was also nice with both quality and quantity. Overall not excellent but was a very good experience.
"So when I've got to take my mom out for dinner..the preference has to be veg places. So on my commute to work I've been passing this place 'Aum' which my mom had seen too. So on Independence Day we decided to give it a try. Initially we thought it's going to be something like Shiv Sagar but then checking the menu on #zomato told us it was fine dining with continental Indian and Chinese. Well we decided to try anyways.

Well entering the place totally changes ur opinion compared to how it looks from the outside. For starters it was empty (a few ppl did walk in later) which isn't a good sign especially in a Gujarati infested area on a holiday. It's too brightly lit because of which the...read more"
I ordered cheese girll sandwich with no onions. And they gave us bread butter and chesse with vegetables. They don't have fcommon sense that when a customer says no onions it means half jain. Please don't order from here unless you have money and time to waste!
"The ambience is fine. I ordered mushroom and babycorn, fried rice and a chinese gravy which was delicious. However I didn't find the mushroom and babycorn very great."
It's a nice joint with a nice ambiance for a Restaurant. I have had chance to try their range of Chinese soup and it was worth every penny. I was in a rush when I went there but I am looking forward for a full course meal.
"Had reserved the table through zomato and after reaching there when asked for reserved table no one had answer... as went with family for dining so asked for the inner section table but the manager was like already reserved for 20 people

Later after 10 mins a group came and were allowed to accommodate inside???

This type of reservations fiasco sure last visit to AUM

Food is good but hospitality is worst

If going out in group ya family make sure search other options also before coming to AUM"

"Had a small party with my family ,they have a small family hall inside ordered for alfredo corn nachos,which was delicious ,they have a wide variety of dishes to choose from and reasonably priced
We ordered for indian main course of mirchiwala sabzi and anokhi curry which was good service was good waiters where attentive and cooperative
Could have been better if they had a bigger hall
Over all enjoyed this place will try next time"
"I visited the place with our family at about 8.30pm restaurant was jam packed but still got the seat after waiting for few minutes We ordered for paneer shahi paneer tikka and crispy burnt garlic which was excellent.

"If there was a rating like minus zero I would consider giving that too they don't deserve the 1.0 rating coz they don't have that option to keep it zero .Pathetic service indecent waiters and the manager doesn't deserve to work in this place.Anyone here wants to take the ownership of becoming a manager they have no proper hierarchy in case of complaints, they have no decency to apologize for their mistake.The food I would say is dangerous be careful what you eat coz I found a piece of plastic not once but twice.And these people do not have the courtesy to speak politely to customers when he knows it's their fault. The feedback was given before finding the piece of plastic the second time...read more"
The service can be made much much better. The food wasn't that tasty and waiters weren't polite. The voice was too loud and the waiters were talking very loudly to each others. The overall experience was bad.
"Located on marve road & near NL college
Having a Rare Combo of Veg Food & a Bar

Its interiors are quite Premium like with a Small Bar area & also a TV best For Sports.

Food: Had Paneer Platter as a Starter .Was Decent
It has a variety of items to choose From.

Veg kolhapuri & paneer Pasanda with Butter roti was A good Classic one but Quantity ws a little lesser But okay when compared to price.

Hyderabadi Biryani had good amount of veggies with Raita.
Bar Menu had all drinks @ GREAT Prices Without Too many Service charge/ taxes.

Service : Staff was Helpful & Were always available .I think Space would be a Constraint on Weekends.
Right Taste, Ambience & Price are its Strength.

Will try...read more"
Excellent Restaurant for veg food. Manager Santosh is always very welcoming. All food & even drinks are reasonable.Good for people who are looking for veg food with drinks.
"This place earlier served Veg and Non Veg along with drinks but due to a meagre response from the vicinity of Gujaratis and Jains they took off Non Veg from the menu.

So now its a VEG Restaurant with Drinks.

I have been here a couple of times and found the place to be decent.

Tomato Soup was pretty well made.

Paneer ke Sholey in the Appetizers is a must order for everyone .

Tried the Dil Bahar Subzi in Red Gravy which was also well made.

They also make up a good Veg. Biryani.

You won't be disappointed if you order the above mentioned dishes.

The service is fast but the captain should learn to give suggestions in terms of specialities.

Overall this place is good for the localites...read more"

"Visited dis place yest for dinner
When i entered the place I felt little awkward as I was the only woman and had gone alone but then i saw a family dining on the other side
There's a small seating area on other side
I had ordered 'cheesy brocoli soup' n it was veri veri tasty .
They have variety of food items from indian to continental to thai n oriental n also starters N soups N main course
N most of food items are available in jain
It's veri nice choice for ppl who prefer to go to veg restos N who eats jain food
N they also provide banquet hall
Nice for family outing
Must go for food"
"We entered at around 3 but still we could get lunch ..which was very great sign..
Then came the order, we started for some papad and we ordered for keecha MASALA papad.
It was amazing.
Then my wife ordered for some Punjabi cuisine and I ordered for some ITALIAN Pasta.
In the mean time we also ordered for CREAMY cheese Brocolli Soup..and it was amazing..I couldn't stop licking the bowl...
Pasta was also good.
And Punjabi was OK..as per taste..but that's our opinion..
You can for sure try it.."
Food for veg lovers is awesome. Spl all paneer items. Even the owner Vasanta shetty very friendly person. Must try for veg food n drinks. Reasonably priced.
Lovely ambience awesome food nice place to dine with friends n family..... Try the veg tandoori platter decently priced menu. Heaven for veg eaters
Om fine dine is one of the best restaurant in western suburb ...I have personally visited with my family I liked the food best what I liked was the hospitality extended by the staff & specially Mr vasant's co-operation & friendly approach towards all costumers made me feel special I personally suggest all the veggies to visit this place to have a world class dinning experience I wish them a great success in future.

"Althought it is a fine dine restaurant, we always order food at home and Aum have never disappointed me.
Being a multicuisine it gives everyone their choices and our favourite is burnt garlic rice with coriander sauce.Both, quality n quantity are good.This time we ordered a continental main course dish ,Cottage cheese taco style(jain) and it was delicious.Everything was very nicely assorted and packed.It was quite filling too.
One thing was absolutely disappointing, Exotic tacos.It was filled with over cooked n too much flavoured vegetables n very blend cheese sauce.

"A family outing or a hangout with friends; depends on you. The one who served us and took the orders was really kind. A place, where you get all the cuisine, which is the best thing. I loved the Paneer starter and Mexican Risotto. Quality of the food was awesome. And it's f*cking Pocket Friendly!
6 of us, just ‚Çπ1400, with having 7 different dishes ordered."
"Food is OK ,service is pathetic ,don't ask me why ?it's a big list.pls don't be there with family .u vl b dissatisfied and disappointed. They treat all customers lyk they are in a bar with quarter system.pathetic the only word comes to mind ."
"Amazing multi cuisine restaurant! Specially for people who would prefer a pure veg restaurant.
Nachos was okayish! Crackling spinach veg was good, but thai gravy with rice was one of the finest dishes and super yum!
One thing great I found, when ordered for kulfi, the manager came to us and informed that the kulfi is too soft, instead of directly bringing it and then disappointing the customer!
One suggestion to the restaurant: No doubt you have a superb menu with lots of varieties in all types of cuisines, but please increase the variety in deserts :)"
"I loved this place.Everything from food to ambience to staff.We ordered chilly red paneer which was super good and creamy nachos that is yummy.The best part was lasagne and yangdong noodles.
Everything was really tasty but I wish the desserts and mocktails had more variety.
Must visit place for all vegetarians.For a group of 4 it billed up to 1300 which is definitely a worth for money"
"I been to this place today..its amazing..what ever food we orded tht wad serve on time..its a family restaurant,ppl must visit this place..nice ambience and awsome ppl to serve food..always with a smile.tried continental food and sizzler. .its tasty..

This restaurant deserve 5++++ rating..:-)"
"Decent interiors. Ambiance is Nice. Staff needs to know more about the menu and servings. Service is a bit slow. Indian dishes were good.

Decent restaurant for family dinner."
"A centralized air conditioned vegetarian plus bar multi-cuisine restaurant. Lenghty and lovely menu covering lot many dishes, decent ambiance with good food. Tum Yum soup to start with, made to exotic taste. Tried salt-pepper potato paneer in starter that was made perfectly with basic condiments and spices. Wasn't very keen on trying the main course so ordered a Sizzler, which came out really well with sufficient quantity. Ended the dinner with a dessert banana split - a three scoop icecream placed between half cut ripe banana.

All in all a decent restaurant for family dinner.

The 4 star rating is for their renovation they did from a local bar, food and service."
Local restaurants cannot beat their menu.. the quality and taste of their dishes is wowwww.. they hav an exceptional menu.. and quick service.. must try cheese brocoli soup.
"Nice place for vegetarian.. Perfect starter.. Perfect main course... Perfect mocktail... And perfect desserts... And perfect bill...
The best part is that they have many items to eat in jain..."
"Veg Restaurant & Bar, on entering the first impression that I got was it seemed a bit shady... 3-4 tables occupied, just men drinking... The inner section had 4 tables with 1 occupied by a family, we took the other. We ordered Creamy Nachos, decent enough, but the tortilla had a lot if ajwain. Other starter we ordered was Mexican Baked Potato, perfectly cooked and amazing flavors, the baby potatoes were stuffed with cheese and some American corn, the sauce was nice and tangy. I'd surely order it again, also the quantity of this starter was really good,4 people can have it. For main course we ordered Paneer Steak Sizzler which was also really good, quantity is enough only for 2 people....read more"
U will see more men in groups drinking than families / couples / friends eating out there...(Huge drawback) Ambiance is ok... Indian dishes ordered were good... They have a pretty good variety but didn't do justice on the italian dishes we ordered! More of a call and order place (home delivery preferred...)
Decent interiors.. not a place to go with family as they serve alcohol and you see people drinking around you. Garlic bread is good.. nachos is not up to the mark.. I ordered sauted pasta it was a disaster.. indian food is good. Service is a bit slow.
"My excitement knew no bounds when I first heard about  AUM FINE DINE .  

Talking about the food, my description about the place so far clearly validates the awesomeness of the food they serve here. Service is pretty quick and food quality is up to the mark.

The ambiance is totally spot on, creating a perfect dining experience,& for all occasions .

The waiters were well informed about the food they were serving and they suggested good dishes as per our choice. The service was really nice.

Overall the experience was much better than we had expected.
