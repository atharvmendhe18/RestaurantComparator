"A superb veg food restaurant to enjoy food
A friend took me late night for dinner
Amazing pav bhaji n cheese garlic bread
The faloda was perfect
A must visit place"
Amazing pav bhaji with nice ambience. Perfect for family outing. Their main course is also very nice but we just love their pav bhaji.
"Amazing place near to colleges. We go there post classes or during lunch to enjoy a good delicious vegetarian meal. Their pav bhajis are a signature with a good dollop of butter.
They also serve many cuisines like south indian, punjabi, chinese and continental .
We had hot and sour soup, paneer 65.
Both were very good and tasty
The ambience is very pretty with bright vibrant colors.
Can't wait to go back and have again ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"My go to place to eat Mysor Sada Dosa (specifically).
Do try - Neer Dosa, Masala Pav 99, Cheese Garlic Toast"
Achija is well known for pav bhaji. But i would like to say that cheese garlic bread and pizza are the best. Also its Chinese is just incredible.
"We accidentally bumped into this place and to our luck it turned out to be an elegant place. Apparently it was a sweet accident. Ambience is overwhelming and refreshing. Place is pleasant and clean. Staff was polite and attentive.

Food - Was tasty, nice and fresh. Menu had alot of things to offer.

Ambience - Pleasant and Refreshing.
Price - Average not to expensive at all.
Overall truly and truly loved the place."
Must try ‚ù§Ô∏è
Just a woooow. Specely pav vaji. I will rutern this place

A Great place to have Paav bhaji in Ghatkopar. Being a die hard fan of Paav bhaji I usually don't like paav bhaji in most of the restaurants but paav bhaji in Achija is mind blowing.
People like pav bhaji here but frankly speaking pav bhaji is not that good. Decor is great though. Value for money #valueformoney
"Visited few weeks back.. pure veg family restaurant. Tried their pav Bhaji and cheese masala pav with stuffing. Very heavy and spicy. Enjoyed the meal. Visiting again soon.

Overall -
Food - 4/5
Service - 4/5

Achija is located in Ghatkopar. It is very famous for pav bhaji. Taste of pav bhaji is so yummy and pav is full of butter. I have also ordered pineapple juice and watermelon juice. It was really fresh and tasty.
"Here Comes Achija In Ghatkopar for His Famous Pav bhaji ..
Mouthwatering Buttery Pav Bhaji with an amazing taste...
And Also famous for its fast food ..
Just visit here it is the place for Super Foodie.. ‚ú®
..... Fast food is popular because it's convenient, it's cheap, and it tastes good. But the real cost of eating fast food never appears on the menu. A party without a cake is just a meeting. Dear Diet, things just aren't going to work out between us...!!*"
"Achija is famous for Pav Bhaji's , pulav's and pizza's. They are since many year located at ghatkopar. With their unique taste they have manage to expand and have opened many outlets in mumbai itself.

The word ""Achija"" means come again in Kutchi. Also, many of their loyal customer are kutchi and Gujaratis.

What did i ordered?ü§î

1) Cheese Pav Bhaji: It one of the best pav bhajis in mumbai. Nice bhaji which isnt too spicy, plus loads of cheese. Speciality is the red power they provideüòãüòã which make bhaji more yummy ü§§ü§§.

2)Veg Pulav: I haven't seen too many ingredients in a pulav. It was nicely cooked and kajus made it more yummy üòã.I like to call this dish as...read more"
Each and every dish about this place is best. Garlic Bread was one of our favourite. Pav bhaji is also the best.
"I wouldnt say they have the best pavbhaji but I rated this place for their overall service. There's nothing to complain about this place right from its ambiance to it's food. Service is alright but if you mean business with the food, you're good!"
"Amazing food, especially pab bhaji and masala pav, best sitting area,well air conditioned Must visit"
"They Serve High quality food. Taste is at its best. Pizza's, all types of Sabji's, Chinese Specially their Pav Bhaji makes this place the most attractive place!"

"No one should ever visit thi restaurant

And worst ownerü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢ü§¢"
The Cheese PavBhaji is just so delicious at this place. Also try out Cheese Pizza here which is worth its price.
"This is 3rd Achija restaurant in Ghatkopar east. But is BEST of the LOT. Ambience awesome, service excellent, Food JUST YUMMMM. üòãüòãüòãüòã
The place is always crowded and variety of options available. My fav are family room types private sitting areas.üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Food try anything and you should not regret soups to starters to Main course and desserts all cooked well over your expectations...
The very done up Achija Juice Centre in Ghatkopar is always kept clean and is well maintained. Great amount of natural light and air enters the space during the day through open windows, keeping the space well ventilated. The well spaced out tables are nicely complimented by cushioned chairs....read more"
It was an amazing dinner by Achija restaurant. It was really nice food üëå And they delivered the food on time as they say. The container of the food was of good quality as there is no leakage in it. So everyone must visit or ordered the food from Achija Restaurant..

"I have tried Pav Bhajis from more than 50 places in Mumbai but the Pav Bhaji From Achija is very special. There is a magic in their taste.
The Pav is so soft and drenched with butter. Bhaji is prepared with best quality ingredients and tastes heavenly. I even like Cheese Bhaji at Achija. Best part is the place is very close to my flat and I can order it using Zomato.

Once It was raining heavily in Mumbai and all the Mumbai was water logged. Achija was the only place which was available on Zomato. I would like to thank their Entire Team and the Zomato Delivery executive for this"
A very delicious food dal Khichdi i ordered here from zomato.very soft and Yummist easy to digest.good food.
"Amazing food...!!
Pav bhaji is the best. Super tasty and super swift services.
Their grilled sandwich is really tasty...!!
Recommended to visit"

"We visited this place on the occasion of marriage anniversary of Mom & Dad. It is a nice place, though little bit costly.
Quantity is fine and tasty, worth for money.
We ordered
- Paneer Tikka Masala
- Veg Chopa Masala
- Daal Tadka
- Mosambi, Pineapple & Watermelon Juice
- Roti, Naan
- Butter Milk

All of the dishes had really good taste. Good restaurant for a vegetarian party.
Enjoyed the visit."
Badly overrated...pav bhaji not tasty...it came with a sour tinge...overly priced and weird taste...rude staff...not at all equipped in handling big crowd... less quality of hospitality...
"Ambience- 5/5 Beautiful Interiors
Staff & Service- 4/5

A beautiful restaurant with tasty food.
If you're visiting on weekends be assured of long waiting hours,usually crowded.
Have tried their
Masala Dosa 5/5
Paneer Tikka Dry 5/5
Pav Bhaji 4/5
Fried Rice 4/5
Manchurian Dry 5/5.
My regular place for dinner outings."
"Horrible place. Me and my sister had ordered Special Pav Bhaiji, which is also speciality of this place. But this place gave us Pav baji which was more than a day old. After eating from here, me abd sister both have got food poisoning. I will never recommend this place to anyone. The hotel has started compromising on quality just because they have customer base now."
It's a best place to visit with friends. We had the cheese pav sandwich and original mojito which was very tasty.
"Test and delicious food iteams really awesome in test

I ordered pav bhaji and masala pav ....both the items were tasty
When you want to eat Indian food in Chinese style this is the place to go. Thank god for being pure vegetarian.

One of the best places to eat at in Ghatkopar. One has to wait in long queues on weekends as the place is loved by all. The South Indian cuisine here very famous. Achija has more than one outlet in Ghatkopar so do visit the place for some delicious Indian food.
"Everything is too good staff,food,ambience,crowd
The only thing is waiting"
"Best place to sit and eat your fav fast food - the most special and the most demanded and high selling item PAV BHAJI which is been loved by everyone and for which Achija is known for its restaurant.
Very fast serving."

"Visited this place in ghatkopar very famous and heard from alot of people. Finally got my hands on their lived cheese roll. The bread was soft and yes the amount of cheese it was topped with was quite good. The cheese tasted of good quality though. Its just a fastfood centre.
Ambience-3/5
Food-5/5"
Really love this place for its amazing pav bhaji. I'm a pav bhaji addict and it serves one of the best pav bhajis in Ghatkopar! It's a good family type restaurant and it's located in the food street of Ghatkopar. Definitely try this place once.
"Must have
1. Pav Bhaji
2. Masala Pav-99
3. Jelly, Juices, desserts.
4. Cheese Garlic Bread

I have been visiting this place since my childhood and the taste is still the same."
"With nearly 2-3 restaurants of same brand under 200 m of distance..The one located on vikrant circle is my favourite food for its quality of food and good seating area.
Pav bhaji and dosas have been too tasty."

"We waited for 30 minutes, patiently, despite being told there was just a 10 minute wait for a table for 2. And after that, other customers were constantly taken ahead of us - again and again - despite repeated reassurances that we were going to be seated next. And then when we asked them why it was taking so long, they kept showing us cancelled names - claiming that the table was so and so‚Äôs, etc.

Can‚Äôt believe how and why a restaurant like this would flourish. If there is no seating available for 2, the restaurant should just say so, up front. And if not, they need to start ensuring that the customers get seated in the order they‚Äôve come - without any special preferences etc.

"Ratings for what we ordered -

1. Manchurian (Dry) - 2/5
2. Paneer Crispy - 5/5
3. Paav Bhaaji - 4/5
4. Manchurian Soup - 3/5

Overall Ambience - 5/5

So when in Khau Galli where there only street food stalls or so so restaurants it is a welcome change to find a fine dining restaurant serving delicious food."
"Pricy and not worth the taste has been always inconsistent.
The portion size is good but taste is not that well so one must not plan special occasions for such restaurants irrespective of their brand name."
"The staff was so cheap. I visited there with my friends directly from college and while sitting there chatting we heard the owner/manager talking with one of his waiter and saying ‚ÄúIf they order a lot of food tell them we cannot serve the particular dish right now‚Äù speculating that we would not be able to pay the full amount.

While paying we were collecting each one‚Äôs contribution and he was like starring at the money we were counting and standing right on top of us"
"We love Achijas Pavbhaji which is all time favourite and their garlic bread with cheese is soooo daaamn gooood! The only take on our next dish, tava pulav, could‚Äôve been better. Good place for pav bhaji I bet! One of the best you can have in Mumbai."
"This place is located at the heart of ghatkopar - Khaugalli .
I would not be wrong saying they are the most famous pav bhaji place to be worked out in here .
they serve amazing pav bhaji , which will really sooth your taste buds ‚ù§Ô∏è if you are ever going to khaugalli do visit this place , although the place is mostly crowded the service is way to quick
budget friendly"
"We were at khaugalli....came across this famous place.....could smell the aroma of pav bhaji around the streets.....couldn't wait to go and taste the pav Bhaji....place is crowded....
