"I am fan of this place as the concept is good plus, super fresh ingredients and healthy food what else you can ask for. You can make your own salad and they do have some amazing varieties of sandwiches.

I don't know what others might be saying about this place but for me it's a perfect one. Pleasant ambience, comfortable sitting, fresh and tasty food what else you can ask for.

All the best for the management. üëçüëçüëç"
I called the place to order s/w. They took the order on the phone and now I am here waiting to last 10 mins and they got no clue.
"On the 1st of Jan, with a view to start the year with a light healthy meal at lunch, a friend and I set off for Kitchen Garden by Suzette at Bandra Kurla Complex.
In the same complex, Maker Maxity, that houses Le Pain Qoutidien.
It was buzzing with a young crowd- similar to the Le Pain crowd- mostly bright and affluent young employees of the offices in the complex ( I think Google has an office in the Complex). A crowd that is looking for healthy and fashionable food.

"This is an ideal breakfast or brunch place. I had scrambled eggs with mushrooms which was served with 2 slices of sour dough bread. The eggs were creamy and cooked to my liking.
The berry panna cotta is really really good! I really recommend having it. The berries are really fresh and provide the right amount of tartness which goes really well with the panna cotta!"
"Pleasant place for healthy food. This is inside Maker Maxity in BKC. Very crowded in the afternoon from 1230 so be prepared for a long queue. Had the Italian Salad, Greek Salad, and Chicken Sandwich. Burrata was a little sour, but that may just be my taste. All ingredients were fresh and enjoyable. Felt somewhat overpriced, but again, that may be a matter of preference."
