Nice
good üòäüëç
food was half cooked and no proper container packing. only the gravy of triple schezwan was in a container.
"Bad quality rice and chicken, the Schezwan sauce which was sent had turned bad. Packaging was terrible and the food was sent in a plastic bag just like a roadside stall."
"portion size can be improve
it's high amount for that mch portion"
