mustard sauce after long time found of this quality
Food was good . However lasagne had come spilled
""
It’s a go to place for us whenever we have to chill around or hang with group of friends till 1 in the night. It has a good vibe. Food/drinks are priced on the higher side.

"Great place for pasta lovers. It has a vibrant atmosphere located close to juhu beach. The ambience is really good and it will make a great place for a date. We tried their Veg Lasagna, it was very delicious. The dish was savoury and it's a must try whenever u visit juhu beach."

The chicken sizzler with rosemary sauce along with garlic bread was good and staff was nice and hospitable
"Chicken anglais was in fully damaged condtion.

Half of the chicken and full of sauce wasn’t there in delivery"
Literally grown here all my life. Best of the best.
"While it is understandable that the pizza was stone cold due to the rain, what is unacceptable is the very low amount of bacon. I've ordered this pizza a few times before and had quite liked it. But today was a really poor show. The stars given are only for the positive attitude of the delivery person. Disappointed with the pizza. Wasted almost a thousand rupees for this??"

"Very unhappy with the food. Being a chef myself there are a lot of improvements in a lot of places that can be made. Firstly in terms of guests who make loud noise right next to your table can be requested to calm down as there are other tables that can get distributed.
secondly I ordered a bunny chow however it was tasteless even though had requested for less salt I think can be done better.
the pizzas are good the cheese fondue is super salty.
the chicken which I had ordered was specifically undercooked and pink in the centre which was not expected out of such a nice place at all.
however overall ambiance n experience was good.
request chef to work up on the food."

"Costly place , less quantity of food
Beware 10% service charge"
Taste of the food needs an upgrade they just serve normal taste food and chargehigh amount i think

"lasagne was good

garlic bread were very average"
What’s with the quantity
The food needs lot of improvement.. the veg sizzler with marinara sauce was aweful.. very dry.. they forgot to serve the sauce.. the chicken nuggets were very bland.. the best was pizza .. the rose sangria is worst i have ever had.. i wasteful sunday lunch experience..
cold food did not arrive for an hour
I regularly got food from Zomato. I don’t know wat went wrong on this order. The appearance was horrible. The pizza was not welll rounded. And the chicken put on top is just huge chunks The jalapeños are just thrown all over the pizza.

"The food and all is fine but the people serving are pathetic. They commit offers while placing the order, but when the bill comes there's no offer applied as such. So in a way, they are fooling people to buy more in the name of offers."
"Generally a lot of young crowd, but the ambience is good and the food portion is fine. Taste is quite okay but overall great experience.
The place is crowded especially during the evenings and on weekends."
I loved this place and this is going to be my go to. A perfect place for a date. The service is so good. People are nice and helpful. Had a great experience. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I've been an Alfredos customer for 15+ years and today's pizza was extremely disappointing. the crust was extremely dry and burnt from the edges. Actually the pizza base hasn't been up to the mark the last couple of times but today's was really not good. No idea if they have changed ingredients or something else.
"By far the best salad I've ever tasted in my life..

what we ordered :
-The Cesar Salad 10/10
-Chicken Alfredo Penne pasta 9/10
-Hungarian Chicken with Veggies and Mashed potatoes on the side 8/10 (loved the mashed potatoes more though)
-The Blue Hawaiian Mocktail 9/10"
"Delivery person , ate pizza from my box and then delivered"
"This place is crowded especially during the evenings and on weekends. We waited for 20 mins to get a seat for two. We were seated on the loft, there were many mosquitoes and the hygiene of the place was just ok.

We ordered mushroom filled with cheese, chicken stroganoff and black russian. The starter was nice and crunch, however, stroganoff was not as per the expectation. I found a small hair in the sautéed veggies in the stroganoff :-/

Overall like the ambiance and music of the place. I think the place is overrated."

Horrible food and service
"We ordered frito miso and they gave shrimp dish its not fish , description says sole fish"
"Perfect place to have authentic italian cuisine

food: 4/5
ambience: 4/5
service: 4/5
pocket friendly: 3/5
menu: 4/5
vegetarian options: 3/5
hygiene: 4/5"
Generally has a lot of young crowd. Love the alfresco seating area. The ambience is extremely casual and therefore attracts a lot of beer drinkers.
"We keep coming often to Prithvi theatre but always skipped Alfredo’s but went yesterday around 10.15 pm. While it was packed- Saturday night, the waiting was only 5-10 minutes. The food was amazing we order Cottage cheese sandwich, butter garlic prawns and the highlight was the recommended old fashioned cocktail with JD- loooved it !! The vibe was great, cool crowd.. the place was packed even around 11.30-12 pm. If you are in Juhu- recommend to drop in at Alfredo’s"
"We had visited the restaurant on a Sunday, there was only 1 group waiting ahead of us. When we said we need a table for 2 they didn't bother secondly they didn't write our name.
There were 2 groups which came after us of 8 people and 6 people the staff name is Bhim who is over smart. He accommodated group 8 before us table for 4 was empty but he didn't let us sit, when I said will post a review on Zomato he immediately gave us the table. The staff is very rude and arrogant, they dint even have proper uniforms to wear, beware of Bhim and the other guy who serves the outside area. During the bill I said to remove the service charge he said sir aapko 10% off Diya hai service kyon nikalna...read more"

"We refused the French fries and requested extra mustard instead in Special Instructions. However we didn’t receive extra mustard, bit disappointed
No French fries as per our instructions which is good"
Very bad experience.. soup of tasteless and potato gnnochi pasta was bland. Service was extremely slow. ..got the food after 50 minutes of ordering..ruined our evening.
""
Worst experience .. i think you should value customers
Less quantity
""
......pepperoni pizza with a single piece of pepperoni on each slice......cold .....tasteless .......ordered a Tom Collins and asked for no ice .......tasted like sugar water. Used to be a good place ....no it's just garbage.
Pizza was entirely tossed out.
Usually a decent place but today have been sitting on my table and waiting for a meal .The wait was endless .Too much time taken for meal to be served .Not easy getting the staffs attention today was told food will be served in 2 minutes quite a while back .
""
the food came like this. the packing was very poor
Excellent value for money.
""
I find the Service to be a little disappointing for the price we pay. Food seems average but the staff is not ethical and fair in my opinion.

The cafe has indoor and outdoor sitting as well. The ambiance is simple. And the food is tasty but it’s quite expensive. Tried the Pizza Alla Margheritta and Penne Verdue Pasta which was served with garlic bread. Both were good in taste and flavourful.
"asked for iced americano and sent hot americano.
wrong product sent"
"Food is bad - worst experience. Give the quality of food against what you are charging for.

They can't even cook a Margherita Pizza properly. It was like a crunchy readymade pizza base with dried cheese over it.

The mushroom croquettes are the worst - Tasteless.

In Ceaser salad, instead of croutons - they have added bread as it is. Imagine what they have done to the classic dishes.

It's a nightmare. Left the food on table - no one among the 4 could eat it. Informed the staff about the bad food, but no one paid any heed.


I am frequent to their Lokhandwala Outlet.
This Juhu outlet used to be my go to place since college days. But my last visit yesterday, Changed the perception of...read more"
"The staff over here is PATHETIC! They are extremely RUDE to their customers. They will talk amongst themselves to “kick” you out - due to their own bad services.
You have to ask them 5 times just to get a glass of water.
HORRIBLE SERVICE. HORRIBLE MANAGER. HORRIBLE STAFF."

"Alfredos is a cool place to go out and have a meal with friends and family.
We ordered the Bombay Rouge Pizza and Vegetable steak with Mexican Sauce sizzler. Both of the dishes were really good and worth trying. Their sizzlers is always a must try.

Do visit this place if you are in and around Juhu."
"We had gone as group of six and me and my wife went after seventeen years …. We ordered veg and non veg as our guests were non veg . We went for fondue pasta and spaghetti which was well cooked and sauces was perfect . Fondue was good .. the non veg was piazza and couple of European dishes which was good given it has stamp of approval from UK based guests . Only issue is they took long time to deliver non veg dishes , we all most finished veg one … we went on cake on our sons insistence but that is a avoid as they seem to have good collection of cakes but was stale … overall a great Italian experience food wise could improve on service quality"
Horrible experience…never going to visit this place again. Was being forced to pay service charge and on refusal the staff behaved very rudely. The lasagna tasted like palak ki sabzi.
"Order was incomplete, cold coffee was missing."
Very bad experience of food. Completely ruined weekend dinner
The quality and quantity of food served here is next level. It is very famous for its Mexican food. You can visit this place with your friend. The staff here is very friendly.
"This place holds the biggest chunk of my heart, right from my college days to taking my lil one, the food quality, the ambience, the service and the staff hasn’t changed one bit. It has the perfect mix which has helped sustain this place over the years. This place is pure nostalgia for Mumbai peeps. Right from their mezze platter, chicken harrisa, soft shell tacos, thin crust crisp pizza’s, mushroom risotto, cheese fondue and the cocktails are some of our favourites and keep us calling back for more. If you are looking forward to a great meal this is the place to head."

"The alfredo sauce gnocchi had to be the best dish ordered.
The sauce was creamy and the gnocchi was soft & melted instantly.
The other dishes ordered were Penne Arrabiata pasta and Bombay Rouge pizza.
The taste was spectacular.
Recommend this restaurant to everybody, especially for pasta lovers.
The ambience looks very pretty in the evening/night."
I had ordered for a chicken stroganoff with sour cream and I was sent some brown sauce whcih was terrible.

Awesome
thank you 😌
"Food was not as such expected.!
The staff was unpleasant to us particularly the manager. Even pasta was undercooked.. so would not recommend this to anyone."
"A much famed Juhu hangout spot, Alfredo's ambience is absolutely inviting with its overall aesthetic that shouts coziness and comfort.

That however is the best part. The pizzas are just about decent, definitely falling short of the price. For an establishment serving Italian, this was a bit underwhelming.

The service is super prompt and kind, always ready to help."
Really too little quantity
"Alfredo's has lost its charm. We ordered for a mixed sauce pasta which was very watery. There's wasn't much cheese and vegetables in it, even though we had specifically asked for it. Overall the taste is extremely bland. The place too was extremely chaotic and claustrophobic, the AC was not working either. Big thumbs down. 👎🏼"
"This is one of the classic hang out places in Juhu. Well known for their pizzas and chill ambience, they have really good starters. We had their chicken skewer and Tunisian spiced fish - both amazing starters.

For mains, their pizzas are excellent and Hungarian chicken is a must have!

Our server was Himanshu and he gave really good suggestions"
The lamb kebab was good but chicken lasagna which was of 750rs it was pathetic...the chicken was raw and it was tasteless...also the service is not good....not worth

The pizzas were probably from some other place. No branding. No restaurant name. The pizzas inside boxes were having few to no toppings. The taste was terrible. Few of the slices were placed on each other. Seemed it was tampered.
