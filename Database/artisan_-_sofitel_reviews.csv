"Loved the prawns tempura and the Mango Cream Tub.

"I along with my family went to Artisan for post dinner desserts.
Here‚Äôs my honest account of disappointments with Sofitels service.

I had reserved a table for 10:00 pm on a Sunday. And as expected the place was 60% empty. I was late at getting to the hotel so kept on calling all the listed numbers for Artisan and the deskline at the hotel reception at least a dozen times. NOBODY PICKED UP. Once at the restaurant, I gestured to the attendant by the name of ‚ÄòUpasana‚Äô thrice. On the fourth attempt she came to see me and after humming and hawing she agreed to sit us. Meanwhile, she evaporated away to tend to some, I am assuming, VIP‚Äôs. We were shown a few options to sit in the...read more"

Lovely food‚Ä¶ enjoyed our avocado burger and tempura prawns.. and a lovely pizza. Definitely recommend!
Too noisy for a bar. And the waiters flatly refuse when you ask them to turn down the volume. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Service is 2 out of 5. Not welcoming, had to call the server for everything, water, menu, food, check. Food was ok. Menu is quirky and limited cuisine choices. They would not let my teenager son in since it was a lounge. The place was empty as in no other table apart from us on a Friday evening. Avoidable place. Too expensive for the kind of quality of food and service."

No information that after 7.00 pm restaurant turns into a lounge....we did booking and arrived with our kid at 9.40 and the manger says kids are nit allowed after 7.00....is it not necessary to mention this some wer....after 9.40 we were haunting for the restaurant...this service is not acceptable from a 5star hotels...kindly look into this and chng ur procedures..how we will come to knw tht after 7.00 kids are not allowed...we even buyed the vocher from siwggy...bad service
We did booking via swiggy.....and we reached the restaurant at around 9.40....and they told kids are not allowed here after 7.00....damn mention this some wer tht kids r not allowed....update this....highly disappointed....not a 5 star service

Wait times are terrible. Charged us for a couple of cookies which should have been complementary folks! Where's the hospitality in the 5 star?
"We ordered for paneer shaslik and pesto pasta. I‚Äôm very disappointed with the following
1. The quality of the food was very bland and not very well cooked. The pasta was semi cooked and wasn‚Äôt cooked as per the advice to include pesto sauce . There was hardly any pesto sauce. The service was poor and not responsive. The serving staff do not show a pleasant and warm courtesy
2. Paneer was hard in paneer shaslik and again, not cooked . The quality of paneer was also below par and not up to the standard of a 5 star

I would not recommend this place . Pl avoid . There are much better options available for a better cuisine and good customer service

Sofitel folks.. you need to learn...read more"

"We visited the restaurant Sunday afternoon for lunch. Half of the things were not cooked properly and a lot of dishes were not available. Moreover, we felt uneasy after having the food out there and fell sick in the evening."

Great ambiance but not a place for foodies. We had gone for valentines day. Food was expensive in comparison with the taste
"Our server vinayak waa extremely helpful and courteous, and the food was delicious! We had a great time over all"
"Went there to celebrate wedding, great interior and polite staff. Ordered drinks like sour lemonade, orange juice and mocktail merci which was vanilla ice cream based drink with apple and much more, and a orange basil refreshing mojito. For starters we got chicken tikka, lamb galouti kebab, dhokla chat which was amazing and prawns. For mains we got their margarita pizza very tasty Drinks were quite refreshing and food was very delicious."
Very courteous staff... Best place and area to celebrate any occasion. Visited there with family on a occasion...had a memorable evening
Missing chef Vincent‚Äôs secret meat loaf.!! Had it four years ago and I can still remember the Smokey flavour.

"My friend had recommended me this place and I finally visited yesterday for lunch. It‚Äôs a nice place to sit, relax, enjoy a great meal and complete your work. I had ordered for a tenderloin steak and it was very nice of Louister to recommend me the grilled sea bass. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the sea bass is definitely a crowd winner. Came to Artisan alone but surely will visit it again with family and friends. Louister is also a great asset to the restaurant and deserves much kudos."
To begin with this was my 1st visit to Artisan and i kid you not it was worth the experience i treated myself to their superfood salad that was fresh crisp and worth the price Jay recommend a hot chocolate that was made from calabuit single origin. The ambience is classy and they have comfortable sofa seats. Manager Trevor was warm and greeted me and assured that as a guest i was taken care of he also offered me a macroon. My dad enjoyed a cup of the mogo mogo tea a recommendation made by Trevor. Ambience 5/5 Wifi available Food 5/5 Staff 5/5
"Artisan is our go to.place for meetings. We treat the Sofitel as our second home when we come to Mumbai. Since we are based at Platina Artisan is the ideal place for quick lunches and amazing coffee.Recently we tried the Hot Chocolate that was really yummy.Trevor the Manager is a man behind the success of this cafe his team members chaitali and Jay are always proactive and assist our group.Since we will not be back I want to say a big thanks to Trevor for all his assistance, will miss this place and the wonderful staff."
Good food with good hygiene. Great place to visit
I and my wife came to artisan in the afternoon on 13th of October 2019 . We had a lovely afternoon there. Although it is a busy restaurant . We were served well. Creme brulee was excellent. Thanks to Jay who took good care of out table And bartender who made lovely Mohjito to us.
"1- FOOD (4.5/5)::

Past 9pm on 18th Oct, I was frantically looking for a customized cake when i was recommended to Artisan at Sofitel. I quickly had a conversation with Trevor (whom i had met and interacted on my previous visit) and requested him for a customized cake for my dad to be delivered the next day at 4pm. After that, it was all magic!

My dad was so impressed with the overall presentation. Although, we could excuse the fact that it was'nt too polished for the likes of a 5 star; I'd give full marks to the staff dedication and the quality of the Chocolate Truffle cake!

"For a five star restaurant that charges a bomb, they aren't much.
Food is very mediocre especially considering the prices. I've had much better tenderloin in places cheaper than this. Even the coq au vin I ordered was overcooked, which was a let down.
Also the water bottle was dirty and seemed like it hadn't been washed a long time.
Staff was courteous though and ambience is good."
great restaurant lovely food and awesome ambience the staff is also very friendly cant wait to go back soon....great work by hemangi and jonathan with their service...good food cooked by bishant as per my taste....love the bombay girlled sandwich...its a must try‚ù§Ô∏è
"located in the vicinity of the US Embassy my love for Continental cuisine took me to the plush lobby of this hotel which was packed with business class tourists .As I enter their restaurant I spot an overwhelming number of firangi diners alas i was in the minority .the ambience is that of a very sophisticated luxurious fine dining place in Europe . The extravagant buffet presentation was indeed a delightful sight. from amongst a vast array of dishes i sampled the following vegetarian continental dishes.

"It is an amazing restaurant! Loved the Club sandwich!!
Definitely try it out.
Polite and professional service by Aman Yadav.
Will surely visit this place again :)"
Food in Artisan sofitel is really amazing. You should really try MUMBAI GRILLED SANDWICH and MUSHROOM SOUP. It was mouth watering delicious and as well as decor is awesome. Service given to me was really good by Mr. Aman. He was very polite and well dressed.
"Artisan has become one of my favourite hangout when I simply don't want to do anything and just relax.

Loved the French Onion Soup and the Sandwiches they serve"
The food is great but the service is really slow. It is a good place to go for a quick business meal or a quick lunch. Zomato Gold makes this place a good place to visit.
"I visit the restaurant for their monthly masterclass this time centred around Italian cuisine. ‚ÄòThe Italian Job‚Äô, a name given for the masterclass conducted by Sous Chef Jomal Lopas consisted of simple & easy to make dishes like Burrata Caprese, Basil Pesto, Chicken Cacciatore, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce and Sage, last & my absolute favourite, Tiramisu.
Chef Jomal Lopas was patient throughout the class and guided us through the entire process. To be honest, I attended the masterclass as it had Tiramisu on the menu & I am a baker, but after watching the simple & easy steps to cook up these Italian dishes, I‚Äôm definitely going to try my hand at it.

"Such an amazing place to read quietly, and eat good food. However, it feels like they are short staffed, but the food quality is not compromised."
"I would like to reiterate my rating to 10 on 5

What experience we had a month ago and what we had yesterday was 0 to infinity.

The kind of hospitality these guys had shown and the kind of arrangements they had made was just simply outstanding.

They do take customer feedback extremely seriously.

Thank you Manoj and team for the excellent hospitality and correcting the actions of the hotel."
"The Artisan - Sofitel is located at BKC.
The decor is elegant & lit up each and every corner.
The seating is very comfortable.
The food served here is Continental and American. They have a huge assortment of Wine collection in there menu.
I‚Äôd ordered the Zucchini sandwich is highly recommended and along with the two glasses of beer or wine."
"The Artisan is located in lobby of Sofitel hotel in BKC. They have different exotic varieties of pastry and macros section at the entrance. They have a separate section where the chef takes master class on chocolate making.

The ambience is wonderful, there is view of garden from the restaurant. The food served here is Continental and American. They have a huge assortment of Wine; it is a French Caf√©.

Coming to the food

We order Wild mushroom soup, it is thick and creamy soup. it was full of flavours. it was authentic, one of the best soup I had. they served it along with small loaf of multi grain bread cut in slices along with butter. (They do not serve one by two in soup)

"""So you don't have a passion for food?""

No I reply in a manner which seems to cause palpable discomfort to the local journo, who had rather charitably decided to mention the ""AA Connoisseur"" in a feature splash in one of the local Mumbai rags. I try to explain that the restaurant reviews are just a conduit for literary expression. While journalists seem to agonise about getting a story, the restaurant critic has a ready-made subject at every street corner or in any new restaurant or bar. The venues themselves may end up as ephemeral footnotes in Mumbai's cultural history, but I am sure many a tale of insobriety, romance and conviviality within these endroits will prevail.

"I was attending a conference at Sofitel and was early to the start. Ofcourse got there early at the cost of skipping my breakfast, so my hungry self took me to their French cafe Artisan.
I ordered a baguette sandwich with tomato and mozzarella. It was a sumptuous morning breakfast with a huge sandwich served with a bunch of French fries, can someone ask for a better start to their day!!!
Go here for some amazing sandwiches and Paninis"
Fancy ambience with an open lawn and a classy place. The food taste is okay-ish but tue desserts are awesome special the dark chocolate mousse
"We visited Artisan for dinner during the Magnifique Staycation at Sofitel Mumbai BKC. Our 3-course dinner was inspired by typical French food and consisted of Soup, Plat Principal and Dessert. A sweet and smooth white wine accompanied our meal. 

We opted for the Potage (French Onion Soup) and Soupe Aux Champignons (Cream of Mushroom Soup) for the first course. The Potage came with shredded chicken and was creamy in consistency. The Soup Aux Champignons was made in a traditional French style. 

For the plat principal (main course), we tried the Saumon Grille Aux Beurre Citronn (Grilled Salmon with Lemon Butter Sauce) and the Crepe Aux Epinards Et Aux Fromage De Ch√®vre (Spinach & Goat...read more"
"As recommended by one of my friends, I visited Artisan Restaurant, the food here was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. I especially enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Ballotine which was soo delicious. The servers here are just wonderful and very friendly, they also suggested us nice pastry‚Äôs which were awesome. I would surely visit Artisan again to enjoy another dishes. Thank you!"
"Was here to pick a cake and dine in .
We ordered some sandwiches and the ambience is amazing . We called for a Mumbai grill sandwich which had curried potato filling with veggies like cucumber beetroot onions and a chutney .
I opted for the brown bread and this sandwich was super Tasty , use of fresh ingredients made it even more better .

For the cake we called for a Belgium truffle chocolate cake and this was so gooey and so rich also not to forget moist and well made.

Located within Sofitel bkc this is perfect place for catching up with frens n family .

Loved the decor ."

"The French Cafe at the Sofitel BKC recently introduced board games.
From Monopoly to Scrabble, to various card games like Uno, there was something for everyone.

We had a blast enjoying their menu which had a soup, sandwich and dessert along with the board games.

Artisans is wonderful with an indoor and outdoor seating option. The staff was very polite and quick and the pricing seemed so reasonable for some memorable time with friends.

Best way to spend some quality time with friends and family alike."
"Visited this French Bistro late afternoon with some friends for some chill time. Being a part of Sofitel it definitely set the standard with it‚Äôs beautiful interior and a welcoming staff. They have a outdoor and indoor seating section but we got a table inside since it was really warm outside. We came across their new section with lots of games like monopoly, jenga, uno etc. They have an offer going on in which you get a few drinks, a salad/sandwich, a dessert and of course the games for INR 1500/person. This was a sweet deal and we went for it. The servers were humble and suggested us dishes and drink exactly as per our taste. Here‚Äôs what we tried:

"Artisan is located in BKC. Its inside Grand Sofitel Hotel on the ground floor.

The ambiance is really cool as it has inner & outer garden section for seating. Inner section has a live desserts counter. Its decorated very well with champagne bottles all around which overall looks superb . The tables & chairs are arranged systematically for small & big groups.

This place is French Bistro. So they are specialized in serving authentic French cuisine. The Tapas menu served after 6 PM onwards. The options are less for vegetarians here. But the menu is good with variety of options. Price its costly but its worth it.

Disappointing delivery service. I had ordered a tenderloin sandwich at around 8:50. On not receiving the order by 10:00 I tried to call the restaurant to check the status of my order. I tried on calling 4 or 5 different numbers including the number of the restaurant's manager but nobody picked up the call. Finally I got a call back around 10:25 just to tell that the restaurant can't deliver the order due to a private event. The restaurant had confirmed my order immediately after I ordered and after one and half hour later they say they are sorry they can't deliver my order.
"All time favourite desert place. Had 4 different flavours and must say ‚ÄúYummy‚Äù
I really don‚Äôt remember the Name of each one but two favourite was Rainbow and Mango.
Rainbow was supper smooth not too sweet like others.
Whereas Mango was total surprise. It was so soft.
