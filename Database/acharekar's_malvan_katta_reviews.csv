"I was here for a dinner.I ordered the following dishes:-

1) Bombil Fry Thali-Batter Fried Crispy Bombil served with Rice Bhakri,Rice,Dried Coconut Chutney,Solkadhi,Curry.It was great in taste


2)Prawns Masala n Bhakri- The prawns were cooked in rich mixture of coconut and onion base gravy.The ambience is good the place is quiet and the food is up to the mark.

I am definitely going to visit here again."
"Not a good place. Found spider in sol kadi.
Not recommended. Also they rejected online payment. Be careful."
"Nestled in the lane behind Sena Bhavan, This restaurant has become my favourite in Mumbai for my seafood cravings. The price, quantity, quality does justice to your expectations. Must visit"

"We ordered a chicken kharda thali and halwa fry thali. The quantity and quality of chicken was amazing. Most delectable, soft bhakris. Scrumptious fish fry and flavorful curry. The vadas were hot n puffy. Loved the entire experience. Definitely a must visit!"
"After a very long time finally was able to experience authentic malvani thali. It‚Äôs a paradise for seafood lover. Prawns Tawa Fry and Crab Stick would be my personal recommendation in starters and Sea Shell, Pomfret and Surmai Thali was just amazing. Place is simple and economical. Definitely going to visit this place again. Finding this place can be tricky if you follow Google maps. Recommend to ask local once you are near Shiv Sena Bhavan."
"Iconic restaurant for a reason. Situated in Dadar West, this place is a Sea Food lovers paradise. Maharashtrian food at its best. I tried Surmai thali, Clam shell fish thali & pomfret thali, all 3 were heavenly. For starters I had Prawns, Bombil and Crab lollypop, again all 3 were scrumptious. Their Sol Kadi is one of the best. Small place is a true hidden gem. Hospitality was top notch.
Pricing compliments food quantity, quality and taste.
.
I highly recommend Acharekares Malvan Katta. Go Try!"
One of the best places to have Maharashtrian food. Iconic in every sense. Fish thali was super delicious. Service is also really good. More visit coming soon.
"My most Favorite restaurants for Malvani cuisine is Acharekar Malwan Katta. All fish lovers are in for a supersonic treat. Not only does it have an extensive seafood on the menu but also chicken dishes which are age old recipes of the owners mother.
The place has simple decor but the food speaks louder than anything else.

We ordered :

Prawns Masala
Surmai fry


Also ordered two whole Thalis

Prawns Fry thali
Pomfret Fry thali

Each thali consists of a fish curry, fish fry, solkadi, bhakri and spicy masala mix. Onions and lemon is served in a separate dish.
The Rice bhakris were awesome so soft and well made. And fish was extremely fresh, tasty and served piping hot.

"We wanted to have sea food so we visited this restaurant today, In my experience, tisrya masala preparation was very basic not even the malwani style and the worst was yet to come, looking at the quantity, we called for malvani chicken sukkha, it was a mistake to order bcz the preparation was like the south indian hotels who serve malwani food, making gravy in quantity and adding boiled chicken.
I understand you are bringing the malwani roots to cities like Mumbai but really don't make fools out of people by adding the word ""Authentic"", I think you need to either change your chef or the chef needs a lot of training.
I'm a malvani and this is not the food that I can expect....read more"

"I didn't realise that I am a seafood fan until I tried the seafood from this amazing place. I loved how the food was light and yummy to my tummy and, pocket too! I am a sucker for prawns hence my favourite of this place is Fried Tiger Prawns and Pomfret Fry."
"With the growing demand for seafood restaurants in the vicinity of dadar there has been always waiting times to get a seat. Likely because of the homely food being served so the craving goes more and more. However, Acharekar‚Äôs Malvan Katta has always been a savior for us as we got our table on time and we didn‚Äôt have to hunt anywhere. Food here is simply amazing and total value for money. As it is tucked inside some may find it difficult to trace it as we had faced the same.

Pomfret Thali ‚Äì Always a delight to experience and relish pomfret thali. It is one of the only fish which satisfies me completely.

"Craving for seafood this is your place, Simple ambiance and good service you will find an easy menu with great taste. I will recommend this place for people who are into seafood do try crabs my parents are very fond of seafood.
We ordered Crab Masala,
The Crab was fresh, cook to the perfection, the best part was that the dish wasn't much spicy and had a balanced flavor. The curry has nice blend of coconut. It is a thick curry.
As the name says the Malvani Style; Bombil fry is a must to have here.

"If you are crazy for sea food, Achrekars Malvan Katta is the place you must visit.One of the best authentic Konkani restaurant.Interior is completely basic but feels like you are sitting in village room. Service is great. Since it has less sitting arrangements, so one may find waiting. They have all the variety of fishes & thalis which a typical non vegetarian would love to have.Fragrance of the food is awesome, delicious and have great appetizer.

We had
‚Ä¢ Prawns fry
‚Ä¢ Bombil fry(both were fresh & crispy)
‚Ä¢ Chicken masala

Generally served with wadey which makes a good combination to have with. The food was not too oily but the spices added to the fish were spicy. This all is...read more"

"Visited this place with three best friends cum foodies. Its in lane of shivsena bhavan. Its a small joint but very famofor marathi non veg coastal food. If u visit this place on Tuesday and Thursday; u will get less crowd, otherwise it is heavily crowded. Simple sitting arrangement. Moderate interiors. But great food. We tried rava fried prawns, crab lollipops, bomblil fish, chicken sukha, surmai fish fry and solkadi. All tasted very good and authentic. Must visit for marathi non veg coastal food lovers"

"Achrekar's malwan katta is one of the tasty seafood serving hotel located in Dadar west;

Must visit to Achrekar's malwan katta."
"I loved the food here before the Lockdown. The fish was fresh and the wade were nicely made.
My father took us for a family dinner date and it was worth it."
A basic seating arrangement with simple malwani food. Affordable for everyone. No AC available. Looks like a bar.

Average food. Expensive compared to the food. Not going back there again. Being a famous hotel in dadar they neither have card facility or UPI facility for payment.

Maharashtrain food . Fresh meat and fishes placed. The bhakri was also very soft and yummy. Solkadi is also aussum.
"Hi, As we wanted to have fish.. And wanted to search opts. For Gomantak and Sandadgur..we landed up in Malvan katta, it's in Sena Bhavan galli.

Experience :
Ordered Chicken and Fish Thalia
Rate -Ok
Food - We went at 9pm. Their was no Wada available. But after request, we go one plate Vada. For that also they charged extra.
Food was also not that great.

Final verdict - go for Gomantak or Sindadurg.. If you are near Shivaji park"

"Nice place to try sea foodüêü
Service:Ok
Ambience:Ok
Overall food:Good
We tried komdiwade with chicken sukkha, prawns, bombil fry, amboli and surmai fry(was not fresh though)."
"You want Malvani food must visit this restaurant.
I liked the taste and quantity of food.Also at peak time this place is very much crowded because of tasty food."
I have been here more then once for having special and traditional n typical malvani food the fried fish and chicken and fish thali and speciality is for chicken wada
"I went there with my family. I would recommend going there sometime before the open. The waiting increases afterwards till 1hour. I ordered for Mutton Thali, Pomfret Thali, Chicken Thali (All Thali accompanied with Rice and Chapati), Bombil Fry and Prawn Fry. To begin with Mutton and Chicken were very well cooked and the masala was marinated well enough with the pieces. Pomfret Fry was something you would order more and more. It was fresh, crunchy and juicy. Also Solkadi is my personal favorite."
Worst experience with this hotel..ordered Tisarya masala ..there was no TISARYA..they had given EMPTY TISARYA as well and only 2-3 Tisarya we have got which was really very small...that Was not worth....the gravy which provided that was really very spicy.. couldn't even eat..overall worst ever experience with this MALWANI hotel...#dont even try this dish here# it's totally waste of money.
A very very hyped up malwani restaurant in dadar. Totaly marketing gimmick. Food is not dat great. Didnt find it too interestinb. Plus delivery charges fpr building next to the restaurant is 50 rs. Dats very sad. Not so much recommended
Malvan Katta is a very nice place if u want to have authentic malvani food and if u are a fish and non veg lover. Surmai Fry is very good and a must try. Chicken kheema is not that great. The rice bhakri is so good nice and soft. Another thing we tried here was the prawns rice which was very good. Had all the flavours coming in. And last but not the least one must try the Solkadi which so refreshing. They offer thalis or single dish whatever u like. The staff and the owners are very kind and polite. The ambience is not that great but decent. Overall it is value of money. 4 people can easily ear belly full in under ‚Çπ1500.
"There are very few restaurants which serve authentic Malvani food and Malvan Katta is one of them. This is definitely a hidden gem in the busy area of Dadar. There is not much hype created about this place but the food which they serve is mind blowing.üòç

üåçLocation: It is located near Swami Samarth Math, one of the prominent places in Dadar which is usually crowded.

‚ôàAmbience: There is not much happening with regards to Ambience you can see pictures of Malwan and few lamps on the wall. The entire place is very immaculate. There are two different sections the AC and the Non AC. The place heavily crowded on Sundays, Wednesday and Friday and you have to wait for around 15-20 mins...read more"
Perfect place for malvani food. Awesome food taste and quality. Felt like delicious home food. The fish was crisply fried and the chicken gravy was perfect.
"Supeerrrr food for dadarkars located near swami samarth maat...Their will be huge rush during saturdays n sundays....But waiting is worth..U can go and have their pompret fry with amazing bhakri and also chicken masala..
Superb stuff to try"
"They are lacking of everything. Zero customer service, food had no taste. When we gave feedback that the clams dint have any meat. The waiter dint bother to check or take any sort of action, . The flavours and service is not like before. They are losing consistency on food quality. We were disappointed with the whole experience."
"Awesome food...must try surmai fry,prawns fry, chicken sukka,jawla bhaji nd solkadhi.. small restaurant but Value of money..staff services is good.."
"We were just roaming around this area and wanted to have malvani food for dinner. As gomantak had too many people waiting outside we found this restaurant on Zomato decided to go there. This place is like a home only in which they serve tasty Malvani food. We ordered chicken suka and prawns tawa fry, usal and bhakari and wade. Then we ordered solkadhi and chicken pulao. Everything was tasty especially solkadhi but they served it at room temperature so 1 point less for that other wise it was good experience. Staff was friendly and service was quick as well. If you want to have malvani food in homely atmosphere then this is the place for you."
"Was facinated by seeing people waiting for their turn to be seated for their meal. Thought to get a take away instead. To my surprise,rather shock i found all 2 dishes pathetic. Prawns pulav tasted more like 'fodni cha bhaat' that is what is called in marathi. Prawns sukke ideally is a coconut based semi liquid dish. I received a tomato onion diced veg sabzi with 4 medium sized prawns.
I wonder if they are serving people better in the restaurant and delivering left overs as parcels."
"Taste 3.9 / 5
Ambience 3.6 / 5
Service 4 / 5
Hygiene 4.6 / 5
Cost 3.8 / 5
Quantity 4 /5
1 should try surmai fry, bombil fry and pomfret fry with bhakri. Gravy was good."
"I ordered a solkadi and mutton masala. The solkali cost me ‚Çπ45 but was not even worth ‚Çπ20. It wasn't even half a glass, had very litte salt and the garlic taste was completely missing. All i could taste was chillies and chaat masala. Wont order solkadi from here ever."
"Shoddy and rude service. Stale, totally tasteless prawn pulao served under the guise of today's special. Have visited the place twice following a friend's recommendation. Disappointing visit the first time, nevertheless we visited again today for the quintessential second chance, and came back doubly disappointed. There are going to be no attempts at third time lucky. Malvan katta never again. One star because there's no option of a zero rating."
"A very disappointing meal today. The board proclaimed Prawn Pulav as the day's special. What was served was barely warm Pulav that looked and tasted like yesterday's leftovers refrigerated and then turned over again today. The were burnt bits of rice, no steam, no aroma, pasty prawns and lots of broken rice, what one gets when you turn over cooked rice over and over again.

The mandeli and bombil fry was crisp and tasty. Gravies were smooth and Wade well fried. The Pulav was a disaster and the staff and manager couldn't care less."
Go for the fish love .. super homely food .. ambience is simple which makes the food more of a grandma-made-thing. Chiken is nt recommended. Fish thalis are worth it !
"Authentic Malwani food! They feed you like your mother, they'll spoil you with both Taste and quantity, only for you to wanting to go back again! Such a homely feeling with amazing diner service, helpful and honest staff. Definitely try their Prawns Biryani but beware, there might be an explosion on your tastebuds and your mouth might love it ! Any of the Fry's and gravy's are worth another infinite visit to this place. Kudos to the chef !!!"
"I‚Äôve been visiting this place since I was 4-5 years old.
The quality of food has always been great. Fresh fish food in great prices. If you have taste buds like me the this is one place you need to visit atleast once. If you have not eaten fish before, start with Surmay or Halva. Then move on to Prawns, Bombil, Tisrya etc"
"I actually am biased towards seafood and this place has one of the best and most fresh seafood available on its menu.. so malvani is anyway one of my fav cuisines and this place excels in it totally. In addition to the fixed menu, they have a daily menu that's to look out for. And don't be disappointed cause there are days when things mentioned in the mail menu will also not be available. They concentrate on the fresh catch of the day and don't believe in serving frozen meat. Also do expect a queue whenever you arrive, I've never got a table right away here.

Coming to the ambience, a simple place that ideally fits into the definition of GHARGUTI (just like home).. the food is humble and...read more"
Food is very good in quality bt shuld definately look out for quantity...especially in chicken biryani...The Next time i would visit we would definately try for promphret fry its too good...
"Awesome Malvani thali. Try solkadhi for sure. Clean place and more of homely touch. Go for an experience Malvani food.

Bhakri, Thali, Solkadhi"
"Horrible taste... we are fish eater people and we asked for a surmai fry thali costing 320/- and the fish given was not surmai... they were not ready to evn accept this...the appereance of ths fish was not at all like surmai and evn the taste. Even the colour was not pure white as it should b for a fresh surmai
I do not recommend this type of seafood place to any1."

Drank: none

Taste: 2.5/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5 (This place is actually a ground floor apt converted into a restaurant. Its interesting to sit here but nothing really in ambience that would call me again)

Serving style: 3/5 (Strictly ok)

Price: 4/5 (it isn't cheap)

Overall experience: 2.5/5

Will I go again: Nope

Any particular: The vade were really thick and cold which made them chewy. And pomfret was also quiet cold. I was surprised that for such a busy restaurant they had cold food.

"August 2018

A friend insisted I try this place to cherish my new found love for malvani food! This place serves food enriched with authentic malvani flavours. Known for its fish Thalis and chicken preps, I ordered chicken masala and sukka! Both were amazing with respect to taste, texture and quantity! Sukka does have some thick gravy so it's not totally a dry prep. You can have both these dishes with pav too as the masala has a little runny consistency. They generally deliver if your order is Rs.300 or more!"
"This is a superb place to visit, it serves you authentic Maharashtrian food which is really tasty and the cost is comparatively less and the quality is great. It is a good restaurant for family dinners and the Ambience is good, you have to wait in a queue because the hotel is almost full every time I have seen. Overall it is a best place to have non veg in authentic style."
This place is excellent. I loved the food so much. This place is worth of everything. No compromise on taste and quality. Satisfaction at it's best. Service was excellent. I'll suggest everyone to visit this place.üëå‚ù§Ô∏è
"The kebab masala was interesting (it was a Friday special) but somehow the seekh kebabs in the gravy seemed a tad bit overdone. The mutton fry was lacking in Salt & the bhakris were at room temperature & not hot. I want to give this place another chance but I think I‚Äôll probably try another place instead. They didn‚Äôt have many fish on the menu available & honestly, their thalis were not that impressive. Dadar & Lalbaug has some good Malwani food. Their fried prawns had a nice crunch but I feel like their food quality overall was highly average. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Malwani food & this is honestly not one of the better Malwani food experiences I have had."
"Food is too Good. Taste was excellent. Authentic malvani food at very reasonable price. I ordered Surmai Fry Thali... It had 2 Big Fish Fry Pieces with Fish curry ( Goan Style) , also little Sambar, with Bhakari / Roti / Vade ( As per your req.), some dry Chuttni, Rice and Solkadhi....All at just Rs. 310....which is freaking awesome.... Staff is also good...

But to get a seat their u need to have patience... Since it was Sunday... It was heavily crowded but they manage it properly.. But after all its Worth..

Thanks to Acharekar Family."

The authentic setting (with a giant fish net to set the mood) is perfect place to savour true malvani cuisine. The service is super quick and the price economical compared to other nearby outlets. Go there the next time ur in mood for fish fry malvani style!!"

"One place a sea food lover should never miss. Food quality and freshness of fish is just amazing. Try to go there early to get your best catch before it gets over. All fish fish fry‚Äôs, Solkadi etc are great, Zawla bhakri also has astonishing flavours. I would not recommend having chicken here as you should not miss out on something that they are best in making. Not that easy to find the place, but yes once you find it, you end up going there quiet frequently."
