I recently visit here with my mom and we try chicken with chilli oil and spring onion and it‚Äôs too yummy I just loved it super yummy and totally worth it .
"there was hair in the salmon roll. the presentation was horrible, as if ive ordered from a sidey shitty restaurant. the salmon tasted and smelled stale. im so unimpressed, for the prices we're paying i expect quality. the prawn dumplings had a slimey texture on the top. the edemame dumplings were so extra dry. the quality control was clearly not upto the mark. horrible."

"Mr. Ganesh ruined my family dinner tonight. In spite of clearly telling him to ensure there were no mushrooms in our meal because I am allergic, the Thai Green Curry had more mushrooms then chicken pieces in it, this I noticed as soon as I bit into one piece of mushroom, which has ultimately affected me.

Thank you for a horrible meal, Mr. Ganesh"
