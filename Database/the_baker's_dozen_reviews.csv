Bread loaf was in-even & un-baked properly to make slices of it. Ruined my dinner. Lost total faith on the bakers dozen & delivery partner Zomato. Un-acceptable.
"Came at 9.23
Payment made at 8.23"

"Christmas Cake was old and did not have a rum flavour or authentic experience. Disappointed as we have been ordering this item from Bakers 12 for the past two years.

It either sent me a dated product or cut corners in the recipe."
"the banana walnut cake is splendid, perfect taste and texture. one of the best i have tried soo far"

brioche loaf is not as soft as it used to be. rest of the items are amazing
The product was stale and tasted flat

The banana walnut cake is just so perfect."

loved it
First outlet of bakers dozen and pav which is different and delicious
Amazing ðŸ¤©
One of the best baked goods out there. Love itt. Highly recommended
Looks like it's now a habit with Bakers Dozen to send stake bread when you order 3-4 packs from them at once. Very disappointing for the kind of premium prices that they charge! I ordered 4 pcs of multigrain loaf and all of them came with an expiry date of day after tomorrow itself!
good product

Too salty. Very very bad
the expiration date is on the day of order itself

burnt load
