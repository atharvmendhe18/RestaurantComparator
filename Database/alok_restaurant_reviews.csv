"Located just a couple minutes from Thane station, this restaurant is a perfect spot for a quick meal before a journey. Hence, you'd find a lot of family crowd who stop by here before or after a trip.
Our personal favourite is the masala dosa and tea combo. The dosa is enough for one with loads of masala inside. The white chutney is so good that you're bound to ask for more! The tea has the perfect of milk and tea leaves.
Coming to the Chinese cuisine, we love the classic Veg Crispy which indeed does justice to the name. A mixture of vegetables tossed in schezwan sauce fried to a crispy perfection. They also offer fresh juices and other beverages.

"Nice service and nice food available there
Daal khichdi
Chass
Panner mattar
Roti butter
Ambiance very nice
Lighting content are very simple"
Service is very slow.. Ambiance is clumsy and food is also not upto the mark as compared to prices they are charging.
"One of the place in Thane which serves good Pav bhaji. Also I like the tea here...it is too good
Must try for Tea lover"

"One of the old restaurants in Thane - Alok Restaurant is located at a very prime location near to Thane Station thus attracts a lot of daily commuters. The restaurant has a huge seating area, the ambience is pretty basic.

This place is famous for its Pav Bhaji thus we ordered special pav bhaji which was loaded with cheese & dry fruits. The special pav bhaji was yummy but I personally like normal pav bhaji for its authentic taste.

The service was quick & the menu was rightly priced.üòä

Special Pav Bhaji - 140 Rs.üôÇ

"A week ago visited this hotel. This is located near Thane railway station. 

Place is nice but staff does not take order properly. I ordered Puri bhaji as i was getting late to catch my train, but staff serve me wrong food, i have to wait for 12-15 minutes more for them to make my order correct and serve me.

Food taste was normal but puri was oily. Hotel maintained its Hygiene well.

once a while recommended to go!!"

"Jus near to Thane Station, and hence very popular restaurant for having fast food and breakfast. Good quality of food and punjabi dishes :) Nice place to go out with friends and family for dinner outing.
Hygiene is quite ok and can be improved.."
"This is a decent restaurant situated close to the Thane railway station. It is one of the oldest too. There are 3 sections for sitting.. one is the non AC outside section.. however try abiding this unless you are in a hurry or want a quick grab because the continuous smell of the tadka and the pavbhaji might trouble you, second is the non AC basement section.. tall purple, please mind your head here. Third is the AC section situated in the upper half floor. Taste of food is good and hygiene is ok.
They deliver exclusively over Zomato."

I have been going here since my childhood. Dosas over here are awesome. Very close to Thane station. Nice place for a quick snack and for lunch as well. Highly recommend this place. Had butter masala Dosa yesterday which reminded me of my childhood days.
"We tried the Alok Restaurant for the first time last night and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. The waiters were attentive and service overall was good. The restaurant looked to have been nicely decorated. Overall a good meal and great value."
Cool place to visit with quick snacks n meet up with buddies n colleagues at the Pre location in thane.. cozy place peaceful place .. to discuss work n chit chat .. good food and quick service ..
"Brilliant tastes
Classy service
Hygiene place
Can enjoyed with families, friends, meetings etc....
This pizzas will snatch your waters from your mouth and smash it on the food to tastefully taste it.
Veg. chesse pizza
Only cheese pizza
Bothe of them taste super
Sufficient and enough to blow away your hunger...."
"The service here is always great though its a bit slow. It is one of the oldest and well known restaurants in and around thane and is situated not far the station. The place is popular mostly for its south indian food and chinese cuisine. Other snacks here are also good in taste. The cheese grilled sandwich is amazing in taste. The triple schezwan rice is also good in taste. Its a little spicy though. Puri bhaji and pav bhaji are also good. Overall, its a good place to dine at as its hygienic and food taste good with reasonable prices.
Food - 4/5
Service -5/5

"Good place for quality food at best price and can visit again. Location is walkable from station.
Peak hours little crowded. Interior has to be improved little but compare the price it is ok."
Though the place is good food wise also it is good to go but service is bit slow and also the food can be improved more. But masala tea is just an exception here it is very good. Do give it a try.
I love this restaurant. Maybe it's not the best as such. But it's definitely one of best. The service is quick. Food quality and taste are on point. And the best part is that they're very hygienic and affordable as well. This restaurant is also very easy to locate as it's just 2 mins walking distance from Thane station (West). This restaurant is good for short outings with family/colleagues.
"This place is 2 mins from thane station
Very good ambience
Food is delicious we usually visit there
Quality and quantity is good at
Affordable prices"
This a pure veg hotel at the corner of street and very much near to Thane Station. They serve Khichdi which is good in taste but they don't serve papad along with it. While other restaurants do serve papad with their Khichdi.
This restaurant is located near thane station. The food here is tasty. I went with my friends. I ordered masla dosa and it was sooooo yummy and also the sambar is super delicious. As it is very close to station you can visit over there anytime. We had ordered different dishes and all were tasty. Would like to visit again.
Today the delivery was on time and Zomato informed the updates as well. Food was tasty and portions were also adequate.
I did not receive the extra pav I ordered with the pav bhaji. :( Rest of the order was good. Quantity n taste matched with what is served at the hotel.
"I have been visiting this place for years now and It has stayed the same since my first visit over a decade ago.

Very good place for a quick bite right next to the Thane Railway station (West). Food is tasty and well prepared. Service is good and staff are polite as well.

Only thing is that this place definitely needs a makeover for ambience. I feel that they are at a prime location and have definite scope to improve."
"A very old restaurant. Its more of a landmark now. The service is quick. Food is good, decent place to have your meal. Rates are reasonable. I had a Thali which was quite filling. It is a pure vegetarian restaurant. Decent ambience, you can have food with your family and friends."
"If you visit this place, please do not forget to try out their pav bhaji. It is next level delicious!
Pocket friendly place with a decent ambiance.
Must visit!"
"Alok restaurant is simply located at Naupada near thane station, yesterday I visited here.Here I had dosa and pay bhaji.. they provide a good quality of food and taste of food is also good. Cost of food is not much high. And ambience is also quite good.

"Really a descent hotel if you are near Thane Railway Station and a pure vegetarian...and not willing to waste too much time searching for hotel...There many dishes on offer but in the end u should not miss on is ""Chaas"" they have...
Really original taste of Chaas I got here !!!!"
Restaurant is located in very prime location and near to station so it is convenient to visit. Good place for quick meetings. AC and non AC restaurant is there. We ordered veg kolhapuri it was tasty but little bit oily
"Alok Restaurant!

One of the oldest restaurants in Thane. Situated just near Thane station. So it is very easily accessible.

They have a huge sitting area. The staff is not so helpful at times and service is okay.

This place has been famous for its Pav Bhaji!
Being a huge Pav Bhaji lover I had to try out the Pav Bhaji here. I had to say a thing the Pav Bhaji here tasted heavenly but over the years the quality and quantity both have degraded a lot. The prices are also very high now which is not good.

#tastentell"
"Nice place to got when u really hungry üòã

I mean Indian foods are really tasty and in good quantity. Few steps from Thane railway station attracts a lot of daily commuters.

Snacks, tea and coffee are good as per price.

But remember never ever try Chinese foods here. After eating Chinese here you will surely hate Chinese thereafter.üòü

Hygiene - 2/5
Service - 3/5

Ambience is good.. decent and hygienic place.. food i like in here is pav bhaji and daal tadka zeera rice.. i often visit this place only for these two things.. i would recommend..
"I always visit this place for south Indian delicacy. The medu vada here is just awesome, with full of crispyness and the perfect sambar with it."
"Serves really tasty onion-tomato uttapa,pav bhaji n dosa...one of my favourite place near station road..service is fast...ambience is not that good though..but good food covers up for that"
"worst experience.. not recommended food is worst and staff is too much worst

it can cancel order any time
staff and owner use bad word for customer"
"I loved pav bhaji in alok restaurant. Its classic interior is really cool to have your meal. For breakfast,South Indian food is famous in alok."
"‚ô®This place is located near thane station. During peak hours its completely crowded place.

"Never heard about this place, but while passing through this place, we decided to give it a try. We went for the Ac section because the normal one was noisy. The Ac's were not working well and killed the whole vibe. We ordered for the Manchow soup. It was a decent one. Not bad.
For main course, we ordered butter naan and paneer. It was too yumm. Blame it on our hungry stomachs or the yummy food, we were completely full. We did regret ordering the Veg dum biriyani since we were already full. But it was yumm. They gave us chole alongwith it. They do have to improve and change the interiors. All this costed around 600rs . Also, the glass in which they served water was unclear . The waiters...read more"
"I went to this place with my sister and we ordered gobi manchurian and fried rice. We expecting a decent meal but apparently you cannot even expect that anymore. My sister specially requested that the manchurian needs to be crisp and dry. However, it was wet and soggy. When we complained to the waiter, he just walked off and brought the manager who was very rude to us. He didn't replace the badly made dish and kept on making ridiculous explanations for this dud of a dish. I am severely disappointed."
"I had heard a lot of praise for their pav bhaji hence decided to visit on a Saturday afternoon. The place is right opposite Thane railway station and is almost always crowded.

I found the place to be extremely understaffed and unhygienic. We were sitting in the AC section which was hardly any cooler than outside. It took them more than 15 mins to send someone to take our order and another 45 mins to serve our pav bhaji. The drinks we had ordered were served after we finished half of our pav bhaji :-(

The pav bhaji didn't taste like anything. It was clearly prepared hastily. Regretted the decision of visiting this place big time."
A budget friendly restaurant For Lunch and dinner with Familyü§ü They need to improve their service. Staff is very Lame and lazy But food is good which gave us satisfaction ü§ü
"Tried south indian here was good enough loves their sambar
North indian was also good enough
Good to visit for lunch or dinner
Chinese was Ok
This is always full"
"Best option for short meetings, Simple and tasty food. It's near from Thane station. All type of food they serve but I mostly prefer aloo paratha with chanch üòçü§ò"
"This restaurant is at walkable distance from thane station.
Good option for thalis.
Fast service.
Home delivery available
Good place to have lunch or dinner."
Decent food and good service. I would not recommend this place for ambience. The non-AC section is very noisy because it's at the station. Also there is a lot of pollution outside. The AC section is better but the place is very old and definitely needs renovation.
"As it was known for its glorious name , Just visited the place today but it is no more glorious. I had a very bad experience with food, service, ambience and hygeine. Waiter's are very rude and their hygeine is the worse that u can ever think of. I had veg . Kolhapuri which actually tasted lyk some blunt veg masala with uncooked french beans and peas. I would never like to visit this place again."
The food is ok. Not too great not too bad just ok food. If you sit inside in the ac room then its okay but if not then lots of pollution and noise of vehicles as it is opposite to the busiest railway station and crowded roads . Ordered South Indian snacks like dosas and idlis.
"One of the most iconic hotels in this city although it is now only a shadow of its past glory ! It must be almost 25 years since Alok hotel became operational and instantly was hugely popular and most of the times always full.

It enjoys a very strategic location on the busy junction just outside Thane station, which is also the main reason for its popularity even now although the overall quality of food n service has gone down over the years.

It has three levels including an AC section which is comparatively much more comfortable.

The menu is typical Udupi food plus other popular items like pav bhaji, paneer dishes, etc.

The most ordered dishes here are ofcourse the South indian...read more"
Food was average. The staff was inattentive. The hygiene is pathetic as u can find cockroaches every where from table to wash basin. I would never visit this restaurant again.
Pathetic food. Bad ambience. It has become worse than a roadside redi. I wish there was 0. 5 rating. Thalia had all vegetables which were leftover
"World's worst restaurant
Sandwiches are sooooo dry and I'm paying 60 rs for it which is NOT WORTH IT.
Medu wadas are really oily and thali was so cold even though I was sitting in the non AC room an
1.0 stars only because of the ice cream and NOTHING ELSE
Totally Over rated"
Simple...sober...old restaurant of Thane..my favourite...veg pulav..not so spicy...but dey dont accept Sodexo coupons now. Near to Thane stn.
"First of all, waiting service is worst that they serve. They served Glass of water after 15mins that also when we asked about that. Dishes were uncleand and oily. We showed it to manager, he told us that its sunday so we dnt clean it properly.
Bislery Bottle prise is 20 rs bt they hv added extra money. Wen we asked dat y u r adding extra charges, if we r paying CGST AND SGST then u hv to sell it at printed prise. He said do complaint if u want

"Generally while taking a share rickshaw to Ghodbunder I often spot this resto tucked in corner. Never tried it before but yesterday something unsual happened. Due to shortage of rickshaws, I was consantly going to and fro from one corner to other. And in meantime it just bought some aroma of pav-bhaji, to my nostrils. It slipped past my body, making me unconscious and in no time I started craving for pav-bhaji!
Taking few minutes, (every minute has changed its magnitude to hours) the waiter arrives with my order. And it was healthy enough to satisfy all my hawas created that day. And the cheese grated on top.. Uff.. was a reward to it."
"A very bad experience all together!
I was sitting at the restaurant waiting for my friend when suddenly some group of jerks(5 people) sat at the same table, even though there was plenty of tables available around. They were eyeing me unpleasantly and at my yelling only they left. There were people around noticing the scene no one commented a thing. When my friend was back we went to argue with the manager that how indecent such a thing to happen in a public restaurant, a girl is sitting alone and without any decent courtesy such thugs just comes and stares her weirdly. To which the manager only replied ""madam sharing pe hota hai table"" without helping or looking into the...read more"
0.5 less for poor staff assistance. But the food is awesome.. Best place in Thane to have south indian dishes.. I always have MASALA DOSA & WADA SAMBHAR. Masala dosa is awesome and tastes delicious.. sometime Wada sambhar is raw and not well fried. But thats once in blue moon.. Most of the time all your dishes are satisfying and tasty.. Had a good lunch here with my family.. :)
A decent and pocket friendly restaurant right across the busy and crowded than station.. have heard that it's one of the oldest restaurant in the vicinity.. service is good and food is decent.. have got a good variety of food in the menu.. worth a visit ...
"A restaurant just at the perfect location. Even if they don't serve extraordinary food, they'll never be short of customers.
Anyone who stays in Thane, for sure must have visited this place at least once in there lifetime.
Food is decent.
Medu wada is must at this restaurant. You will get the same consistent taste whenever you walk in. Easy on pocket and quick service. Good place for a quick snack."
"Worst service!! The management and the waiters have no idea that customers are there, they have come or they are waiting. They don't have the courtesy to ask or tell ppl abt the waiting time. Secondly, after u finish of with ur food and have half dishes left.. Like half pav bhaji.. Half sabzi.. They won't even parcel that for u despite u are the person paying for it and despite u request them to do so. The 2 points given are only for their food rest all is just bad."
"It's the nearest place to hog from the Thane Station.
The ambiance is similar to normal restaurant. Head up to the AC area for a better feel.
Specially visit here to taste the lip smacking Mysore Masala Dosa!!
The Pav Bhaji is also pretty good here.!"
"Having spent my college days sipping a cup of coffee with the various girls ive dated to having coffee alone while back from work, ive seen this place since 1996

Tried several dishes in the last few years but all have severely disappointed. Only the medu wada sambhar quality has been maintained over the years

Go there if:
1. You need good quality medu wada
2. If you need to spend good undisturbed quality time with your girlfriend (goto the a/c section and order a coffee in a corner)
3. If you friend is late and making you wait at the station

I think the quality needs to be focussed on."
"You cant deny going to this place if you are visiting thane. Just opposite to thane station resides this hotel. Oldest restaurant , here you can get all types of cuisine accompanied with good quality and taste.

Must try Items - Medu vada sambhar, PavBhaji, All north Indian sabji's and Veg Deluxe thali is a must."
"This is typical Indian restaurant located in Thane and you will get a feel of having authentic Indian Ghar Ka Khana here. Ambience wise, the place is spacious and seating arrangement is fine. The hospitality and service is also good. The orders placed are serviced quickly and you don't have to wait for your turn.

Speaking of food, Hara Bhara Kebab in starters were absolutely brilliant. They had good coating and was not too oily. Spring Rolls were also fine with good flavour.

Rotis and Paneer tikka were the best. The panner pieces were big ones and the gravy was was of thick consistency. It had good flavour.

"Fast, reasonable, reliable!

The place has a great location just outside Thane railway station with ample seating space, making it a perfect place for a quick bite. The service is fast and efficient.

We were in a hurry and ordered two cheese pav bhajis and a masala papad. Strangely, the masala papad came without sev - never seen that before. It had a good taste, though it lost out on the crunchiness of the sev. The cheese pav bhaji was quite filling - good quantity of the bhaji with a generous layer of cheese did not leave us wanting seconds. The bhaji itself was not too spicy, oily or heavy, and hence did not give us the heavy, bloated feeling we usually get after lunch. We decided to...read more"
"One of the oldest and well known restaurant in thane. Located near Thane station. They have AC and non AC section. Non AC section is noisy because of roads. Staff and service is good. They need to improve there ambience and hygiene. Snacks and North Indian food is good , rates also reasonable. Don't try Chinese here.
Overall good for food."
Variety of seating arrangement from normal atmosphere to ac room .. service is good .. the breakfast i tried here is good .. south Indian cuisine to chinese food moghlai food with good taste.. reasonable price ..
"Ambience -1 poor ,service - 1 poor ,food -1 ,staff is very rude , unhygienic food with no taste , not worth of price , street food is better than this and atleast worth eating"
Worst experience ever......... You will love Street food but not from here.... Baddddddddddd.................................................
"A veg place standing strong outside thane stn. serving fast food as well as mains... Their Pav Bhaji n dosa is good as well as they are famous for their veg Thalis.

Had a bad experience yesterday when I went in for lunch. Went in the AC section where the service wasn't good. The staff was less their compared to outer sections...
Coming to the food. Ordered a veg and kulchas n roti. The Kulcha was doughy... Not cooked well.. On reporting, the waiter said aisa hi hota hai... Lyk I donno what a kulcha is... So left it.
Ordered a schezwan noodles, which was decent..

Sitting in the outer section is recommended where service is good n fast."
"Alok Restaurant is the oldest hotels in thane and also the good part it is near to station. Visted this place a couple of times. Food is good with good quantity, Service is quick. Try Pav bhaji it is very good."
