"Very disappointed. The Juhu branch has good food. But everything we ordered here was bad. Benedict had a bun instead of a small muffin(which Juhu has), egg was smelly and runny, pizza was also not not that great."
"The only thing good during our dining was the water they served

I had to clean my own seat as it was dusty

The food was abysmal, we ordered 2 things both were disappointing (gnocchi & hot chocolate)

Came here with some expectations, going back disppapointed"

"Amazing food, Sujit was great in recommending dishes. Enjoyed the experience overall!"
Good food and nice ambience
for just 3 km distance you guys took 1 hr n 10 mint ...this is the 3rd time the order was delayed..it's not acceptable at all . pathetic service wasting time unnecessary
"Food is nothing close to what it used to be a few years back. We were a group of 10 so ordered many dishes. 95% of them were disappointing.

Spaghetti was broken and dry- was clearly leftover scraped from bottom of the pan.
Bruschetta was soggy with soggy tomatoes and not so fresh avacados
Quasedillas tasted like sweet paneer toast made at home
Cheese foundue was reduced to white sauce with regular raw storebought bread

Only the Mezze platter and sweet potato salad were something we could actually eat.

We had to ask for plates as they werenâ€™t given to us till after the food was served . Then the lady asked us how many plates should she give.

No idea why such an awesome place (as it...read more"

the pasta was very dry and not upto the mark. the Mashrooms were not enough as expected
"Food was very average from what we had last time except for soup none of the dish were up to standard I.e. maizze platter , bbq pizza"
The food quality is good. The taste is normal. Coffee blend was good. Overall a great place to visit with friends or family. The staff is sweet. The prices for the food are bit on expensive side though.

"raw meat, we couldn't eat"
"Well this is my first time writing a review while sitting in the restaurant & even before having the bill.
They missed our two items from our orders.
Did not even have the courtesy to give basics like tomato sauce, mustard sauce etc. The egg Benedict were served on regular bread & not English muffin. the ham was over cooked in it.
garlic bread was way too salty. fries were stale. highly disappointed and never coming again. they just spoiled my Sunday morning."
"lovely place, amazing food ðŸ˜‹"
"The pasta was cooked well, but the amount of butter that was in it could lead to a clogged artery immediately. I had to scoop out the ravioli so that I donâ€™t go hungry for lunch. They melted a bar of Amul butter on my pasta"
"Had a fun time. The food was really good.

Irish lamb stew-5/5
Teriyaki chicken pizza- 3/5
Apple pie- 4/5

Service can be improved.
Overall good vibes."

"The place is good. Food is delicious,but the resturant really needs to approve lots in service, the trainee staff need not be allowed on the tables. The waiter need to know more about the product available. The washroom were dirty need proper maintenance."
This place is pathetic this one staff was very rude and food was not good except pizza. Terrible experience they should shut down the place

"I had a very bad experience with this restaurant, booked a table through Zomato, reached there on time but the service manager denied accepting Zomato and said booking should be done before minimum two hours.

i.e. booked at 7pm for 8pm, reached there at 8pm but denied accepting Zomato booking.

please be ethnical, Do NOT list your cafe incase if Zomato booking doesn't suits you.
Don't waste anyone's time.

I have noticed similar reviews on Zomato for this restaurant"
veg quedadilla and mushroom soup is complete yuck
chicken was brined a bit too much ..felt like plastic

"The soup quality- peppery lemon was not good ; almost raw carrots, old broccoli and undercooked mushroom"
"The ham sausage pizza was very good. The pizza sauce was spicy and sweet , which was something different but good , overall the pizza was good."

Portion sizes are really small despite charging high rates. It's pathetic ðŸ™„

"The Benedict tenderloin burger was really bad.
The meat was bad/stale. I had it for lunch and in the evening I was throwing up.

Fable, please be careful when serving meats.
Your burgers look so delicious but when you serve it, it is just not fresh."

I ordered the Cesar salad and comparative to the price the portion was not even half the box that they sent ðŸ˜ž.. very disappointed with the portion ..

Edamame was the star
"""I had a disappointing dining experience at fable due to the manager's refusal to switch on all the lights during our meal. This not only made it difficult to enjoy our food but also created an uncomfortable atmosphere. Additionally, the manager's rude attitude when we requested the lights be turned on was unacceptable. It's essential for a hotel to provide a pleasant dining environment and treat guests with respect."""
"there could be more on the pizza , otherwise the pizza was very good , the pizza base was cooked , could be a little more toasted"

Gnocchi was undercooked and the spinach gravy also did not taste as usual.

Meat was tender. The red wine jus was very tasty. Perfect dish and amazing combination of flavours in every bite. If youâ€™re craving a good steak in the city look no further

tiramisu was very sour. cream or cheese had gone bad.

"If you are visiting Fable, try visiting when the weather is cool - that way, you can try the outdoor seating and enjoy the quirky ambiance.

The pizzas are an absolute must try. I went for the Margherita pizza and wow, the cheese pull was phenomenal. The crust to cheese ratio was perfect. To continue with the cheese train, I also tried the Mozzarella sticks which came with a side of salsa. The salsa was an odd condiment for this dish but the mozzarella sticks were great. The Naga Chilli Cheese Toast was splendidly spicy - I requested for extra spice and the kitchen did not disappoint.

The one place of improvement would be the service. While some servers were amazing, others were not so...read more"

"the chicken in the salad was stale and undercooked. The vegetables were not fresh and the dressing was v sweet.
the burger had too many onions which made it sweet. and too much sauce."
"I loved the place. food was served very quickly, fresh and hot. the service was very very good and along with Zomato, we got a great offer that didn't pinch our pockets. family of four, well fed. thank you"

"We visited Fable, Chandivali, after reading the reviews, and well, we should have heeded the negative reviews. I was wondering why there were so few diners there on a Friday evening.
The outside seating area needs a facelift. The lights are garish and too bright, and it seemed as if we are not at a cute cafe, but at a dhaba! The lights are a total mood killer.
The food was average, and pretty mid. Nothing special! In fact, the chicken and avocado salad that I had ordered, was haphazardly tossed, and some of the sauce had overflowed, and sticking to the outside of the bowl.
The spaghetti, and the penne in basil pesto were okay. The drinks (Guava Mary, Mango Mojito, and Watermelon and...read more"
