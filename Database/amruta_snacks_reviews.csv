They Just sent Tomato Pureee Ewww
"Aloo was raw
There were lumps in garvy.
It has really bad taste."
"Pav Bhaji was not having any spices. very much blank taste. Soup was not having adequate ginger & garlic, very much tangy. Rice was dry dry. Manchurian Dry was also tangy, less garlic and ginger. no proper spices , flavour in the dishes.
zero start and do not order again."

Pav bhaji was extremely oily .. couldn’t bare the sight of it
"I ordered 4 paneer tikka masala and in each packet there was only one paneer piece and the whole gravy was given, this is very bad thing for any hotel owner that you charge for paneer and give only gravy . Also it was made too too oily. The same they did for mushrooms. So so bad experience. Unfortunately I couldn’t click the photos.
They are actually fooling the customers"
"Not fresh
Even sandwich bread is also not fresh"
"oily ( no butter but container full of oil,spicy which hits the throat"
"Even after giving instructions as no spicy, this is the 3rd time they have given very spicy pav bhaji . Sandwich was ok."
Ordered the Paneer tikka masala it's very bad taste and Oily . Don't waste your money to order from this restaurant

"i don't like pavbhaji
mujhe omating hue , text bhi pav bhaji ki tarah. nhi hai"
How can restaurant be so careless .I saw the rating and ordered and never advise to order from this restaurant .they spiked most of it and also didn’t send the pav and now we have to go around for searching pav
""
"poor packing issue.
oil out from tin & spred on all packing"

V ordered the famous pav bhaji n it was not like a pav bhaji we would have. Instead of pav bhaji it tasted more like a gravy of a paneer or aloo sabji or veg kolhapuri to b precise. It had lot of garam masala in it. The pav served wer not soft n wen v complained d owner jus ignored n was bothered to take payment. Horrible experience. Never visiting again.
