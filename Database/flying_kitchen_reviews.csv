Review
Worst food ever...no taste nothing..I ordered pepper chicken..restaurant called me up and asked me to change the order as boneless chicken was not available. .then I ordered kadak chicken which was worst chicken I hv ever tasted..no spices nothing..
"I ordered Veg Biryani from Flying Kitchen Kamothe but its Taste was like homemade masala rice, in vegetables only they mix matar and paneer and cook not properly. With biryani only give DAHI.. Not provide rayta.. Cheap Quality. Order is delayed. No any tracking facilities."
Very bad..Taste is really bad..I order twice triple noodles and chicken handi masala...But both the times taste is bad..Do not order from this..
"I just received non-veg platter... Roti was dry and hard and chicken was taste less i ordered kolhapuri chicken and its bends kolhapur...
üòï"
Mushroom Green Ghee Roast could have been made with spinach leaves instead of spinach gravy. Gravy makes the dish more main course rather starter. Otherwise taste is good.
I have ordered Biryani... chicken was half cooked... can't eat at all very disappointing... please don't be in hurry to send order...we want it to eat not to waste...I couldn't eat it...I tried to recooked again on Gas but instead of chicken getting cooked ...rice became dry
it was good üëçüëçüëç
"i ordered chicken chilly and chicken manchow soup test is not good so much salt and soya souce ... quantity was less... this time your food test very bad... but last time i ordered your food test good...
but this time not good..."
"We ordered 2 meals, Indian veg meal and Chinese veg meal. Got the order on time thanks to Zomato but the food was pathetic and awful. For the Indian meal we were suppose to get rotis and we didn't get it, rice was under cooked.
Secondly the Chinese Manchurian was stinking badly. The gravy was very bad. No veggies in Hakka noodles and what not.
Later on they compensated by giving us biryani which was ok.
Overall experience very bad. Hence giving 1 star."
"faltu Service,order lene ke bad Cancel kar dete hai"
food was a bit uncooked but aas tasty... they can make sure about it being cooked properly
kheer wasn't sweet.
food was very salty
Good service
sorry to say but can not prepare chicken tikka masala. paneer chili was ok.
Very poor food quality
The chicken was bit undercooked. Teast of the food was ok. Quantity of the food was decent. Food was not overly spiced. I will recommend you to try it once.
"Food is actually good but delivery wasn't good , All the food is mixed at delivery time , and the meal is found dropping at carry bag."
"Ordered chicken kolhapuri with butter rotis, and a complimentary portion of lassi.

Chicken kolhapuri was really good and tasty, quantity was good too. Rotis were big, nice and soft. Lassi wasn't good enough though, felt like I was drinking srikhand.

Overall it was really great, and would love to order again soon."
"Ordered Green Peas masala...received some paneer item instead...
Also the so called phirni was no where near Phirni..the phirni contained whole rice in warm milk...These guys did not even provide the invoice for the said order...
Full waste of money...and when called and inform the same to the restaurant, they did not even had the courtesy to apologise..
Not recommened guys....
I wished there were negative points for review.."
Not so good
Bad service bad food
all was good except the 300y/o gulab jamun
non veg meal send without any salad no onion no lemon.... tandur chicken send without any charni
very bad quality food starters were burnt sweet was completely cheap quality and worst taste if you need good food and better quantity choose different restaurant
"the quantity was a little less, n did not pay attention to special mentions."
"2nd time flying kitchen disappointed me
schezwan sause was too sarr

Chinese Non veg Meal.
Packaging:Comes in a plate..very nice.
First time there was chicken in gravy this time only gravy. No chicken.

The sabji had less salt
Food is good...but packing is very loose...materials came out....very disappointing.

Tasty food

"We got food delivered by zomato. We ordered:
1. Chicken Masala
2. Roti
3. Chicken Lollipop
Chicken Masala tasted really good and Roti was perfect but Chicken lollipop was a total disaster..was not happy with it.
Delivery was quite on time. Cost was reasonable."
not the best in Chinese cusine
"We ordered Murg Mussalam, Paneer Tikka Masala,Naan & Roti.Order came in before estimated time of delivery and food was steaming hot.Both the dishes were equally tasty.So when you got no time to cook at home make should to order from Flying Kitchen.
‚úîÔ∏èFood delivery hub Approved ‚úîÔ∏è"
perfect
Ordered food... Paid the amount...... The amount got deducted from my account... But didn't get the food... So I no longer need this app.......
When butter garlic starter is mistaken as roasted/burnt garlic 'topping'. DON'T PUT IT ON THE MENU IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT!!!!!
what hell have I received. the lemon water is hot. can't even call it warm or not cold. ok accepted it was with biryani. the lemon was is nothing but just plain water. it tastes horrible. biryani is raw. I threw half the thing because the chicken was raw. kindly refund me my money.
U should work on fried rice.
nice
Cooking instructions were not followed.
very poor coupon was aplied but not discounted
good food but sweet was not that good....

"Food was not up to the mark.
I ordered
1) 1 paneer hundi and
2) 1 paneer burji

1) paneer hundi :- The gravy was over cooked, it supposed to be a bit red but unfortunately it wasn't. the panner cubes were little too small. The quantity was fare.

2) paneer burji :- There was so much oil on the top that the oil was coming out from the container. The burji was dry.

The food was not properly packed."
