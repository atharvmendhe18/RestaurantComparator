The portion size was not enough. The taste of food was awful. It was very spicy that barely anyone can have it. Unfortunately I have to dump it. The pieces were not properly cooked. It was not worth the order.

"While passing through Marol on a Sunday, we spontaneously decided to have lunch at Apna Dhaba. Our order included the Apna Chicken Dhaba Gravy paired with some tandoori roti, and I must say, it was exceptional. As a group of three, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Both the quantity and taste were impressive. We also tried the boneless mutton Biryani, which was equally tantalizing. The food struck a perfect balance in flavor‚Äîsufficiently seasoned without being overly spicy, allowing the distinct taste of each spice to shine through. It was a delightful dining experience, and we are certainly planning a return visit."
We ordered 1 cheese garlic naan and 1 butter garlic naan‚Ä¶.but they forgot to add cheese. Very annoying.
The chicken stinks bad
"Damn Expensive, Pathetic Portion Size. Not for a person who is on budget. The items are very less in portion size. Please refrain from buying here."

"Apna Dhaba Family Restaurant & Bar is located at Chakala junction, close to JB Nagar metro station in the heart of Andheri business district. They serve Indian and Chinese select authentic cuisines. The menu is delicately orchestrated with contemporary recipes.

They have large space with multiple dining halls. All the dining halls are well decorated with comfortable seating arrangements.

The food served is authentic and delicious. The dishes are skillfully assembled retaining the authentic flavor, texture and taste.

We tried:

‚ô¶Ô∏èStrawberry Queen
‚ô¶Ô∏èPrawns Tawa Fry
‚ô¶Ô∏èRawas Tandoori
‚ô¶Ô∏èMutton Bhuna Gosht

"Recently visited Apna Dhaba at Andheri E which is at walkable distance from JB Nagar metro station. They have huge dining area with good ambiance. The staff here is hardworking. Coming to the food we ordered:

Virgin mojito: its a healthy refreshing non alcoholic drink made up of simple syrup, fresh lime juice, soda water and fresh mint.

Virgin Colada:- its a simple yet refreshing drink as it has mixture of Pineapple juice, and Coconut cream. It tasted wonderful from the very first sip.

In food I recommend

‚àÜ Chicken Tandoori
‚àÜ Chicken Malai Tikka
‚àÜ Chicken kolhapuri with bread

Overall experience was to good. I loved the taste of food."
Jade Soup is a must try!
"Yummy Food, They served so well to 44 team members, Reasonable as well."

Chilli chicken sent ( green color)is different from what is displayed( orange/ red color) ..also the taste is stale. Never expected this from Apna Dhaba. Total waste of money.
The cost of food was quite high
""
very good üëç service
I ordered 2 plain kulcha but I had received 1 kulcha in the package
"Biryani was stale, my kid vomited after eating it"

Not worth for money ‚Ä¶ very expensive
The food is always delicious & in time I love Apna Dhaba team.
Highly recommend for Chinese
"There were cockroaches and mosquitoes all over
Staff is very rude
Food quality is really bad
We ordered pineapple raita and it was bitter

If it was possible i would rate this place in minus"
"I don‚Äôt have pictures of the ambience or the food because, they weren‚Äôt worth clicking! I and my family kept sending the food back! The curd was smelly, tomato soup wasn‚Äôt fresh and tasted more like tomato water. Basically, the food wasn‚Äôt fresh at all. There were so many mosquitoes that I had to get up in between my meal and walk so that I don‚Äôt itch! Veg was replaced by non-veg & vice versa. What if the veg person would have eaten the non veg food? There was cockroach on my table and my god, that‚Äôs the worst. Either they should shut down the place and have it re-launched or shut it completely because, it‚Äôs not these guys ka cup of tea !!!!"
Portion size for gravies is insufficient even for one person
when I am dining this place food was very tasty that's why I order it today I know is so far for me but still I am order but today food is not tasty not good is like okay okay
"Rice is smells badly, its taste yuk. Complete food wastage."
Poor food quality... Too much salt in everything...Highly disappointing..
The portion size has reduced drastically over the last few months for some reason. While the rates are at par with market the quantity has to be better.
""
it was too Salty.. and the portion size was too less for the amount that i paid for ... I am seeking for the refund because I didn't eat it due to it being too salty
"spicy bola but nhi kiya, no taste very bad"

Pathetic service and poor food quality. Even the basic starters take long time to serve. French fries took literally 30 mins. Veg clear soup was smelling awful and overall I would never recommend this place.
