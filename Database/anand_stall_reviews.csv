not great.. less salt. less spice.. wasnt great either vada pav or the frankie.
Do not waste your money on both the above items. Cold and stale vadaa and frankie roti not chewable. Couldnâ€™t eat both. Thanks

food quality is good but they never Give SAMBHAR with Dosa even after asking and also the way they Pack dosa is worse you cant eat it properly bcs they fold n pack it hot so when it reaches its very badðŸ˜ž Any way Taste wise its good need little extra cheese for Sandwich ! Good food
