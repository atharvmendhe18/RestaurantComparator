"I had visited recently the service is very good no doubt but the food definitely needs a lot of improvement it has gone very downgrade last I had visited was around 3 years back the food was good then but this time the quality wasn’t that great.The starters were cold and hard and I asked for a fresh starter to be made from inside which was just ok nothing great although the pizza was nice the taste of food has also gone for a toss.the good part was the variety of deserts but being a 5 star hotel food quality shall be improved .
Thanx"
"The overall dining experience at the buffet was disappointing. While the food quality was passable, the taste fell short of expectations. Dessert options were limited and appeared stale. The chaat counter had expired yogurt, and the salad seemed to have gone off. Honestly, it wasn't an enjoyable experience, and I would not recommend it."
"Love for Mexican food?? Then this place is perfect for you 😍 I visited pondicherry cafe in Sofitel for dinner and there was a Mexican fest going on ✨ Tried multiple cuisines and loved each and every one 💯 Don't forget to try out their desserts 🍪🎂🍪
From ambience, food, taste, quality, music and hospitality, everything was just top notch🎂💯
Brownie points for hospitality and courteous staff!!

Heads from my side to this place and I am sure you are gonna love it 💜"
Excellent Food. Great Service Given by Dhrumil.
"ZERO STAR SERVICE - ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING.

We went there to celebrate the 90th birthday of my aunt and very unfortunately it just turned out to be a very bad decision, purely due to the extremely Rude, and unwelcoming service.

It was actually shocking to recieve such an attitude from a brand which prides itself in its service.

To start with, Anagha at the restaurant seemed most uninterested to give us a table although we could see many options. Eventually Prith who was the only managerial staff with some decency assured us that he will organise the table on a few minutes which he promptly did.

After the order was taken, the food was served in random order where Noodles we're served...read more"
Great place to be
Freshly squeezed juice in the rate card was Rs 350 but the restaurant charged Rs 450 and had to reverse. Patrons need to check billing details.
"One of the best place near Dadar station to dine-in with family and friends. Special mention to Mr. Parshuram Barik who served us very well. The service was promt and the food was delicious. We tried a lot of food items here but special recommendations to their iconic cocktail Gas Explosion which was great. It was served in a small ‘gas cylinder’ which actually gives the feeling of gas explosion. Our waiter suggested to try us their very famous chatpata chicken fry. We tried and it was amazing. We loved the taste. Also a special recommendation to try their iconic chocolate Gol-Gappe with rabdi shots.
I will suggest this as the best place near dadar railway station if you want to...read more"
Amazing spread for the buffet. The desserts are not to be missed! And brownie points because they are so very accommodating and go out of their way for children. It's always been a pleasure dining here.
Rates are slightly on a higher side
Excellent! Food is a work of art- beautiful presentation and attentive service.
Our servers Sujit and Tanay were amazing and made sure we were taken care of perfectly. Made my birthday special 🥰

"Celebrated my most special day at Pondicherry Cafe and it was an absolute delight! The buffet spread was amazing - ranging from indian cuisine to asian cuisine to italian cuisine, the count going upto 170 items. A must recommend for buffet lovers!"

Pondicherry Cafe is mainly Indian and Asian food focussed restaurant. Buffet spread is good. Salads and desserts spread is huge. plenty of veg and non veg options available.

"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

Just had the pleasure of experiencing the Sunday brunch buffet at Pondicherry Cafe in Bandra Sofitel, bkc, and I must say, it was an exquisite culinary journey! As a food blogger, I've witnessed many spreads, but this surpassed expectations. 🌏

Each dish was not just a treat to the taste buds but a visual masterpiece as well. The artful presentation of the food added to the entire ambiance. 🍣 The Asian section, especially the sushi, was meticulously crafted with fresh ingredients, resembling edible art.

The Indian selection, with classics like biryani, various paneer dishes and indian curries, took me on a nostalgic trip while dazzling with its presentation....read more"
"Loved...Loved....Loved... the food, the ambience, the warmth, the care, the attention and I can keep going on and on....Sofitel Pondicherry Cafe has our heart ❤️

I had reserved spots for a family dinner to celebrate my son Vedant's 18th birthday yesterday 19th August. My experience from booking to billing was seamless beyond expectations.

Infact I want to begin appreciating the love, care, attention and lots of warmth by the team members who left no stone unturned to service us. Tanmay helped me book and assured to make it special for my son. He lived by his words and I was amazed by his hospitality and gesture. Rohit was assigned to us at table 28 and he was just FAB..haven't...read more"

"Brunching Experience Redefined - Pondicherry Cafe located in Sofitel BKC offers you exactly this luxurious experience!

We visited them for a Sunday Brunch and were absolutely impressed with the multi cuisine offerings in the buffet.

One can indulge in Continental cuisine which had delicacies like Slow cooked Duck, Rosemary Chicken Legs, Seabass & my personal favorite - New Zealand Lamb Chops 🐑🍗

A separate section dedicated to Ramen lovers with options of veg, chicken & seafood 🦞🦀🦐🦑 to choose from.

Salad & Hummus section was again something to relish.

Live counters for Pizza & Pasta with order prepared piping hot and served at your table to be enjoyed.

the food was great however the flies in the restaurant did spoil the mood. placing a ventillation or exhaust system over the Mohammad Ali counter would be great as vegetarian would not find the excessive smell pleasant

"The Buffet spread was impressive. The service was excellent. But one of the Veg salad items & Chicken momo were having a foul smell. After complaining about the same we were told that this is the natural smell of the said items.
Though I liked the other food items and the service I don't think I will come here again. The Buffet price is almost more than 4k pp so I don't expect this quality issue and the attitude of the manager who tried to defend by saying that the smell is the natural one."

"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the recent dining experience I had at the Pondicherry Cafe in Sofitel Hotel. As a regular patron of luxury establishments, I had high expectations for a seamless and enjoyable dining experience. Unfortunately, my visit to your restaurant left much to be desired.

First and foremost, the service provided by your staff was exceptionally slow, lethargic, and unorganized. It seemed as though there was a lack of coordination among the employees, leading to a significant delay in serving the food. This unnecessary wait time was not only frustrating but also highly inconvenient, especially when hosting guests.

Speaking of the delay, the...read more"
We went for a lunch buffet on Saturday and it was so bad and not worth the money the food here is very average and very tasteless really disappointing food. Each and every item of the buffet was really tasteless. Being a five star hotel the paneer quality was very bad
