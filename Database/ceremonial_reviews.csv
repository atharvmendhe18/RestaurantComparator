kothimbir wadi is smelling - very bad in taste
"I have ordered from this restaurant after seeing all the positive reviews
I ordered chicken fried rice and veg noodles.
Both tasted good.
My best pick here is chicken fried rice you will never regret it. For every spoon ful of rice you may get atleast one chicken piece.
Prices are little high but I don't know whether these are true restaurant prices or not because I ordered from Zomato"

"I had ordered egg biryani..
