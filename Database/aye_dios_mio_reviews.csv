Review
Found this place on Zomato and thought of giving it a try. Lovely Mexican food. It's a really small joint and might be missed while passing by it but once inside the food was excellent. The burrito bowl is an absolute to die for. Lovely vegetarian joint with some great fast service too
"Have had the opportunity of going to this place twice. And have had opposite reviews both the times.
Pizza - not good. Don't try.
Tacos - Too sour.
Nachos - decent
Garlic bread - above average.
Local beverages - taste like rasna.

1) Parking - 0/5. No valet available. No parking in the lane available.
2) size - 2/5. Only 3 tables to serve.
3) Ambience - 3/5. Needs work
4) service - 3/5. A bit slow for our liking.
5) taste buds - 3/5. Differ from dish to dish.
6) value for money - 3.5/5."
"¬°Hola a todos! Excellent restaurant in downtown Mumbai. It just proves my belief that small is beautiful. 2 table restaurant opposite Liberty cinema that serves muy deliciosa Mexican and Italian cuisine. And that is the USP!

Ordered a chipotle pizza and lasagna. Sufficient quantity, fresh taste and within good turnaround time. Amicable and pleasant manager. Estoy contento y voy a visitar de nuevo. ¬°Buena suerte por este restuarante!"
"TLDR; Good place to order from for those with cheese cravings and munchies.

While dining in is an option, the small size of the restaurant makes delivery a better option. This place dishes out Mexican as well as Italian fare. The Nachos are a must have an they rank very well according to me. The Quesidillas and the Jalepeno poppers are good too."
"MEXICAN OVER ITALIAN - had recently ordered food from here. The pasta and jalape√±o poppers were quite frankly, substandard. However the burrito bowl for us stole the show. The Mexican dish were well prepared and seasoned. Though not a chipotle like in USA but still good enough. Will definitely order the Mexican again from here."
"Being a frequent visitor to States and a fan of Mexican food, names like Chipotle is quite known to one. I have visited a lot of Mexican restaurants in Mumbai but that authentic taste was missing. Either the beans were too Indianized or their salsa was very sweet. I am writing a review after my 3rd consecutive visit to this place as I wanted to taste everything that they serve. All these doubts were cleared once I visited Aye Dios Mio near Bombay Hospital. It‚Äôs quite a small place, but the food makes up for everything. A very dainty cute little place, not much of a drama with the ambience, their concept of simplicity reflects in their simple yet authentic Mexican and Italian food....read more"
"Brilliant place for Mexican food. Had ordered spinach mushroom quesadilla and bbq paneer burrito, both were fresh and fantastic. Was eager to taste spinaci gnocchi pasta, but was not available. Hoping to taste it next time"
"Located at a place which is already crowded with so many eateries, this place still caught my eye! The main reason being its a PIZZA place!!

Things I tried:
Pizza Napoli
Italian nachos

Definitely a must go for all the Italian food lovers üçï"
Have been here once......the place is small but the food is quite good......the Mexican bean soup is yummmmyyyyy!!!!!!!!!! Have also ordered good home and it comes quite hot!!!
"We have ordered from this place a few times earlier through Swiggy, but last night went there for dine in.. Firstly, it's a very tiny place on the backside of Bombay hospital.. A bit difficult to find.. But as they say, big things come in small packages.. The hostess was really warm n welcoming..
It's an awesome place for Italian n Mexican food.. We first called for Black Eyed Bean Burrito.. It's absolutely fantastic.. It's served with a side of guacamole which is really tangy n delicious.. Next we called for Open Baked Crostini with mushroom n herbs.. Another delightful dish served with fries.. The bread was perfectly crispy and the mushroom preparation on top was really delicious.....read more"
"Very good food !! Must try Burrito Bowl n Enchiladas here.. The mocktails were tasty, but could tasted better if they were cold.

However, must try as a small gem in bylanes of Mumbai"
Though a small outlet .. Very good food. We tried Mexican cuisine. Good variety for Jains as well. must try restaurant Alaap Gosher Nilay Shah
We were invited recently to try these guys out. It took us a little searching to reach here but absolutely worth it. Its a really small place for dine in. First of the bat they offer a lot of Jain variety. Infact we tried the Classic Nachos the Jain way and were absolutely blown away. Freshly prepared nachos with dripping cheese provides a satisfaction which very few dishes do! And these guys absolutely nailed it. The salsa was also pitch perfect... neither too tangy nor too dry. And they were ready to give the beans separate which was a nice touch. Next being hardcore pizza-lovers it was pizza time. We ordered for the Barbeque Paneer Pizza. The Italian crust was wonderfully delivered and...read more
"Been here based on a Check-in.. Arrived here.. Something about the place struck the chord.. Writing the review even before the order has come in.. Courteous Staff.. Nice Music.. Nice Ambience..
Remaining post the Hogathon!!"
"One of my favourite places to go for a casual meal. It's priced reasonable with good quantity and has really delicious food. It also has a lot of jain variety.
Must try the farfalle paprika pasta (in a pink sauce served with two roasted breads) and the ultimo nachos(with beans, jalape√±o and cheese sauce). They also have good burritos(which may get a little spicy).
However, they're more of a delivery place than a dine in place which is why they have very few tables."
"A very good start up! Needs expansion.
For the super food they serve and a highly dedicated team! Larger space required and larger portion!!!"
"First impressions, we couldn't find the restaurant because it's located in this dim lit street of Barrack Road. But then, there's nothing not to like about the place. It's small, authentic and very the food is very exotic. Mexican and Italian. And we found the manager, lady, and the only, incredibly welcoming. And we've embarrassed her a little by asking if they had a nonveg lasagna, only then have we realized the place is a pure vegetarian and Jain ready. But, believe me, the food was incredible. We had Pomodoro with plum Italian tomato sauce and Penne something made with sundried tomatoes. Simply put, it's awesome. Best place for a vegan in the vicinity. Must go. Must try."
"So I ordered the Solo Mexicana for dinner from here and I must say I am tired of having bad food experiences from this place. I thought just the Italian food is bad but turns out the Mexican is worse. The fries are tooooo oily, the burrito bowl and tomato salsa taste terrible and the tortilla chips could have been crunchy at least! The place is literally right across my house and yet it took close to an hour to deliver and that too for such bad food. My friend decided to try the Margarita pizza and all she had was Masala papad! This south indian joint down the road does better pizzas."
Went to their 'restaurant' and waited for over 55 minutes to be served my burrito. In that much time they could have delivered it to my house. The chips and salsa were average at best. Not recommended.
Okay so I'm not a big fan of vegetarian food. But the vegetable lasagna I've eaten from here is without a doubt the best 've lasagna I've had in this city! I was so taken away by how flavourful it was and how chopped zucchini could wow me. Seriously. It's amazing. The sauce and the vegetables together really are amazing.
"This by far is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at, in Town..!
The owners have made a point to prioritize the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the overall service. Every dish we ate was perfect in taste as well as presentation. The owners, management staff and waitresses all made it a point to greet us and speak intelligently about the food. It's refreshing when the people who work there can actually speak to the quality of the food. Again, the food was excellent and I can't wait to eat there again!!

The food had many exceptional twists and flavors. You really savor each bite. The small plate option is great for sharing and its plenty of food...but you dont feel...read more"
"I have been to ADM a couple of years back. But my recent experience was superb. I ordered for a Classic Burrito Bowl and a Pizza Margherita with extra basil. The beans in the Burrito Bowl had a perfect smoky flavor which you don‚Äôt find in other restaurants. The beans you find in some places are dry but this had a perfect texture. The base of the pizza has gotten better. When I had it a year back, it was chewy and biscuity kind of texture. But this time, I was surprised to have a perfect thin crust base with an awesome pizza sauce.

Upon inquiring with the owner Mr, Akshay, mastermind behind the Mexican food at ADM, he said that he had bought about these changes from his own experience...read more"
"The staff was really cooperative and helpful. The place radiated a feeling of coziness and hospitality. The food was alright , a bit bland for my taste."
"Had this place on my to-visit places in Mumbai, last night went there with few friends.
After a bit struggle we found this tiny place on lanes near Bombay hospital.
I didn't expected the place to be small but that doesn't matter if you get good quality food.
We ordered Tomato Bruschetta, The Ultimate Mexwich, Paprika & Double cheese pizza.
All of the dishes were quite good, the pizza had perfect thin crust.
This place is great for quick food & budget friendly. 
There are no negative points except the small space, but its cool to hang with friends & have quality food.
Recommended if you love Mexican food as there are few ones around."
"Hello , A really must visit place i tried pasta in red sauce which was amazing and tried burritos which really were too good and lastly ya the pizza which actually reminded me of spain becoz i am from spain and was waiting to eat here the best thing of pizza was a very thin crust,The best mexican food i must have ever had cheers to the team of Oh my god üòç"
"Aye dios mio is a must visit for all you Mexican lovers! And the star behind this, Chef Puja Khaturia, is simply amazing !
An absolutely value for money and really huge burritos that'll fill you up to your hearts content but will leave you wanting more!
Love the fact that they are pretty bang on with their flavors and the Mexican food isn't indianized for once. Pretty authentic.
The glaucomole is really taste and perfectly made and the salsa has just the right amount of sourness to it. It's really juicy and yummy!
My personal favorite there though has got to be the gnocchi piccolo ! The gnocchi is made to perfection .
Thank you Puja for always leaving me so satisfied with your...read more"
"Aye Dios Mio has been on my wish list for a really long time and finally I had the chance to try it out a couple of weeks back. 

It is an extremely tiny place and can sit only about 4-6 people at any given point of time. The service and food make up for the infrastructure.

The food, reasonably priced, is pretty filling and delicious. A great place to order from!"
"As it's rightly said never judge the book by its cover never judge a restaurant by its first look.. This tiny small place in by lanes of marine lines can be easily missed but once you eat there you will never miss it again..

Been three years this place is open serving Italian and Mexican food.. having only 2 tables of 4 ppl each this place is a hit for home deliveries. Our first impression was woorysome and we were skeptical how the food would be..

We ordered their asado jain burrito and guys the first bite made our inhibitions disappear... It was sooo delicious.. One of the best burrito ever had by us.. The flavour the taste rice all perfect.. then we had their Panini sandwich and it...read more"
"I ordered the picante buritto, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor..those mexican fries though...yummmmyyy..so crispy and flavorful"
"AYE DIOS MIO well known for its Mexican and Italian food! which I love the most! Pasta is just awesome!! Not many restaurants have been serving such great Mexican food!!! this place is been my favorait for very long! went there Saturday night in the night! and we loved the food! Had lazania, half jain and half nonjain pizza which was awesome than we called for garlic tatertots.. Great great good and most important service is also damn Good! That beautiful girl handles everything very nicely. very sweetly! everything was perfect the way they take care of their customers will definitely wants go back!"
"They are my workplace neighbors hence I have tried their food a couple of times along with my friends. 

And I must say I like their food quite a bit.

We ordered Rosso Rice and Picante Burrito. We liked them both! :)

Quite authentic in their taste and also yummy! :P"
"Cute little place in the by lane opposite the Bombay Hospital. Their target audience is mostly corporate party orders and home deliveries so their outlet is quiet small (max 8 people can sit). Also, they serve only veg (which is a challenge, considering the delicacies of Mexican and Italian cuisine).
I had one of their 10' inch pizzas (with tomatoes and sweet corn, can't recall the name) and it was delightful! The crust was thin and the mozzarella was gooey enough for my liking. The service was a little slow, but their sweet manager who was more than helpful made up for it."
"Aye dios mio is small delivery outlet in the bylane near bombay hospital. Its has a good home delivery patronage which can be easily ascertained looking at the small size of the outlet. The place currently cannot accomodate more than 10-12 people. Its a initiaive started by 3 friends who intend to introduce authentic mexican and italian veg cusine and its good to see thier active involvement in running the resto. Tried the devils delight pizza, farfalle paprika, bean and cheese quasedilla, black eyes bean burrito, picante burrito,peach and orange cooler, and sinful chocolate cake. All the dishes were excellent and had a real authentic mexican and italian feel to it . The sinful chocolate...read more"

Went yesterday on my B'day!! I always order food from this place! I have good delivery experience! well dining is also awesome! went with my bestfrind! and she loved it! you must try thr Burrito! no doubt with other food but I think this time pizza base was lil hard! But I never had Graden veges pizza like this! And most imoportant thing I don't no the meaning of this restaurant and finally It meant OH MY GOD IN SPANISH!! I can call it ADM if u can't pronounce the name! explained by poojaüë© Very cute and frindly staff! people who makes the place beautifulüíó Thank u ADM and pooja for making my B'day very special üëç
A more delivery business but can accommodate 2 groups of 4 each max. Hygiene and quality of food is good. SoBo is not where I live and hence only option I had was to go down and visit the outlet. Try to expand to our Suburbs too.
"Sooooooo Good.. food awesome! went thr around 10.45pm. they were just about to close. but I really appreciate that sweet girl who allow me to come inside... I was totally confused with thr menu. so finally I asked the sweet lady and she told me to have pizza toe toe10"" and It was awesoooomm.. she handles everything very beautifully. I really love to go back again n again. this place is very nice as I read about this place in reviews.. and specially STAFF.. Will defiantly visit agin"
"On a Saturday afternoon, we thought of going out for a lunch. But the terrible heat outside dissuaded us from leaving the office and going anywhere. So we thought of ordering from Aye Dios Mio, as had heard a lot about their food. Fortunately, they take online order on Zomato, so we ordered through Zomato.

So we ordered Classic Panini Sandwich, Pimento Rice and Penne Arrabiata between the 3 of us. 

The Panini Sandwich was very nice with proper fillings. Penne Arrabiata was a little on a sweet-ish side, but eatable though. Pimento Rice was the best. Nice and cheesy. A real delicacy. The quantity was a little less, according to me.

Would like to try other things on their menu, and that...read more"
"Ordered from here because of the good rating, but like most other lower budget places, they're severely misleading. We had the Italian and Mexican assorted plates and it was HORRIBLE. If people think this pasta is good, I pity your lives for never having eaten decent pasta. The sauce was watery and disgusting and pasta itself bland and cardboard-ey. Nachos were terrible. Condiments have all been chucked in the bottom of our garbage bin because I thought I'd be sick. And, worst of all, THEY MADE FRIES TASTE BAD. Potato fries. In spices AND in cheese. That is lifetime achievement unlocked for me. Literally not a single morsel tasted decent. Had quite an adventure though."
100% value for money . Ambience 3/5. Food 4/5 . Great Mexican and Italian food. Aye dios mio is the place for quick bites . I would love to come back and have a bite
"Had quite a head-splitting-ache, wanted some good comfort food. So placed order through Zomato.

1 x Veg Lasagna Pasta
1 x Chocolate Cake

The good part.

- They accepted the order, the previous order (in another restaurant) I had placed through Zomato was declined!
- The delivery was quick - though the estimated time was an hour. Yay!
- The Lasagna Pasta was fulfilling

The bad part.

-There were no spoons or forks provided.
-There was minimal Pasta in the main dish
-The main dish wasn't too tasty
-The Chocolate Cake is not a cake, rather it's just solidified Chocolate

"Small place tucked in a street close to dominos pizza....has a seating of only 2 tables....but the place has a nice ambiance...the proprietor is a sweet young lady who is more than helpful about choosing a dish or even telling you places to see around.
Came here on a weekday night at almist 1015 pm for a quick bite....after a walk along marine drive with friends.
Ordered burrito bowl, classic nachos and chipotle paneer pizza.
Classic nachos were nice..but had a little excess of myonnaise...tasty nevertheless....

"The first impression at the store was waiting , to be honest the place is too small - only 2 tables. so we were like is this where we are going to have our dinner. But the perception changed after the food came . Superb Mexican - Guys you are too good. Food comes fresh and a small place means the kitchen is just next to the table that aroma makes u craving for more. In the background a mix of soft rock and pop playing. This place is for the food lovers who wont even hesitate to visit a street stall."
"There chef salad is superb. Pizza are quite Indian style and avoidable. Being a non-vegetarian, I generally order only the salad. Rest of the stuff is average"
"Been on a food regime but since it's a Sunday thought let's order from some new place in SoBo.

After nearly a month ordered or actually had a pizza, so ordered a BBQ Paneer pizza 10"" and a Enchilada.

Anxiously waiting for food and it gets delivered in about 40min considering Sunday I would say prompt.

Pizza very average and BBQ Paneer I believe should have some BBQ sauce marinated or barbecued but ideally could not even taste anything on them, when u start delivering to places you should first and foremost get good packaging which makes sure the food is atleast kept warm when delivered, the corrugated box for pizza is the problem as pizza came cold and the pizza must have been...read more"

"Had an exam at West End Hotel so i had spent an afternoon researching where should i have my lunch. So basically, Zomato was my only reference for this place and hell, i wasn't disappointed at all!!! The place is nothing on the ambience front as they majorly work on delivery system. I ordered a Toe Toe pizza and House salad.. The pizza was a cheese overload, which is always welcome, but that didn't mean the other veggies had no chance to work their magic! The taste and crispness of the pizza was very well balanced. The house salad was above average, though i feel they should really go easy on the amount of vinegar used. All in all, the pizza won my heart and would surely visit the place...read more"
"ADM is one of the best places in south mumbai to have mexican food.You should especially try the black eyed bean burrito,the tex-mex sandwich and the chilly garlic pizza."
"Had heard a lot about this place and after tasting their food I would like to agree. Their Jain food is beyond amazing and the quantity they serve is far more than what you expect. Reasonably priced good Jain food at your doorstep in half an hour, just what you need on a Sunday! Special thanks to the staff ;)"

Just a brisk walk away from both Churchgate and Marine Lines stations, this green dot place serves delicious vegetarian Italian and Mexican cuisine preparations. The size of this small place will shock you, but as they say, if the heart is big enough..

You can surely try this different place."
Have called the food home and i cant resist but to review the food while i eat... The order came a bit late but doesn't matter... The thin crust margherita pizza with chillies and sun dried tomatoes is simply fabulous...nice and spicy.. The penne arrabiata is a delight for people who love spicy pasta... Deserves 5/5

Very small place...
Only two tables....
Beverages are not at all good..

This place is near to my college. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Place is small but the food is good. Lasagne is a must try. Even their pizza and burritos are good. But rice combo was a bit disappointment for us.
"A small little place which serves great food. I have had the best nachos ever, the other dishes that we ordered were delicious too, good enough to satisfy me to the core. Very well priced, this place should be on your radar if you are around marine lines and want to have a foodgasm."
"Aye dios mio a small little place is enough to satisfy your stomach. It has a capacity of 8 people i.e. 2 tables only. The ambience will never make you feel great. But once order placed. The quality and the quantity of the food just brings a smile on your face. A must try place. This is a place where the chef cooks from bottom of his heart and the taste is enough to know that.
Rated 3.0 for its quality of food.‚ù§"

The Classic Nachos was really good. The chips were really thin and crispy. But a suggestion to reduce the quantity of cream and add more cheese. Nachos is famous because it contains loads of cheese.
The BBQ Paneer pizza was a delight...a nice thin crust pizza.

"On the basis of some great Zomato review, we visited this restaurant for an impromptu dinner. While we were expecting a small eatery, we realised that it is more of a delivery outlet than a proper sit down restaurant. 

We started our meal with vege quesadilla which was quite good. This was followed by arroz rojo (good but a little too spicy) and classic burrito (nice). The service was prompt but this rating speaks mostly about the food."
"This is for the dine in experience and the home delivery.. .
This is a small place so you know ordering is a very considerable option. Now the food. ....
Garden fresh veggies pizza was really delicious . The burritos are pretty good too. Definitely try the Mexican french fries really different and you will love the taste. Pasta.... good too. Their nachos are surprising. .. for a joint of that scale the food definitely is at a whole other level .
Home delivery experience. ... amazing .. on time and the food comes in a very respectably packed condition. Although a little bit expensive I thought."
"Food joint where u can order amazing Mexican and Italian cuisines.
I visited this place with my sister on saturday evening.
We ordered Chipotle Paneer pizza and spinach corn cheese quesidella.
Quesidella was average one with a very little cheese filling.
But it was the pizza which took our heart. It was thin crust, tangy, crispy and the 10'' size was big enough. I took half pizza as parcel and it taste so good even after 4 hours.

Definitely visiting this place again when i am in South Mumbai."

When it wasn't delivered by 8:45 pm, I called up the restaurant to check the status, upon which, the concerned person responded that since it's a Sunday and a rush hour, it takes time to manage all the orders, and said that it would reach my place in 10-15 more minutes...read more"

All three of us came down with a throat infection the very same night. (That was the only common food we had)
For one of us it was so severe that she had difficulty swallowing anything the day after and had to consult an ENT.
All in all, an awful experience.
Definitely avoidable!!!"

"Just two words.... Must try!!
The pizzas are yummmm.... Chipotle paneer is just toooo good
Very rare do we find a place which is pure veg... The place is small... But we always have an option of take away :)
They are not too choosy about the delivery areas... Being located at marine lines... They do deliver till Colaba... Absolute thumbs up for that!!"
