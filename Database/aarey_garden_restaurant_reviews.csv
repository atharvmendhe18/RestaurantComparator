Perfect place to spend your day amidst nature. They serve lip smacking food with refreshing mocktails too. Both outdoor and indoor seating is available. The price is reasonable too. Definitely worth a try!!!

Really happy with the service as well and also the quantity makes it worth every penny."
The food quality was really nice. The quantity of food was exceptional. The nonveg food was really well cooked even the veg food was really amazing.
The food quality was exceptional. The quantity of the food was also really good. The prawns and chicken were very well cooked. Malai chicken is a must try. The quantity of the Biryani was also amazing.
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Ordered food for team lunch at our office in Andheri West. Our expectations were not that high going by the EARLIER REVIEWS, but the reality is COMPLETELY OPPOSITE. It’s mouth watering, delicious, it’s 11 on 10.

Food Quality 10/10
Flavours 11/10

Staff should be well manner . Poor quality service.We had to wait more than hour for food and the restaurant was practically empty at that Time . The food was not good .Never recommending this to anybody.

"A Vegetarian restaurant and bar in the bylanes of Ghatkopar. It's a reasonable place. There is a lot of snacks that is served on the house with your drinks. The staff is really responsive. It's a comfortable environment for a lengthy sitting. Very good starters. Food is really well made. There is valet parking, so no bother."
"A perfect place to get away from the busy city and enjoy your food in the presence of nature. They have a family restaurant and an outdoor seating arrangement as well. The food here is also fresh and good. You can carry your own booze to the restaurant! In conclusion, give it a shot!"

"Very good place to chill and sit peaceful and the advantage of this place is you can take your own booze and sit there!

"I have been going to this place from a long long time probably 10-12 years...
This place use to be a great open to sky restaurant..
But I have seen a drastic drop down in food quality and poor service from the hotel...
Few years back we use to say let's go to aarey restaurant but now if someone says let's go there then I have to think twice before saying yes...
Last night I was there with my friends to have dinner and the kind of service we got was really pathetic...
Food was not even 3/10
My friends had ordered chicken triple shezwan fried rice and surprisingly there was no chicken in the rice the only chicken present in the dish was in the gravy...
And to top it up the staff tried to...read more"
"Would not recommend this place just because of the staff's behavior. They are rude, arrogant and not professional at all. Visited this restaurant with my parents but the manager was so arrogant that had to leave with in an hour. Being in a service industry they have no sense how to behave with guest. Management should really do something regarding this.

A big no for this place ....please take your family and friends some place nice rather than here."
"Good location, Average quality of food and absolute worst class of service sprkinled with a dash of non courteous staff. Complete disregard towards customers with no interest shown to customer requirements.

If you want to treat ""Attention Seeking Disorder"" of your friend, bring them here. The staff will make sure that they will ignore them in all ways possible."
"Had visited this place with my friends for a traditional Indian styled chicken also known as gauti chicken, this place has an open air seating as well as an ac seating. This place doesn't mostly see a lot of family crowd, mostly people who want to have some food with some booze. So if you're in a company of people wanting to have some booze and some chicken then this is the place to be.
Wouldn't recommend taking the open air as that place looks a little shady, would prefer taking the Ac seating instead.
The food is decent the traditional chicken for which k had visited this place wasn't that great, the chicken felt like it was malnourished and didn't have any flesh on it. Wouldn't...read more"
"Have been a regular visitor here and much has been said about this restaurant already and I am only going to re-iterate some of the points:-

Ambience: No other establishment in the city can beat the ambience here. It only goes to show how much joy nature can give us when we are with our loved ones and why we should keep our beloved city green.

*HOWEVER - They have started to screen IPL matches on projector and relay the commentary on loudspeakers. In my opinion with a USP of being right in between the city's only wilderness why should they aspire to be a loud sports bar? People would (and should) appreciate the total electronic disconnect (at least I do)
The above was the only reason...read more"
"I'm a regular goer here. And I always prefer the open area. Since this place is located in the midst of Aarey milk area, the climate is always so cool and pleasant. Specially during winters it's just perfect. Try sitting in the open area and eat some roti, naans and some scrumptious desi khaana. Well if you're a Chinese lover, call your self lucky because they also serve great Chinese food. You can buy your own alcohol and take it in. They will charge you a little bit for taking your bottle of alcohol in. It's not too much though. An ideal place to sit with your homies and create a new adda for your meets. Trust me, you won't go home disappointed. Also the service is very quick and...read more"
"It's a good place with good food. Away from the city crowd, perfect place to enjoy with your friends or family.

They have both indoor and outdoor seatings..
Everyone prefers to sit outside to enjoy the amazing climate as it is located in the Aarey forest

They don't server alcohol here but you can bring it from outside and pay some charges and you can enjoy your drink ..

1. Channa Koliwada
Boiled Channa dip Fried with garlic flavour. 😋

"Went to AAREY GARDEN RESTAURANT on a weekday for dinner.

FOOOOD FIRSTTT!!!!!

We had
1. CHINESE MOONG SALAD- Talking about the quantity first, it was great for 4 people. The slightly crisp moong sprouts with a Chinese based mix was something I never imagined to taste this good. A bit on spicier side, a great dish to start with.

2. CHICKEN MANCHOW SOUP- served at the right temperature and with crisp fried noodles. It had adequate seasoning of garlic and chillies and minced chicken. Again, good.

3. PANEER CHUTNIWALA- I now realize that the quantity served here is quite good. This had 8 good pieces of chunky fresh paneer with tomato and capsicum pieces to add to the quantity. Served with...read more"
"I have visited this restaurant in aarey colony multiple times for corporate dinners. Surrounded by nature, this place serves great tandoori and seafood specialties. Although, the best way to enjoy this restaurant is to visit with family or a large group of people. The fountains are lovely and lit up most evenings."
"Been to this place twice for Lunch long ago in 2016... Though reaching this place is not easy with all the traffic and turns in Aarey.... the Food and the ambience is worth the trouble....

All the non-veg dishes are yummy... but even if you are a non-vegetarian try ""Smoky Moong""..... it's yummy !!"
I was here for a buffet organise by a family friend of mine. The food was well above okay. The staff was really really courteous. The ambience of this place is really very very nice and peaceful. Food - 3.5 /5 Staff - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4.5/5
"The place is located in the outskirts of Goregaon it is difficult to find the place but as u reach there u will find greenery and many such flower over there the taste of the food was amazing . Enjoying good food in a good atmosphere and greenery is a place in heaven for the mumbaiker
Staff :3.5/5 hygiene: 4/5 taste 4/5 quality 3.5/5 quantity: 4/5 value for money:4/5"
"A good place for family with greenery view
Good food+good greenery =unforgettable place
About food I liked starters like potato cheese croquet, peshwari tikki, Banjara Kabab. In main course I like surmai curry with bombil fry and in veg paneer tikka in malavani style I loved . The food was so nice i forgot to take pic of photos😜.
Restaurant rating - 8/10
Food rating - 4/5"
"Axis bank card 20% discount offer was mentioned in Zomato website, while it was clearly refused by the restaurant saying that we had discontinued this with Zomato long back and its there mistake that they have not updated the same. Staff was not at all friendly nor the management of the restaurant. Will not recommend this to anyone.

Totally a waste."
It’s a wonderful place in rainy season but the staff is very slow and the food quality is also not that good .pricing is too high non veg starter not less then 400 rs but after paying so much u dnt get what u want
The service is good . Food is average . Great place to get your own booze and drink in peace. Perfect gateway during monsoons to move away from the city rush in the heart of Mumbai green cover .
We have been over here last Friday and we are regular customer of ur joint but this time the food quality was more then worse chicken were frozen and not at all fresh and when we told manager to replace that they did but they said we won’t take any of ur orders and that’s really bad to say the customer we were said that we would pay u but the quality is not at all good they need to change the manager as he was very much rude
"Great place with good ambience. Not so easy to reach but its worth trying. Ordered chicken sandwich which took almost 30 mins to serve but it was worth waiting.
The place is really cool and its surrounded by nature which makes the mind really calm.
Staffs are friendly and love the hospitality.
Must visit"
"A very simple place, they have a huge dining open air dining area and a relatively smaller AC section. Went on a Sunday afternoon and surprisingly the restaurant was completely empty. The food is strictly above average, nothing great but nothing from what we ordered was bad as such. The quantity is pretty decent too. Service is quick, you can carry your own booze to this place, they charge a very nominal corkage fee of 200rs per bottle / 100rs for half and 50 for quarter.

What we ordered:

- Chicken pahadi 3/5
- Veg crispy 3/5
- Paneer oriental roll 3/5
- Butter chicken 3.5/5
- Paneer tikka masala 3/5

Main course was best talking of quality and quantity both!

"This place is right in the middle of Aarey, getting to this place and traveling back is an issue if Uber/Ola not available. Overall a very good ambiance, they have a huge property and you have lots of different types of seating area available. The drop in temperature and the silence makes the atmosphere of the place perfect to sit with your friends and chat. The best part of this restaurant is you can carry your own liquor bottle and enjoy their services by paying a minimal corkage. So if you have a good bottle and want to enjoy it with your friends then this place is perfect and the atmosphere of this place is an added advantage.

A very chilled out place out in the woods of AAREY COLONY. Situated right in the middle of Aarey this restaurant is always chilled and has great food with customer friendly staff. One of the best things of this restaurant is that you can also carry your own alcohol and pay a minimal charge per bottle that you carry.
"Horrible experience. Manchow soup was loaded with salt and chilly and we had to ask them to redo it. When asked about the number of papads in roasted masala papad, the server said 2. while ordering the paneer tikka, we requested for no synthetic food colour but it was brought with synthetic food colour so we returned it. Ultimately we decided to not break our head further and requested them to get the bill. They had no regret and were happy to let us go"
This place is located in the greenery of array colony. They donot serve alcohol but let you carry your own. The food is average but the ambience and service makes up for it. The mutton starter ordered was so soft and delicious it made our nite. Surprising location within Mumbai.... Must try.
"Build in the interior part of Arrey colony, it is quiet a gateway from city traffic. Good place to be over the weekend, they allow u to carry your own liquor. The food here is nice specially the sea food, service is good as well. They also have a designated family section, so taking along your family will not be an issue. The garden setup makes it a very good choice."
Mutton boti kebab was extremely chewy. Left half plate untouched. Service also not very prompt. Ambience is old school and I liked it. Good place to have liquor Desi style!
Very bad experience. The management is very uncoorporative. They were not at all friendly. I do not recommend any one to visit this place. Worst place ever
"A beautiful Location !! Want to enjoy food in the woods , definately visit this resturant !! A silent place .. no traffic sounds n well maintained environment ... The food Quality is even better n no match to the taste ... there are individual sections for family n party (friends) ... gives a great chance to taste a variety of cusines in a sweet environment ... Even the staff is wonderful n good Ambience ... A huge parking space so that you can njoy your food without thinking about you carr !!! Must visit !!!"
I am trying to call on both landline numbers. But no one is receiving the call. Is the restaurant operating? If there is any alternate number. Plz share it.
"Nice place. As it's after rains can enjoy the beauty of nature. Good good, nice ambience, winters would be more better time to enjoy dinner in the open garden."
"At first, we didn't believe there could be a resto amidst the jungle. But then, once we reached there we were like 'whoaa.' The place has an indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangement. It's a beautiful space nestled with greenery that actually serves the best starters menu. Do try their cheese-garlic naan and chicken tandoori. And guess what? They also have live ghazal performances too! If you are looking forward to relax yourself, head to this place straight with your gang for good food and booze."
Worst experience ... There menu card is all different and they charge different ... I ordered chiken biryani and cold drink they charged me 500 rs for that really upset with this thing .. they charged 100 rs for one half ltr cold drink ... I wish I could have known before placing order ..
"Located in aarey colony . If u r visiting for the first time it would be difficult to find out . Makes u feel, u having dinner in proper garden surrounded by nature.
There are less varieties in terms of food & drinks
Ambience is divided into 3 parts open garden , ac & non ac

Food- 3/5
Service -3/5
Ambience-3/5

Only thing great about this restro is they allow u bring your own booze at minimal cost"

WE CHOOSE SKYOPEN...
SERVICE IS SLOW....
AC SECTION WAS REALLY GOOD TO SIT...
Quantity is enough"
"A nice outdoor garden restaurant, away from the bustling haywire of the city. It is located inside Aarey , no on the main road. They allow you to bring your own booze at very nominal charge.. which is very cool.
The crowd and food is good, we tried both veg n non veg both were ok. nothing to comment about. Chana Koliwada was good, the waiter bought moong sautéed in Chinese sauces which was actually very good.
Chicken masala was totally ok and cold.
If u love garden restaurants, try this place. Ull like it. Others avoid."
"The ambience doesn't get any better. Right in the heart of Aarey Milk Colony, in lush green surroundings. Beautiful setting- although a little extra direction signages would've helped.
Food is fantastic. I tried the safer bet of Indian non veg food instead of Chinese. They give you an option of desi murgi as well and the food was simply fresh and yummy. Definitely a hidden gem worth exploring."
Superb location..with good service...staff is helpful..bit overpriced but..overall good !!!...Get your own Booz.here.. they charge some amount in bill
"Nice location.. within Arrey.. away from the city and the traffic, on a small hill top.. surrounded by nature.
The food is good too.. especially Indian. Chinese is strictly okAy.
They also allow to get your own booze for a minimal cost.. so it's ideal for group booze parties."
"Dining in the Woods
Wine & Dine in a Jungle

For a Special evening an excellent place surrounded by greenary. Play area for Kids.
Food is awwesome specially the live kitchen select ur favorite fish and the sprouts tossed in blackbean Sauce.
Live Orchestra was very peaceful...
I dedicated a song fr my hubby as it was his bday
""Tum Mile Dil Khile"" which was quite romantic and later they sanged a bday jingle fr him.
The fourth star for the amazing location."
"Nice open area seating with family zones, smoking and non smoking area. The place is inside Aarey colony. The food is good with Indian chicken and wide variety of fresh fish to choose from. the service is quick and efficient."
"Restaurant is good. They allow you to bring your own booze. For that they charge you certain amount according to the volume. Food quality is also nice, But prices are bit high. They play gazhal their which is irritate after some time. Except that over all time was good. Like that place for food, service and all arrangement."
"I love this restaurant only becuase of two things :
1) They allow you to bring your own booze 8
2) The location is awesome, i will call it ""Ek Hotel Jungle K Ander"" :p"
"5 on 5 for the location. Everyone should try this restaurant for its location. It's hidden, green, no noise, serene. Love this.
Food is pretty okayish. Nothing great in taste too. Service is good.
Must try for all Mumbaikars.
Cheers."
Situated amidst the greenery of Aarey...it's perfect getaway for some quality time...open garden seating enhances the ambience...the service is ok...food is good....you can also bring in your own liquor from outside...
"I'd been hearing about this place for a long time for at least 5-6 yrs but had never got an oppty to go there. It's in between the Aarey colony on a hill surrounded by greenery. They have an AC section n outside open section. If goin all the way to this place why sit in the AC. Even outside they have a family n a bachelors section. This is more of bachelors drinking place. They don't sere liquor but the best part is you can get your own booze.

"The setup of Aarey Garden is like a Dhaba in middle of the jungle of Aarey colony. Locating this place at night can be a challenge and come here in your own vehicle bcz you won't get an auto at night from here. Has both a/c and non-a/c sections though nothing much to talk about the ambience.

Now comes the best part!! You can get your own alcohol:) so drink as much as you can. The food here is good especially non-veg. There's live ghazal performances at night that let you enjoy your drink. I prefer to go there in winters and take a table in the open air section."
HIGHLY OVERPRICED.The food is not worth the prices.Even the quantity is not good.The only thing about this place is its location.Service is good.
"As I have been living in aarey for almost 5 years now, I thought its about time I try this place. I ordered in. o start I decided to keep it simple and ordered Chicken fried rice and chilly chicken. This is no fine dining restaurant and hence I felt the food was overpriced. When it came the quality there was further disappointment.  While the chilly chicken was fine, the rice was below average. 
The other thing about this place is that they allow you to carry your own booz, which is something uncommon in Mumbai.

"Want to drink like a tank with amazing food to support your system , this is the place.

Note: do not attempt drinking even a drop of alcohol if you plan to drive out from here... The security check is really bad"
You may like the ambience if you are going there with your own booze ! I wouldn't recommend this place for vegetarians as the dishes hardly had any taste ! However they have a variety of dishes in their non-veg menu! Skip this place if you are with your family.
"A lovely place located in the only greeny place of Mumbai ( The Arrey Colony ). The place is some what like the dhaba filing with hot & mouth watering food deliciously prepared. Place good place who loves to drink , here you can carry in your own bottle of your choice order for ice bucket with some nominal charge along with the great food. This make your evening great with no comprise on drink selection with the awesome food in nice pleasant atmosphere of greenery with jungle effect of bird making noise. No high class decor or ambience , just a perfect dhaba feeling in middle of the busy running city."
"Aarey Garden Restaurant.
Never knew a place like this exists in Aarey!!!

To start with...It’s little difficult to find the place.  We came to know about this place through a friend and so we decided to try it out of course with little hesitation since its zomato page does not give you much info and proper idea of this place. But once we reached the place we were amazed… as we enter we heard classic ghazal and were wondering whose playing and the waiter said they often have  ghazal mehfils ain’t that amazing?

Located in the exteriors of the city..Lovely and very quiet place..nice place to chill n relax with kith and kin..Food is pretty decent..menu includes majorly Maharashtrian cuisine.. :)
"Been here 2 times. The only plus is the location. BYOB is the concept. Food is nothing to brag about. Not to mention the ego-boosted waiting staff, who have a huge conception that they are doing a great job.
Good place for big groups without a desire for good food."
"Its a lovely n romantic place, big space and well organised sitting area, quite inside the jungle makes this plc beautiful. Staff ppl are generous, must visit"
"Highly recommended place for guys who are looking out for a evening with drinks in a garden restaurant. Place is quite big and its an open air restaurant and the ambience is simply superb a chilly evening. You have to carry your own drinks here as they don't keep drinks. Food is really good especially the starters we had chicken platter, mandeli fry, avoid chinese dish such as chicken crispy. Dal khicdi is also good. Prices are ok as you cannot get the open air experience which you will get here. We really had a good time here, will definitely visit again. Difficult to get an auto so we booked an uber ride."
"Best garden restaurant in mumbai....awesome place to have dinner in open place with fresh air..
Ambience is good. Food was also tasty
But u need your private vehicle to reach here since it is located deep in aarey area.
U have to get your own alcohol....
Overall a good place to spend time"
Loved it..triple schezwan rice is a must try..the taste may vary since i heard d quality of food detiorates as it gets crowded..but I'll love going der again..doesn't feel like Mumbai..
"Quite a good place and a bit more organized den I expected.

Quite impressed with the ambiance. Open lawn different cubic arranged greenery everywhere beautiful lightning and a singer to give all those alcoholic a kick with his old songs. He does sing well when it comes to songs from jagjit Singh but pls avoid singing new songs in the same tone.

Appreciate the courteous behavior we received from ur staff.

Being an office gathering and though we were in our mode of pre post business review we enjoyed food and music.


I luved the starters.

"If you don't have a place to finish your booze Aarey Garden Restaurant works perfectly well for you. It more than welcomes you with your own hard drinks.
Its a little difficult to find at first, but one visit is enough for you to know the way. Its in the midst of a jungle of sorts (Aarey colony), so when they say its a garden restaurant they mean serious business. Food is good enough if you are concentrating more on what you're carrying but not so much for those who are there specifically to satiate hunger.
The restaurant takes orders till 11 and is open till beyond that time. Awesome for groups and get together. Cheers ;)
P.S - Its a little notorious as far as billing is concerned....read more"
"An open restaurant with no bar is a little downer but the surroundings are good and natural.
Don't venture too late at night, goes via leopard prone area.
Onion soup is recommended."
"A nice place. Atmosphere is great because it is situated in Aarey Colony. Food is average in terms of taste. Rate card is bit on high side. Overall, a one time go place."
"Visited this place yesterday with my friends.The location was breathtaking,the staff were courteous and the most important thing i.e food was delicious! Being a veggie, i would recommend paneer tikka and moong dun tikki. My nonveg friends loved the chicken.I would highly recommend you all to go to this place and absorb the atmosphere! :)"
Went there on a rainy day to have some tea and cheese pakoda. We mainly chose the place due to the open area and lush green feel however to our disappointment they served the tea and pakoda after almost half an hour when we lost our patience and mentioned to leave. Food and tea were not so great. Corn pakoda was more like cutlet filled with potatoes and bits of corn. Taste was very average filled with black pepper. To my surprise those supposed corn cutlets costed us a whopping 210 rs and along with the tea was 289 rs. Lol ! Definitely not worth the money i would say.
