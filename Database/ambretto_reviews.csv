Review
Always ordered from Mahim. They have really good sandwiches .. Why did you stop the baguettes and poutines? New menu has very less options :(
"Tiny place but packs a big bang. Run by friendly owners one of whom is always around greeting the guests and happy to discuss gastronomy and tastes to blend them into your order too. That's what keeps the place innovating.

Simply love their poutines both options of fries and wedges. They have recently revised their menu to o include wraps, pastas and also set menus. Must visit and definitely one of those hidden gems in the city."
"Don't go by the reviews! Totally deceptive & disappointing...! Giving it a 1 star cz i don't have option to give 0.5 or 0!
1stly came thinking it'll be a restaurant but he does delivery only! Still ordered grilled chicken poutine & sparrow baguette... Rates charged vary from given in the menu uploaded... hardly found any chicken in the poutine n as far as baguette was concerned it was just bread with some barbeque sauce... Regret paying every single penny here!
Keep hopes n try at ur own risk!"
"Ambretto is a no frills joint that focusses very well on its food.
The first time i had visited this place i got to try their jalapeno cream n paneer empanada and cottage cheese poutine.
The jalapeno cream n paneer filling was bang on while i realised that the empanada bread (which is baked) was not my thing.
The poutine was devoid of cheese curds but still made up with its crisp fries and yummy sauces.
Thanks to the courteous owner i received two complimentary iced teas which was equally well made and one of the best i have had.
On my recent visit i realised that empanadas have been discontinued which i really regretted as i was looking forward to try that again.
Instead landed up with...read more"
"Ordered the Capt. Jack Sparrow baguette sub and it was delicious. Lovely caramelized onions with copious amounts of cheese and juicy chunks of chicken and the baguette was quite soft and nice. And it cost 200 bucks. Value for Money, i should say.

Would love to try out their other stuff soon, especially the Poutine. Ordering again from them for sure. :)"
"This place caught my eye while browsing around for a good sandwich place other than Subway. So, when the opportunity presented itself I gave this place a visit for some snacks in the evening. 

I was underwhelmed by the appearance of the place. It is very shabby and very small and hardly maintained. It is mostly a delivery joint so that figures. It is a self service joint so not much to say about the service. 

Coming to the food, its average. The name of the dishes seem more intersting than the dishes themselves which is disappointing. We had That 70s salad, which had shredded chicken on top which was not juicy, but rather dry. The dressing however was good. The wedges were overpriced...read more"
"This is the kind of place that you go to after college with your buddies and eat greasy affordable, pocket money friendly food.
Now, if only i knew this before i went there, my expectations would be more realistic.

I went here mainly to try their burgers (which look good in photographs) but also because their menu looks quite ambitious (Po boy sandwich, meatball marinara sub and poutines)

The poutine however wasnt a poutine and the burger wasn't a burger!
The bacon burger was a bun stuffed with bacon, lettuce and tomato! Just call it a B.L.T! It had no patty, how is it a burger?!

The poutine was, well, french fries, poorly melted clotted mozzarella, packet chicken sausages...read more"
"Ambretto is equivalent to comfort food. They serve empanadas, poutines, subs and the like.

I have ordered their food home multiple times but never actually visited so cant comment on their ambience or service section. The home delivery is pretty decent though.

Their version of poutines contain all the things that make a soul happy : fries, chicken, cheese. All held together by amalgamation of sauces, giving tangy to sweet taste. I like the grilled chicken one best.

Other dishes fare well too. Juicy Lucy, though not as Dunkins, does hold up on its own and so does Ct Jack Sparrow. They are interestingly named, over favourite characters and movies. Sheldon is my top favourite so picked...read more"
"Ambretto is such a small place that despite walking by it every other day for a year, I've just noticed it. Ambretto finds itself in the Collection of 'Hidden Gems', but it's not something that always lives upto its promise. The quality is inconsistent, and as a restaurant it has many flaws. But on the positive side, it has really unique stuff which has great potential.

Service: It really depends on who happens to take your order. In its type of service, it's most similar to Subway. There was no blunder on their part. However it's disappointing to see that some of the dishes on offer were unavailable.

Ambience & D√©cor: Pathetic and abysmal. It's just two small and unhygienic tables, in...read more"
"Visited Ambretto for dinner last night. 
It's a small no frills place in Mahim whose menu and food I couldn't hep but compare to Between breads in Bandra except Ambretto's pricing is much more reasonable.
We tried out just a few things and they were all quite good. Being a huge fan of breakfast burgers, I really liked the Bacon Head Burger which consisted of Egg, Bacon & Cheese!!! Yummm! The Juicy Lucy Burger & Poutine were not bad too. Be warned that the poutine is far too filling if ordered as a side.
Definitely going back here to try their other stuff."
"Suggested this place to a lot of my friends! Its a small joint with serves very delicious food! Poutine is something which I tried in this place for the first time and I am addicted to it! It included fries, onions, cheese and a lot of mayo! Baguettes are also good here!"
"I guess one of those very few ""good places"" in the area.. The food is fresh and tasty
The poutines are yummmm!!
The sandwiches and baguette are good too..
The staff is quite friendly, they customise it just the way you want!
Love this place.."
The food is really great. I'm so used to ordering delivery every weekend of here now. Fish burger is amaze. I still have to try new things but this is perfect for take out.
"Just one visit and Ambretto will have your attention for a long time. Apart from being one of the few places that serve the Canadian poutine, Ambretto offers a wide variety of comfort fast food such as burgers, subs, baguettes, etc. Well they do take a while to prepare the food, but I can see why. The portions are generous, the ingredients fresh and the taste is mind blowing. I've tried the bacon poutine, the ice age burger and the juicy lucy, all of which had me eating without distractions, especially the lucy. I love how they've put good thought into the menu nomenclature, adding fun to the process of menu skimming. Although Ambretto is more of a take away joint, it does have a few...read more"
"Chota packet, bada dhamaka!!
Yeh, a small place but they serve amazing food. I liked the way they have named their dishesüò∏. The Poutines are the must!!! Service is average."
"I have edited my initial review.

Food: 4.5/5 - stunning food. The bacon head burger is mind blowing and poutines are stunning.

Earlier I had bashed Ambretto for their disfunctional website and failed attempt at building an online ordering system. However, they have now fixed it and it seems like nothing is holding this little place back. It won't be long before this becomes the new haunt for burger lovers."
Have to try the food here. It's great. The subs are way batter than Subway and are innovative. Unfortunately the sitting area is less but one can always take away. The owner is very courteous and helpful.
"Ambretto is a small fast food joint near Starcity Theatre in Matunga. Its easy to miss when you pass by. Starting with the food, it has a lot of different types of dishes likes Baguettes, Poutine, Burgers, Subs etc. The food is delicious with the right amount of veggies and sauces.
What catches your attention is the names of all the dishes. From 'Barn'ey Stinson to 12 Hungry Men, from Captain Jack Sparrow to Heisen'bird', they have it all. This is a one of a kind menu you will see and it increases the excitement about the place and the food. We ordered a Captain Jack Sparrow, its a Baguettes, like a sub, it has grilled chicken, caramelised onions, sauces with a tiny bit extra Dujon...read more"
Disappointing experience. Stale egg in my sub that was hard and non-chewable. The restaurant doesn't seem to understand the difference between pork ham and a cold cut. 2 slices of a cold cut for 180?? Seriously?? 'Eat fresh' is a concept that only Subway adheres to.
"It is very nice to see a place serving classic pocket friendly continental dishes amidst all the usual stuff we have regularly.
I reached the place in the quest for a poutine and wasn't disappointed!
For those of you who don't know what a poutine is ... It is the national dish of Canada consisting of fries, gravies and cheese curds. So does Ambretto actually serve poutine ? Well, not exactly.
What they serve is their version of the dish, which is fries, the toppings you want and an array of sauces... Close enough üòÅ
The sauces were the regulars, the fries were McCain's (yeah, I managed to have a quick peek) and the sad part, they don't have cheese curds!!
But the taste isn't anything...read more"
"It's very unusual for me to rate any place beyond 4....but Ambretto has really impressed me...like big time...the flavors and aroma were mind boggling and its definitely a must visit place for all food hoggers in Mahim!!!
When most of the restaurants and eateries very keen on offering Italian and Chinese dishes; this place begs to differ.

I loved how they've offered Poutines and Empanadas with a zing of Indian flavors... It was really delighting... A perfect amalgamation of flavours is what this place offers!!! We placed an order for Grilled Chicken Poutine along with their signature Capt. Jack Sparrow..I loved the tangy yet spicy Poutine... I customised it and asked them to add extra...read more"
"I was at a friend's place for dinner in Mahim..and they swore by Ambretto's food!! 

The Menu is fun.. the quirky food names is eye-catching.. we called for one Garlic Bread with cheese, one chicken Submarine, one Mushroom and Corn Poutine, and one Cottage Cheese Poutine.

The delivery took almost an hour to arrive for a distance for hardly 500 mtrs.. but we were well apprised of the delivery timings.. the Poutine was brilliant..cheesy..garlic mayoed.. it was very delicious and heavy.. i was full half way through!! the garlic bread with cheese was just okay.. was lacking in flavor..!

Reasonably priced.. it is a good place to order in from!!"
"ITS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO EAT AMERICAN FOOD
POUTINES ARE PREPARED BY THIER OWN STYLE WHICH IS INNOVATIVE RATHER THAN THE CHICKEN STEWED."
"The thing that made me give a chance to ambretto was the very different menu that they hav. The dishes r named after popular movie n telly characters like jack sparrow n barney.
The thing is wen h have such an innovative menu one tends to expect a lot, n believe me ambretto lives upto them.
The service n food both r really great. Have been one of their early customers n have seem their growth. The owner takes time n care to suggest the food options which is v helpful. Thanks to her i have always enjoyed the food n loved it."
"A place with 250+ votes cant be called your discovery I guess. But I wish it had been mine! Had bookmarked the place ages back after going through their menu. Fanboy paradise, with the kind of names they have given to each delicacy on their menu.

Bu the thing with having something named as legendary as jack sparrow is that you have already set high expectations before even it being delivered to your table. But boy do they live up to the hype! You have to absolutely try the grilled chicken poutine. Ultimate grilled chicken, diced to the right size with dressings which explode as soon as it reaches your palate.

Now I have been to many so called 'tex-mex' cuisines but one thing which was...read more"
"Ate Ice Age burger and Grilled chicken toasty.. Couldn't be better than this. Burger so full of mayo, you'll just drool over it ;)
Will be trying the poutines next time"
"I wonder how I ve been getting a good food experience everytime I visit a place. Well, I did not really visit this one but I ordered in some good food. The first time I asked for the 'Heisen Bird' sub. I had it custom made and it was slightly bland. I also had the grilled chicken poutine. I had never tried a poutine and this was a good call. Bed of lettuce , layered with wedges (you can ask for wedges instead of fries) , grilled chicken, veggies, cheese, mayo and some crazy delicious sauces. This ones sure to get you fat but it's worth every bite.

The second time I asked for 12 hungry men baguette, this one has chicken patties with fried and caramelised onion. The patties are well...read more"
"The food is really yummy and tasteful...we called for the mushroom and corn, cottage cheese poutines which is a big basket of French fries with veggies and sauces, a couch potato burger and a cottage country submarines...must try this place!!!!"
"Ambretto is one of the best restaurants in Mahim with a happy environment and amazing food. I've had almost, if not, everything and have never been disappointed.

The slurp fictions empanadas jalapeno cream gives a perfect tangy yet spicy taste and the grilled chicken poutine is my absolute favorite!

Perfectly grilled and mixes perfectly with the fries and blends with their sauces and to top it all off their lemon ice tea washes it all down and you're ready for round 4 üòÇ"
"A nice place to eat,especially for those who love fast food &like to try something new. My friend Divyajeet Chauhan told me about this place,the menu with the names of popular characters from movies & TV-shows sounds great but those dishes too taste great,the only problem is there's very limited space available for dine in & meal experience is not that good so the take away or home delivery option is preferable. According to me this place comes in must try place & almost all the dishes are interesting & tasty but some exceptions are there. They are very few but rest all are great. Try it once & you'll love this place. And good thing is it's not much expensive. Cost...read more"
A very good place along with some good food. Many options to select from. Poutines here is a must try. Highly recommended. Wish you all the best.
"A good place to have quick snacks. I have never visited the place yet. But, i have ordered many times from ambretto.

The food is lovely no doubt. The only problem which i feel is the portions are not value for money.

You guys should work a little on your portions and rest everything is fine.

A special mention of staff. The guys who take the order seems to be well educated as they are always polite and guide you to buy a suitable dish for you.

I am looking forward to visit this place atleast once.

Cheers!!"
"I'd been looking up places which serve Poutine and I found it. Ambretto's poutine has a lot of options of chicken to choose from. I loved the Poutine!
Speaking of the burgers, Juicy Lucy was brilliant. It had hot melted cheese oozing out of the tender chicken pattyy.
My overall experience at Ambrettos was good even if it's a really small place with only two tables."
"I visit this place quiet often, infact every time, when i go to see a movie. I love the poutines basket served with corn and cottage cheese. Its damn yummy n must to have. Its listed in perfect category ""hidden gems"".hope to visit again soon.."
"I have been eyeing this place since the time a good friend told me about its existence.

Finding myself in the area on Saturday night, I suddenly remembered and made my way towards Ambretto.

A nice small, cute, cozy place but with sinful servings.

We tried the cottage cheese poutines with friends. Much like the loaded fries of Johnny Rockets, this comes with lots of salad, tandoori cottage cheese and some brilliant sauces. Oh it was good!

Definitely see myself going there or ordering from this place soon. Next time will definitely try some of the other things they have to offer."
located just nxt to star city! its a tiny place to grab quick bites. they have really appealing menu n tastewise its good enough too only the problem is the service which is a bit to slow because its not a huge place ppl expect there food really fast apart from service its a good placee
"Where else do you find Poutine in Mumbai at such affordable rates ???
A really small place close to the Matunga railway station, with seating for hardly 8 people... but the friendly people at the counter make it a Totally Worth It experience.. With dishes like Tuna and Bacon in the menu... It is relish for foodies in search for something different."
"Locked in a small corner of Mahim lanes bang opposite is this eatery that one can not miss. Especially for those who love American fast food. Their take on the poutines - a Canadian classic, is by far the best I've had in town. I tried the bacon pouting with onion rings, mere perfection with the most perfect crisp onion rings and and bacon cooked to perfection and lovely blend of sauces. The burgers were lovely but I'd recommend them to bake their bun to add more substance.
A complete value for money & a bliss for all the students in the locality Ambretto is definitely worth it."
Haven't visited here but just ordered once! Chicken putin... Was pretty good.. Just comes with too much of mayo and coleslaw! The chicken was good though.. Would like to give it another try!
"I've wanted to visit Ambretto's since ages! Finally grabbed more than a bite there. A tiny place with all of two tables, the eatery is located near Movie Time cinema. We tried the Dexter Morgan sub and the Cold Cut poutine. The sub was delicious, the marinara sauce stole the show. Highly recommended this one! The fries within the poutine were crisp and the dish on the whole was enjoyable. Unfortunately ,the shrimp version was unavailable."
"Ambretto is amazing in 3 aspects - Menu, Food Quality and Value for Money. The only aspect of concern is the service. Agreed, it's a small place. Even the kitchen is incredibly small. However, the experience will just get better if this is taken care of. Especially when your people call up even after giving online order in clear terms and then speak in incomprehensible manner, it's damn irritating. Either stop the charade of online order or change your staff."
"Yumm! We had the poutine, veggie one, which was amazing and tried the cheese garlic bread too! Poutine was like amazing, cos we called for a second round of that and cheese garlic bread was good too. Overall an Amazing experience. Small, nice and pocket friendly place."
This is a small joint in matunga west which serves good and tasty food. The poutine is the hot selling dish there and is one of the best too. I have tried the sausage poutine and found it very filling and tasty. I like the quantity and quality of food. The ambience could improve a little. Must visit
"Date : 21st June @ 9.00 PM

Was raining heavily in Mumbai and was not keen on going to any restaurant for dinner so decided to order food from this place.

The online ordering process [through TinyOwl] was seamless and quick. Decided to have a Veg Ceasers Salad and Potato Wedges. 

The food arrived on time as indicated [inspite of the rain] so kudos for that. Now to the food,

Ceasers Salad [Veg] : packed well in a plastic casserole , which made it look appetising. The veggies were fresh however the big no-no was that they pour the salad dressing and deliver. This makes all the veggies soggy. I expected a salad dressing pouch to come with the salad but that was not the case. Also the...read more"

After reading so many reviews about ambretto i had to venture to this place which is 10 mins walking distance from my place...i went in with the recommendations from the guys who was at the counter...Ordered for the jucy lucy which was a chk burger...guess they were two jucy chk patty filled with cheese...the moment u had a bite into it u come to know why they have named this jucy lucy...then went in for bbq chk poutine which was really delicious...in fact a poutine is a meal in itself eventually had to parcel it...the ice tea along with the meal was soothing...must visit if u in this area.
Catchy names for every food item..pretty Innovative ! Had 12 horse men which was a baguette.. Got it delivered within 30min..n d wait was worth it.. Serves you good and value for money it is ...
"Disappointing, after having been forced to eat subway when I'm too lazy to do it myself. I read this menu finding it rather interesting they way it was written incorporating famous shows and movies. As well as the descriptions bringing on hunger pangs when you are in fact hungry.

The bread was thick and chewy and the filling no better. I also ordered the wedges described as 'smothered in lime pesto' Don't know what it was but it wasn't lime pesto for Sure.

"Ambretto is 5 minutes walking from my office and hence I visit this bomb place frequently.
A perfect place to hog and have some snacks in the evening. The place is very small and it has an out door seating so avoid going in the afternoon. They have these really cool names for their sandwiches and Burgers. The service is quick and I wish they kept the restaurant open on Tuesdays too. The last time I went, we ordered 'Twelve Hungry Men' , 'Captain Jack sparrow' and two Grilled chicken Poutines. Each of the dishes cost somewhere around 180 bucks and were quite filling. Captain Jack Sparrow didn't really look very appealing to us as we had some High expectations because of the way they...read more"
"""You can't judge a book by its cover""

"My introduction to Ambretto was when I tasted from my wife's order. After that, I was quite hooked. I've eaten from Ambretto on various occasion's, mostly ordered in but the best experience was eating at the outlet, nothing beats eating straight from the kitchen. But not ideal since it's quite a small place. The food is downright excellent and I've tried everything apart from the Burger. The poutine with onion rings and bacon is my favourite followed by the di'jon snow empanada and ct. jack sparrow baguette.

"Ambretto is one of my greatest zomato finds! Have ordered dinner from Ambretto often over the last year - the veg and non veg options are great! But, their poutines are absolutely out of this world fantastic! Fresh, great taste and very unique.

Truly appreciate Ambretto being on this side of town and have recommended them to everyone I know because their food is high quality and their service is reliable.

Well done, Ambretto! Keep it up!"
"Brilliant burgers! A real treasure. I am grateful they are in radar and they deliver in Mahim. It has now become my default go-to dinner place when the Bai goes missing.
The burgers are yummy. Fresh prepared patty and great seasoning. My fave burger is the fish and chips burger. Poutines are too gooey for me, but taste yum!
Pro Tip- ask for the chips on the side. Also order onion rings on the side. Assemble it before you begin."
All the foodies out there! If you all are bored of the same cuisine you eat all the time this is the place you can visit to try something new.. the food is always fresh and the taste is splendid! The best part everyone can afford eating here.. #pocketmoneyscenes
"Ordered 12 Hungry Men and Ct. Jack Sparrow Baguettes and Grilled Chicken Poutine couple of days ago. All were absolutely delicious. The baguette looks small but it packs quite a punch. They also came cut in half, so a friend and I could share it easily. My only quibble was the time it took for the order to be delivered; more than 45 minutes within Mahim was a bit too long."
"If you ever fantasize on eat street or man vs food and have strong cravings then this is the place you need to be in. A small tiny place exactly opposite star city cinema breeding some deadly sandwiches and subs. I would definitely recommend this place.


I would request for the chef to come up with more varieties of subs and burgers especially bater fried paneer or chicken."
superb place... amazing and fresh food.... hve to try it. Everythn is exceptional... pls do try the poutine.This place is one such place which serves the good food. And I thank our Gods in the heaven for creating this place. I can tell you all about this place in one sentence. Great food at great price. Thats it. All the items on menu are worth trying
"Heard about this place from a big foodie friend Raksha Riaz... thanks for that because it was worth the try!!
Ate the Ct. Jack Sparrow and 12 Hungry Men... It was quite yummy. .The quantity was tummy-filling.. it had a nice blend of flavors... good music..
A few things they really need to work on Is the slow service and really bad seating arrangement...One can't really sit outside in this heat and not more than two people can sit inside... and also i found it a little overpriced but overall a must try!"
"I believe in one philosophy about food. If people serve you good food then nothing can beat it... ambience, service, price.... nothing. This place is one such place which serves the good food. And I thank our Gods in the heaven for creating this place. I can tell you all about this place in one sentence. Great food at great price. Thats it. All the items on menu are worth trying. Place is small but that shouldn't stop one from enjoying the food this place has to offer. Each item is named after some famous hollywood character... quite amusing, isn't it! Special mentions: Chicken Poutine, Jack Sparrow and 12 Hungry Men. Its easy on the pockets and offers total value for money. Recommended."
"I ordered from this place 2 days back. I can't believe I've missed out on this place for so long. It's right next to my house and I didn't notice it.
So I ordered the non veg poutine with a choice of bacon and fries and the 12 hungry men. I absolutely loved the baguette. So good. I feel I would have liked the poutine better with chicken rather than bacon. It was good overall but didn't enjoy the bacon as much as I had expected to.
This place is definitely worth a try. The prices are reasonable and the food is worth every penny."
"If you're a meat lover, you must try the bacon poutine, upgrade to onion rings from fries for the real deal. There is a lot to try in the menu and each dish I have had from Ct. Jack Sparrow Baguette to Di Jon Snow Empanada has been finger licking yummy."
"Yummy! Garlic bread cheese.

Before entering inside no idea how itz gonna be but nyc n interesting place. I have been starcity twice r trice but this tym oly I found this place."

I am a regular at this place and it never fails to disappoint me..it's a haven for non vegetarians although vegetarian options are limited. My husband and I have tried almost everything on their menu, and each dish is rich and very flavourful. Very pocket friendly too."
"They put bacon in their poutine, that in my book is an INSTANT win.. but.... shhhhh.. don't tell anybody, or they may ban it. 

The food here is great. It's from all over the place but with an indian-mumbaiya twist to it. If you're walking by and stumble into this place, you get a belly full for great value.  One thing to note about all the sandwiches and even the poutine I've had here is that they pay attention to not just flavor, but textures. Almost every dish here, you get spicy, sweet, soft, crunchy/crispy, neatly packaged in one bite. 

Again.. did I mention the poutine? It's got cheese, lettuce, fries, bacon and sauces.. win win WIN.

This a new place opened up near starcity theatre. I wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for zomato. The food is yummy and delicious. I had ordered the Juicy Lucy burger and it was amazing! The fries were also good. Would've given it more rating if the fries were a bit more crispy. All in all it's a very good place when you're just in the mood to spoil yourself :p the pricing is also pretty reasonable

The fries with cheese and d sauces tasted very yummyyy!"
Really good food & service..! #happyTummy! :-) .
"I was pleasantly surprised the zing and punch in the baguettes and the richness in the poutines. This is soul food at its peak. Made with a lot of love and no standardisation, this is an awesome snack."
Great quality fast food in this area! Super clean and neat packaging and very flavourful food. Accommodating staff strive to take special care of you.
"The first time I passed by it, I thought it would be a run of the mill sub place. This time I went in and was quite surprised by the variety, and the owners should be applauded for putting together such a great menu for us foodies. This place shows what Engineers can do when they do something other than engineering!
Cos I hadn't planned on eating out, I ordered only Potato wedges with Lime Pesto. It's was delicious. It easily made it into my 'Last Meal' contender list.

"Let's start with the location, its bang opposite Starcity theater. It's a small joint so quite easy to miss but once you find it then you're in a small heaven. The menu they have has great names of the items they make, related to movies, TV series, sitcoms. I've been there just twice, having the Chicken Poutines and Capn. Jack Sparrow the 1st time and Chicken poutines and That 70's Salad the other time. Both were great, perfectly made. The chicken used is fresh, so are the veggies. The sauces taste great. Overall perfect."
"Ambretto ! What do I say about this place- the tex-mex cuisine here is really worth trying. This place has been on my wish list since a while and I finally visited. I tried all the sub Category they had and it was delicious specially the poutines which is supposed to be a traditional Canadian dish and hard to find it in Mumbai.
What I liked about this place is the names assigned to every dish which is really innovative and catchy such as julius Caesar for the Caesar salad and slaw shank redemption etc. staff is friendly too !

Ambretto is a great joint if you love cheese and chicken and is quite a great place for poutines and subs and beats subway in every way possible the only reason i didnt give it a five rating is that i havent been there in a while so i am not sure if their standards are the same

Have been there quite a few times now. Tried many items there, all nonveg. All i can say is that, there is more to it than what meets the eye. Agreed that its really small, sitting arrangement is really not gr8, serving period is longer than expected; but all said and done; the food is worth the wait. The baguettes, poutines, and empanadas r great. This place has become one of my favorite lunch spots, mostly when I'm post-nightduty. I wud say that it offers the most 'value for money' and filling and yummy' meal...read more"
"I went to this place on all veggiee day! So ended up eating both paneer dishes. Went there at snacks time. Found it to be perfect for snacks. Frankly there is no ambience. They hardly have 2 tables. Its a very small joint which can be easily missed.

1) A poutine- Paneer & corn cottage: It was awesome. Base was of paneer n corn, topped with French fries n with loads of Mayo sauce. I loved this dish. It was bit bland. Totally filling.

Service :3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Ambience : 2/5( Actually it wrong to rate...read more"
"Ordered from this place over the weekend cause I wanted to try something new and different.

Read the reviews about this place and they all seemed mainly positive.

Ordered the Cpt. Jack Sparrow (which was very very good. Tasty, flavorful and chunky), the 12 Hungry Men (which was slightly bland compared to the Sparrow and lacked punch in the flavor but was alright) and the Grilled Chicken Poutine (was nice and different. Something new and worthwhile in Mumbai is always welcome).

The Hungry Men was not all that great as what you would read in the menu as I'm not a big Mortadella fan and couldn't find anything else worthwhile on the menu.

"This is Best place to order from if you want yummy finger food for a lazy day. All their sandwiches are good, salads really fresh and their names are extremely innovative. Have ordered from here many times!"
"Ambretto!!! Travelled from Borivali to here on my sister's recommendation and was mesmerized. Ambretto is a refreshing food shop,then the regular food franchises. Its a small shop with a good and healthy menu. The names in menu are quite catchy. We ordered Thats 70s salad, Heisenbird and 3 Non Veg Poutines!! Everything was served in a basket, which was innovative and impressive. All the three orders were delicious but they seemed same to eye. A healthy food shop! Thumbs up!"
The salads here are good.I like the quality of the vegetables they serve in their salads.only place they need to improve is their bread.the empanada bread looked under baked and could not give me that satisfaction.
