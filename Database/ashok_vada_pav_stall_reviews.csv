Review
"Only three words- Overhyped, Overpriced, Greedy."
Not a real maharashtrian vada pav. Chutney tastes like some north indian curry. Overhyped. There are much better vada pav joints available in the same area
The vada pav here tasted really good few years back..but now the taste has gone down and just seems like an overhyped place. The chutney is very strong which overpowers the taste of everything else. Chura is very salty which makes it even worse. Also it is overpriced now. There are much better places where you can have a good vada pav at a decent price.

"It is undoubtedly overrated and overpriced vadapav. One cannot be irrational about pricing just because you have a legacy. It tastes good with powerful chuttnies. Without chutnies, it tastes no different than other vadapavs. Nothing special."
Love how the Vada pav was so crunchy and spicy. Worth spending 30rs on this one. Love how the staff is too aware and quick. Must try once.
"One word review

Over-rated....

The hype made on Instagram for this vada pav has shot it into fame. The vada is small, soggy and it's taste is nothing to write home about.
The vada pav is filled with chutneys completely overpowering every other taste.
The chura is just as soggy as the vada.

Over all, not worth the hype generated by clueless vloggers.

Skip this and enjoy a real vada pav at samarth just a few minutes away .."
"A must visit place to try vada pav.
Vada pav is hot and crispy and
the stuffing is good.
Mirchi is too spicy.
Chur served with vada pav is too oily.
Price is very affordable @30‚Çπ
Waiting time could be more and the place is crowded with lot of students.

Overall a must visit place."
"Hands down, the best vada pav in the whole of Mumbai. Head over there for quick and pocket friendly vada pav"
Delicious vada pav served in a unique way and with great taste. Haven't seen such kind of vada pav lovers standing in the que for hours just to eat vada pav. Chatni and crispy chura is the usp. üòç
"Hey!
I am from Bengaluru and was in Mumbai for a short holiday. We had heard all about Ashok Vada Pav near Kirti College - the place where the mouthwatering snack was invented. The crowd was not too bad when I was there, but considering all the hype given, I was a little dissapointed with the taste. It was definitely a very tasty vada pav...absolutely nothing wrong with it...but all the hype made me expect something heavenlyüòÇ.
It was a very different experience...have never had vada pav like here. The spice was good, especially with the chillies but the sweet chutney wasn't great.
I wouldn't call this a must visit spot, but definitely a great place for a tourist to visit."
"I had heard that this is the best vada pav in Mumbai, and it‚Äôs worth the hype. It‚Äôs a humble stall, the highlight of the vada paav is the chura and the chutney. The combination of crispy, spicy and sweet chutney is amazing. The price is a little high, 30‚Çπ for a single vada paav is a little much, but no regrets."
"I agree with the negative reviews. I can't believe the hype around this is a below average joint. The quality has gone down while the price has gone way way up. Not sure if reviews and blog posts contributed to an inflated rating. Have people lost their sense of taste due to COVID or they are blindly believing the hoopla? The wada pav costs Rs. 30 compared to Rs. 13 from a vendor down the street. The best part of the wada pav was the butter pav and the temperature of the serving (burning hot). The pav dwarfs the wada, the chura is unhealthy besan and the chutney was meh. Standing in line for 15 min was not worth the experience."
"I waited 40 mins for mumbai famous vadapav and was really disappointed, rate 30 and with small vada. This you can get at half of price in many parts of mumbai. I need to search vada inside pav as they also fill lots of churi in it. I ordered two vada pav n one churi pav so when he served me i asked were is vadapav so he said look inside the pav you will see vada. The pav was also hard to eat. If you really feel like having vadapav you can go to your local shops and buy it as that would be worth rather than waiting and buying such over priced vadapav. Also would ask some food blogger to give true review so that people would be aware of truth."

"This is the legendary place were the Vadapav was invented. I had tried their Vadapav & Chura pav.
Their vadapav is filled with chura & tikha-mitha chutney, which gives it a unique & delish taste ! But I think it is over price, as it can be for 20rs !
But overall it is wholesome & taste is good. So you can try their vadapav & churapav."
"It is said that this place first invented Vada Pav. It is a tiny stall near Kirti College that's always crowded. Their speciality is they fill their vada pav with chura (fried fitters). They even sell chura pav separately. The taste of Vada pav was good however I found this place over hyped and over priced.


In frame - Vada Pav @ Rs. 25/-
Chura Pav @ Rs. 20/-"
"Worst vada pav ever!

Selling it for 25‚Çπ, the vada pav is already ""ready"" which means you can't get according to your taste.

My vada pav was so so sweet, I couldn't eat and had to give away to a beggar!!

Worst experience of a vada pav for me. Never visiting here again."
"Super crispy Vada pavs and served with the crunch of the chura and the delightful mix of spices inside: no doubt the place is considered Mumbai's best for the go-to snack.

Be prepared for long lines waiting for a small shack like stall to dish out some delightful Vada pavs"
"One of the legendary outlets, very popular and near Kirti College, we tried the vada pav and the chura pav, I loved the chura pav. The vada pav could be priced at a little lower rate. The line was too long given the popularity."
"In past it was best place but now they reduced the size of Vada by around 50% and also reduced the amount of chura, and selling it for 25‚Çπ is really unfair for the customers"
"I have had this vada pav in the past and I have always liked it but recently i.e. on 08/03/2022 I had this vada pav, I was suprised to find out that the size of the vada has reduced considerably and the most of the pav was filled with chura. It's is certainly not worth Rs.25/- and to add to the nonsense they had made it sweet. I am very disappointed with the quality and quantity of the vada pav. The staff also is very arrogant, is like they are not bothered now after achieved the fame for so many years."
"This is the best vada pav Mumbai city can offer. Don‚Äôt think too much, drive to it right now. The Chura gives a unique crunch - and the dry masala is made from about 19 ingredients."
I have grown up eating this vada pav and so I do make it a point to try the vada pav here once in a while. The taste has definitely changed a little bit and the vada has grown smaller. But this is place is always packed so its definitely worth a try.
I visited this place recently and was flattered by this vada pav. It costs 25Rs but its totally worth it.The essence of this vada pav is Chura. This Chura brings Crispiness in Vada pav. They also sell Chura pav for 20Rs. Also the Masala is spicy and tangy which makes it more tasty.There is no doubt Ashok vada pav is considered as one of the best vada pav in Mumbai. If you are in Mumbai you should definitely visit this placeüòã‚ù§

"Spicy vada pav around the corner. Good taste. The shop looks very normal but the taste of the vada pav is awesome. They charge just Rs20 for a vada pav.
Chutney needs to be spicier.
They make so thick chutney which I don't like. They only sell vada pav and water. that's all."

"The Best Vada pav in Mumbai . I can go on n on about this Vada Pav. In simple words,
Wanna feel the vibes of Mumbai do visit this stall."
"I went here 3years ago. And back then the vada pav was for around 25rs. And i felt it was a bit too much. So yes the price is for the fame this place has. I have had better vadapavs in Bombay. But if you just want to visit this place to have a tick in your places to visit, then go for it."
I like vada pav very much the vada pav was very tasty and the quality and quantity was very good it is very tasty
"Overpriced and overrated!!
Tastes below average.
Found a scrubber in the vada and the owner did not even have the courtesy to apologize.
Worst vada pav experience.
Do not try this vada pav as it can be injurious to health."
"Mumbai is known to serve the best vada pao in India and mind you, this place serves the best Vada pav in Mumbai. The right mix of chatnis and mixture (small peices of pakora) makes the vada pao totally different and amazing."
"Ashok Vadapavüëé
An Average vada pav costs around 25Rs .Ashok Vada pav must have served great vada pav at one time, the same does not hold true today. There are dozens of places that serve way better vada. Was too hyped for their masala pav but that masala doesn't have any taste.
I would call this Overrated nothing else."
"Online delivery chalu kara oo saheb, No.1 vadaPav in mumbai, i feel their USP is their Tikha(Green) and mitha chutney, uske bina vadapav he adhura inka.. mindblowing"
"This is my favorite Vada Pav joint in Mumbai. I have always had a Hot and Fresh Vada pav at this place. I like their unique style of serving the Vada pav with Choora. They also sell only Choora Pav which is also unique. The Vada Pav is filled with Green Chutney, Tamarind Chutney and Red Sukha Chutney. I had got my Vada Pav packed. The Pack was filled with Choora and green chilies."
Need to improve the waiting period...other than that everything is excellent... specially the chutney is awesome
"Read Any ""Best Vadapavs of Mumbai"" Lists on Internet & You will surely notice this name among the top 3 - "" Ashok Vada Pav ""üëà

The owner of Ashok Vada Pav, Mr Ashok Vaidya is credited for inventing vada pav. Located near Kirti College, Dadar, Ashok Vadapav is very popular amongst the Mumbaikars so expect some waiting time.üòÖ

The vada is crispy & extra choora add up more crunchiness. The real magic maker is the special chutney which provides the real flavour that everyone craves about.üòã

The price of Rs. 25 is a bit higher considering the vada pav cost in Mumbai but that's mainly because of the brand or popularity that Ashok Vadapav carries.üëà

"""Ashok vada paav"" is one of the oldest vada paav sellers in Mumbai. Very famous place in Dadar. Talking about the food we ordered
1. Butter vada paav
2.crispy vada paav
The vada paav size was little big from the average vada-paav. Taste was out of this world. Never tasted so much flavours in a vada paav. Service was good. Prices are litte high."
"Obviously they are King of Vadapav world in Mumbai, Hot & Spicy Vadapav & Crispy Churapav from here is something one cannot miss out while living in Mumbai.. Only thing is that I feel it's bit pricey as normally vadapavs are available between 12-18 rs and here it costs around 22-25.. Still gonna eat anyways üòÅ"
Another iconic place where I have been visiting since my childhood to have crispy vada pav. I bet you wouldn't get crispy vada pav anywhere other than Ashok vada pav. Whenever I visit Dadar or nearby places I won't forget to have this iconic and best vada pav.
One of the best vada pav i have ever tasted. Filled with crispy besan fries and vada and spicy sauce. Must try!!!
"""Ashok Vadapav"" is an absolute delight for vadapav lovers. Though it is just a stall the satisfaction of customers is on next level. It has raised the standard of the normal vadapav and making the maharashtrian cuisine famous all over city. I tried churi paav And classic vadapav. Both were just phenomenal. Taste is fabulous and worth the money. Please visit this place for next level Vadapavs...."
"I didn't find their vadapav to be as good as their hype. Its just normal vadapav with chura. They didn't even apply the chutney properly, it was mainly on the end part of the pav(hinge) so it got soggy there. The vada is average at best. Neither vada nor pav felt fresh or hygienic. Its fine to try if you're nearby but not worth travelling here"

"Being one of the best rated vada pav in Mumbai, this place is crowded no matter what time you visit. However I feel it is over hyped & over rated. The only thing people talk about is either the chura or the chutney. The taste of the chutney is so overpowering, you don't know what the vada tastes like. It's lost in the overpowering spices of the chutney. I think that's the whole trick. Try having just the vada.. it's average."
"Ashok vadapav aka Kirti College vadapav center is a stall near Kirti College dadar which serves one of the finest and best vada pav in Mumbai. The speciality of Ashoka vadapav is the chura and the chutney which makes an ordinary vadapav stands out of all food. You can have this vadapav at anytime and it will satisfy your soul.
The ashok vadapav is priced at 25‚Çπ which is worth every penny, there is also chura pav available at 20‚Çπ
I would suggest that the vadapav should be consumed visiting the stall so that it can be eaten hot because if you have it parcel the pav absorb the chutney and the the pav becomes soggy

"Ashok Vada Pav

Dadar West

You will come across Vada Pav, true love of a Mumbaikar in almost every lane of Mumbai and this is one of the best place to have one.
The special thing about this place is the green chutney which is damn tempting and the chura with which they serve the Vada Pav. Once you try, you‚Äôll definitely visit frequently.
Quite easy to locate when you ask Kirti College."
"Vada pav I felt was expensive. They have increased the price to 5 rupess/- so vada pav and chura pav 25/- each

Taste 4/5
Over all a good experience. Worth trying once."
This is yet another favourite in the Shivaji Park and Prabhadevi area. Ive been here since many many years and his vada pav is unmatched. This is something that you should not miss if you‚Äôre a vada pav fan.
Quite satisfied with the taste. But I guess it's over hyped. There are many amazing Vadapav stalls all around Mumbai. I did a poll on my Instagram channel for the best Vadapav and Ashok Vada Pav got the Maximum votes. Quick service and crunchy Vadapav Served with an amazing view.
"This is THE BEST vada pav I have had till today, as soon as you take the first bite, there's a burst of flavours in your mouth.
The softness from the pav, the crunchiness from the churra, spiciness from the chutneys, it's just perfect. I also love their churra pav. This place is crowded at all times and you will have to wait for 5-10 mins, but it's totally worth the wait."
One of the jewels of street food culture of Mumbai! The vada pav and chatni was fabulous! Do take a stop if u r in the vicinity.

"Ashok Vada pav is one of the best place to have vada pav in Mumbai. It is near kirti college , Dadar.
Truly speaking it is the first thing I had after stepping out after months. The vada pav is of a medium size filled with lots of churi. The mithi chutney and suki chutney makes it taste even better.
Cost of 1 Vada Pav is Rs 25
It's is expensive compare to other places in Mumbai, but each bite of this is worth the value.

Taste 4.5/5
Hygiene 4/5
Price 3.5/5"
I had heard so much about Ashok and I can say how true everything was!! The Vada Pav is AMAZING. It is one of the best Vada Pavs you can eat in Mumbai. The location is convenient and the stall is neat and clean. The service is really quick. It is definitely not light on the pocket as compared to other stalls in Mumbai but it is worth every penny!
"The place is over hyped and so is the vada pav which is for Rs 25. Very costly. The main gimmick is to serve is piping hot and so always manages to pull crowd. Since most of the time it is not available and then people start gathering around. Saddens to say it's not really tasty when cools down. Either have it hot or else it's tasteless.
Waste of money. Over rated!"
"As a very senior ex colleague of mine (non Mumbaite - absolute foodie) whom I had taken to have the Vada Pav here had said ""this is the end, there is nothing beyond this"".
Food, much like art is a very personal choice subject as well as an ever evolving one and hence it is remotely possible to name one item as the best ever in it's own right/range.
I would nevertheless stick my neck out and say the Piping Hot Vada Pav with Chura and all the chutneys in it of this place is one of the finest food items I have had and find it unlikely for any in future to beat it as well. Dint even question whether this is the best vada pav - it absolutely is.
And mind you I have had almost all...read more"

"Every nook and corner of the city is dotted with vada pav stands. To be recognised amongst this lot is truly a talent. Aside the hype, it's hugely debatable whether it's the best vada pav in the city but Ashok Vada Pav aka Kirti Vada Pav is definitely worth a visit. It is extremely popular and has seen old timers vouching for this fact that since two decades, the taste has been consistent. The standards set by Ashok sir himself remain unmatched. The city's favourite snack was given a twist by incorporating the choora along with the chutney inside the pav. The place always draws a crowd, the cause likely being that this is a standalone shop which doesn't believe in deliveries. The city...read more"

Certainly the place has a very authentic taste to offer. Service could get slow during rush hours but keeping that aside it is a good one to give a try."
"This is not just ordinary vada pav stall. It is famous and popular vada pav stall in Mumbai with swift and quick service, great taste, and quality.

There is no specific time where I would tell there won't be crowd or rush. Right from the opening hours till closing this stall is completely crowded. The major positive point is they cater rush in minutes. They really serve quickly and perfectly. Each serving has the same taste and proportion. You can customize your spice level as per your taste buds.

No seating arrangements and having vada pav standing is all together a different satisfaction.
