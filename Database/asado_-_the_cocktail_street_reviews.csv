Review
"Bad food, very ok ambience. when i called up for booking i was told that the place is full and i can possibly try to get the table on first come first serve basis. a few mins later called again, they happily took the booking. strange experience. when we reached it was completely empty and remained so till we left. only some small party was in progress in the interior. overall not worth the rating given on zomato - my experience makes me wonder if zomato ratings are reliae any more."
"Went there last Wednesday night in happy hours and the place was almost empty. Music was good. The place was neat and clean with wood tables. On Wednesday they offer unlimited sangria and mojito on the house for ladies, but my frnds ended up with bad taste of the same. We had vodka shots in happy hours, but it was not good what we get in normal hours. Taste was different. If u are visiting in happy hours then go on your own risk. Experience was much lower than what we have expected."
"This is a new pub for sure. Never seen or heard about it before. I was clueless. Cocktails and drinks selection is very good. They have a big drinks menu. Me and my sister tried a few starters . Yummm.

Ambience - good
Service- good
Food- good
Drinks- good
Pricing - bad
Value for money - average"
It's amazing place in bandra very tasty food n I liked their cocktail . .. how they make coctail at our table it's awesome when I went there . THERE WERE CELEBRITIES WHO CAME FOR DINNER it's ambiance is mind blowing
We have been waiting for a restaurant that tickles your taste buds and finally the wait for it was over!Allow me to brief you about the place which was as unique and as different as its name 'ASADO.' The place was charmed us at first glance itself. The open bar was well lighted and separated the two zones which are 'SMOKING' and 'NON-SMOKING'. The decor was neat and clean with wood tables while the music was upbeat with latest tracks on the groove. Once we were seated at our table our journey of tasting began. We started off with cocktails with very different names to them . One was called 'Breezy Bulb' the the other one was 'Cactus Carnival.' We also sipped on some Sangria which was...read more
"Girls night out that actually ended on the perfect note !!!

I absolutely loved this place.
Fantastic food and even better drinks ❤❤❤

We've found a new favourite place and we love it. 😍😍😍"
"Oh God do I love this place! Girls night out was the best here. I'll travel across Mumbai for the mojitos here, and that's saying a lot. The food is also an incentive to travel. The butter-garlic prawns, wasabi prawns, the loaded potato skins and the BBQ paneer. Try all. ALL. ❤️"
"ASADO The Cocktail street!! An international bar feel with prim and prom décor. This place has a different vibe all together. I have been to many bars  at various locations in  bandra & khar West  must say is the best in terms of their interiors very cosy warm.  Their set up for the bar is amazing  Since its open ,their outdoor sitting is nice too and one advantage of sitting outside is that you can get  to smoke as well as socialize ,While the inside is louder and you can let your hair loose and shake your leg until wee hours

The awesome thing about this place is their staff is very well trained and always enthusiastic to give awesome service to their guests. Good welcoming warm...read more"
"Really rude people, for the amount they charge they should take the staff through etiquette lessons.We had a disagreement on the bill amount, where we highlighted that we were charged for an extra round of drinks (which is not impossible). I mentioned I kept a record of the number of drinks (which is also quite normal!!) I was told ""madam you must have also recorded time, why don't you show us that""
Completely disappointing behavior, suggest they realize it's a service industry. Being rude and cheeky isn't going to get them anywhere. If I can afford 3 rounds, 1 more is fine if we actually had it!!!"
"I went to Asado when it was weekend and full party season, still we found the place pretty much empty and not happening. But people turned up late to the place. The ambiance is dark and cave like. The music and alcohol are good. The table allocation is such that you can sit without worrying about getting disturbed by ongoing party.
The alcohol is decent and you can find few brands which are not available at normal clubs/pubs. The place is good for couples/smaller groups."
"Visited early evening ..was greeted with warmness by a hostess which placed us smiling to start with.

Ambiance 4.5/5:Asado makes us feel warm and romantic ,just love the liveliness. .hash tags. .open section with bar..inside section with beautiful art work ..

Service 4/5:very humble ,tentative and prompt best thing is they explain their cocktails and food when we want to order ofcourse by first checking on our palate very impressive.

Music 5/5:Absolutely perfect with the evening we were the first to entre and left by midnight after 10:30 music was louder & took the tempo of people higher and by then the place was packed.

Went there for the Halloween party and it literally turned up to be a Halloween with nobody else in the pub... A boring experience... The service is good.. the snacks are very very average and can be avoided...
"My idea of the perfect date is a going to a place like Asado; dim lit street lights that flank the great paintings and wallpapers, a Dj who plays on your request, a caricature artist, like food and drinks were not enough!. It was my second visit to Asado and I am sure I am going to go back for more and more."
"Went there last night post 11.15pm and the place was almost empty .... DJ was blasting music for the only table that was occupied .... The place has an outdoor seating as well ....

Quickly ordered :

1) Bourbon Smash : bourbon with bitters and caramel ... The drink was alright ...

2) Lava Grill : stuck to paneer and side of sautéed mushrooms ... Big chunk of soft paneer served on a sizzling platter with mushroom and a smallest portion of beans...the dish was ok

3) Pan crusted Tofu : this appetiser was the winner ... But no trace of blue cheese as mentioned in the menu ...

We had a lot more expectations from the place .... However, maybe being a weekday night it was slow ..."
"Asado is rather small and unassuming from the outside, but has a nice evening vibe all the same. My friend and I went there for drinks since they offer unlimited mojitos and sangria on the house for ladies on Wednesday, and ended up having a pretty good time.

We also ordered a portion of veg nachos with our mojitos, and they were pretty good. The accompanying guacamole was amazing! I intend to go back in order to sample their mains, which sounded delicious but I couldn't try them as I was short on time."
'The Cocktail street' as the name suggests has cocktails which not only taste good but very well presented and decently priced. Crowd is mostly teenage and the music is too loud for this size of place though the DJ was playing good music. Mexican hat cocktail which is served in a ceramic hat was something different to look at. But they need to keep more such hats as one has to wait till the other customer finishes their drink. Loved the way in which they served the long island ice tea. Its best to try their cocktails rather than going for regular beers or drinks. Veg nachos were good. Truffle parmesan fries with mint & wasabi dips were also good. Grilled veg flat bread is also worth...read more
"I went here to celebrate my special day on the basis of such amazing reviews I saw on Zomato! Man, I was not disappointed at all !!

Ambience First -> One of the very few places in Bandra  where you can see a lot of thought put into innovative ideas, little details  and mesmerizing outcome of all these ! The first thing that catches your eyes is the adorable  Entrance which made me feel ticklish (happily ;) ). Once I crossed , I was awestruck with the creativity. Hats off ! You can have delicious dinner with good Dj playing some awesome music  with dine ! A perfect 5 on Ambience

A beautiful place for an evening out with your girls! Go on Wednesdays for their ladies night. We ended up having some of the chicken and prawn appetizers which were quite good! The nachos deserve a thumbs up! Simple but effective!
"A wonderful place for cocktails! Tucked on s v road in Bandra this place looks small from the outside but it beautiful from the inside. Rocking music and yummy drinks. Try the Nachos, bbq chicken pizza and the barbeque chicken starters! Also ladies - do drop in on Wednesdays for the ladies night!"
"This is probably one of the nicest places for cocktails and appetisers! Yummy drinks with an awesome ambience makes this place awesome! Try the barbeque cottage cheese for those who love the sweet and spicy taste of the sauce. Another favourite was the nachos! Crispy chips with fresh tomato, beans, cheese and chicken! Two thumbs up from me!"
Had heard and read alot about this place through different friends and on zomato. However for some unknown reasons we dint have the same experience. so we opted for this place to celebrate a friends birthday. Accordingly had done the reservations well in advance thinking tht this place would always be full..we reached the venue at the stated time at around 9 and shocked to see that the place was empty with just one table occupied besides ours n that too of their outdoor seating..On our request we ask them the big table at the corner and luckily we get it.. The only good part of this place is their amazing offers on drinks basically their happy hours. Foodwise the menu is very precise and...read more
"I've got very mixed reviews of this place. Ambiance- bang on, wins hands down. But that's precisely where the goodness of this place ends. I've heard the cocktails look splendidly wonderful and I didn't really try them, so maybe I missed the essence of this place . We ordered an appetiser, basa in barbecue sauce, and such a let down it was. The fish had a stale taste, wasn't cooked well and the presentation too was lack lustre. To make things worse, when I was getting off m chair, there was a nail under the table which ended up ruining my face pants😡. All in all, a very sad experience, from a place I've been looking forward to go to since a long long time."
"Our gang made a adhoc plan to have meet up on Wednesday night & wanted to explore a new joint. Thought of exploring Asado as had got some reviews from friends. But to b honest was slightly disappointed. The ambience is ok types, the sad part was there was no crowd even till 11pm. Hardly 2-3 tables were occupied. May be because of a Wednesday 😩. The cocktails were innovative & the food was really good. Another thing that let us down was the music. The DJ just could not get the crowd tapping their foot. The staff was cooperative .Overall was a ok experience. Hopefully this place is better on weekends."
"ASADO The Cocktail Street , the concept started around seven months back. Before which it was a Fine Dinning. Location wise is Good, right on S V Road, before Gaiety Galaxy Theater  (If you are coming from Andheri to Bandra). Went on a Monday Night (JULY 2016) along with my Wife. Ambience is Very Nice. They have a DJ, but thankfully the Music was not Blasting."
Lively place for a Saturday night!! Extremely elaborate menu of Cocktails and the Tiki ones.. Food is decent.. very innovative ways of serving cocktails just adds a zing to your experience. To top it all it was DJ OM who played amazing commercial n desi tracks!! A place you can visit with friends on a weekend ( if you like Bollywood its the place to be)
"So I planned a dinner with my sister and had this place on my mind 'cause I love exploring new places. Reading the reviews and seeing the rating, I was really excited to get in there. Well, I did get in there and to me it wasn't even a bit of what I was expecting it to be. The ambience is quite chill. Super loud music was not really fun though. Also, I would really suggest them to get some good lights above each table just in case we want to see what we are eating :-p 'cause I could barely see what was on the plate. Coming to the food, I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't extraordinary too. And most importantly, having a common washroom for guys and girls is just not cool. So, bottom...read more"
Best place n the best locality....The place is a heaven for cocktail lovers...The freak shakes are eyecatching...The food is average n taste...The presentation of food and drink is mindblowing...the ambience can be given 4/5.The crew is friendly.
"The Asado cockttail street  has become the most favourite . The intriguing door opens to a beautiful set up of different kind of ambiance. With indoor, outdoor  you have plenty of options for seating. My favourite one is definitely the outdoor one. 

The menu has cocktails like Rum Barrel.. The wonderful sweet seduction looks beautiful and has real  strawberry  essence. since we were 12 of us ordered treasure island it comes with fresh fruits,tonns of alcohol must be definitely 4.5lts and the way it was presented  vow what a drama!!!!!Felt in Heaven

"Well I visited this place as late at night for clubbing, hence didn't get much time to explore the place and food.
But I ordered the nachos which was delicious and quite possibly the best one I have ever had.
Also their pineapple based tikki pukka was very refreshing and one of the best I have ever had.

Place is small, with mostly college crowd..but the music was really nice."
A good party place for a Saturday night specially the bollywood music which is the highlight of this place... The plating of food and the way they serve drinks is something different... I enjoyed the squid calamari and tacos... Must try specially on a bollywood night...
"This place dishes out some fantastic cocktails paired with great music to instantly get you grooving on the dance floor! We kicked off the night with some sangrias and a few rum based concoctions which were delightful. The food was below average though. We had the Fiery habanerro barbequed prawns which wasn't fresh and we had to get the waiter to take it back. It was replaced with the same preperation in Chicken. The sauce was really zingy, spicy and had a great kick to it. It's a shame though that the chicken was chewy and tough, probably cause it was overcooked. Next we had the 4 mushroom fettucine which was just okay.

Nevertheless, a great place to chill, drink and shake a leg. Do...read more"
Awesome cocktails!!!....loved this zombie cocktail...cool place to hang out...ambience is good too..being a cocktail lovers tried cocktails in many places in Mumbai but this one was by far best in zombie...must try!!!
"It was my first time to Asado and the experience was amazing. Located near Bandra talao, the place is very easy to find. The outside of the restaurant decked up of wood and bamboo which reminiscences of beach shacks. Inside it was all Italian with fancy wall arts, cloudy ceiling and street fusion lights. Don’t judge the restaurant by its name; though it has an extensive menu of cocktails and drinks, the food menu is no less. We went for the carnival brunch menu plus à la carte. Here are some of the Veg dishes we” tried and tasted”,

1) Fire roasted cherry tomato with fresh fennel bisque – This has become one of my favorite soup, Recommend.

"Get your freak on
Asado Cocktail Street, Bandra!

No great memories have be created by drinking water! My idea of the perfect date is a place like Asado. Dim lit street lights that flank the great paintings and wallpaper, a Dj who plays on your request, a caricature artist, like food wasn't enough!
It was my second visit to Asado and I am sure I am going to go back for more and more.
Asado Cocktail Street, a name that couldn't be more clearer is famous for its cocktails and other drinks. They have one of the best collections in the city. Their food menu goes hand in hand with the drinks making it a super combination! Friday and weekend nights is the best time to be here.

"Came here with wifey and friend on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised to find NO ONE.
Small place and lethargic staff. I dont think the server knew the menu well (or maybe ot was his first day). All he could muster was 'yes sir'/ 'no sir'. Asked him the specialities in flatbread, response was 'yes sir'.
Finally I went ahead and order bbq chicken flatbread, nachos, beer battered prawn tacos.
Food : 4/5
Drinks with theatrics : 4/5
Service : not upto the mark. 2.5/5

"Saturday night at 9 pm and the place is semi empty thanks to the long Ganesh Chaturthi weekend. The music here was too loud, not to mention reparative. We stuck to the tried and tested Heineken (2 bottles) and Old Monk (120 ml) + Coke routine. As for the food, we had the Panko Crumbed Chicken Supreme and Fiery Chicken Leg Habanera Barbeque. Both were delicious! Although the French Fries were a little too crispy for my liking. Next was Chipotle Baby Chicken Leg with Barbeque Sauce and Potato Mash, Garlic Bread and the Mushroom Fettuccini dish. The latter was out of the world! A must try! The Garlic bread was, again, too crisp for my liking. The Chipotle chicken was citrusy and tangy, mash...read more"
"I've visited this place multiple times and have had mixed experiences. The difference was finally resolved when I visited them this Friday - the place was deserted at around 12:00 (not too late for a club). Later we found out that it is much more popular on Wednesdays and Saturdays when they have bollywood music - which tied in with a few of my earlier visits where we found the place grooving with decent crowd
That said - the place is overall nice, but the food needs an upgrade. The 'fiery BBQ cottage cheese' was too spicy (and I like spicy food) and the 'grilled veggies with cottage cheese' was ok but lacked any distinctive flavoring
The cocktails at the place are decent"
"The best cocktail I have had in Mumbai.. Their serving style is extremely sassy too.. Went last evening with husband and tried Tiki Mexicana, comes in a hat and serves 2, Zinger with fresh fruits, they muddle up fresh fruits and make this cocktail right at your table, and the ever famous LIIT came in this huge flask with smoke all over, the best LIIT I have had.. We didn eat much as we were busy drinking so we just tried their truffle fries with parmesan , again the best in it's league.. Only disappointment is too much of taxes.. For all this the bill should be 1700 however with taxes we ended up paying 2135..guess good things come with a price.. Overall a must must go place for their...read more"
"A friend's birthday car up and we decided to try this place. Have heard a lot about its cocktails.

To start off, we were not disappointed, the treasure chest, and the bucket etc. To serve drinks in were awesome. Perfect cocktails.

But only that isn't enough! The place inside could use some more light Firstly.

The food. It has to be the extreme opposite of the cocktails. The pizza was really bad and so was the mezzo platter. The kebabs and the wings didn't impress at all either.

Improve you food guys, no matter how much a person drinks, good food is a necessity.

Very few places in Mumbai serve fajitas. When I saw those on the menu I was keen on trying some. I don't regret my choice. Since this place is famous for cocktails we ordered a few of their famous cocktails. The presentation and the taste were both impressive. I would recommend this place to have some beer based cocktails. I enjoyed the sangria too."
"We truly live in an era where we want everything on our terms and conditions and above that VARIETY.. Cause Boredom! Thats what Asado is all about!

Located at 5 mins walking distance from Bandra's famous Gaiety Galaxy, Asado on the very first glance seems to appear like a Goan Shack. The thatched roof and the cozy lounge area makes you feel instantly relaxed! The interiors quite live upto the name with painted walls with tiny human figures peeping outside the windows and lined of birds on the ceiling giving the whole street feel!

"Thank You! I came to ‘Asado’ to celebrate my wife’s birthday and honestly I have no qualms of having zeroed on this alternative. To begin, ‘Asado’ in the only restaurant in an almost deserted lane. We had reached the place around 9 and the place was moderately filled (maybe weekday). Dimly lit with an al-fresco and indoor seating arrangement, the place has an open bar and the DJ was continuously belting out the some of our favourite tunes. The somber atmosphere was soothing and set the mood right.

Located barely 20 steps away from the busy Gaiety-Galaxy junction in Bandra West on even busier S V Road, walk in and get transported to a different world than the honking horns and bustling traffic outside.

"The wowtables experience at asado was quite something... 1.2k for a 5 course meal of a set menu of soup, salad, pasta/risotto, main course and dessert!! We were super stuffed!!
Pros: super value for the price; attentive staff; lovely ambience
Cons: some of the dishes like the mushroom soup and the John dory main course were quite salty; the basic pesto spaghetti I ordered was too creamy (hello, no cream in pesto!!); they need to invest in a few new CDs coz the retro medley CD played on loop

Will definitely visit again!"
"A Sunday afternoon well spent with the relaxing and sumptuous carnival brunch at Asado the cocktail street. The experience of a lively environment with lovely ambience and stomache ravishing food made my entire day.

MICHELADA WITH CORONA BEEER: A Mexican spiced beer cocktail quenching all the tiredness of the day. Now Sunday is meant to be lazy.

TRIFLE GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES: Hot and crunchy fries served with two exotic dips. It was a good start specially with the drink.

To describe about the place I would say that the place is really well made, good interiors and it actually lets you feel that you are sitting on a street. Dim lights add to the beauty of the interiors. To talk about the service I would like to say that the staff is warm and they are ready to assist you. 

As the session went on  the Bar tender made a cocktail in front of me with all...read more"
"Ups 👍🏻
-great food
-good choice of dishes & cocktails
-outside sitting gets air conditioning and smoking is permissible
-Prompt service
-flexible staff

Downs 👎🏻
-happy hours only limited to one type of a drink in each category ( eg. only kingfisher in beer)
-dull interiors with poor lighting
-no crowd at peak time of the evening ( might work for some folks)

Verdict :
Food 3.5/5
Value for money 2.5/5
Table reservation definitely not required."
"Asado means Mexican food to me. It's probably the perfect place for a date night - romantically dim, candle light all over, stunning cocktails and pretty old school music. 

Recommend:
Zinger - choose your herbs, flavoring and poison and watch it being turned into a cocktail 
Truffle Garlic Parmesan fries 
Barbecue paneer 
Tex mex potato skin 
Grilled vegetable flat bread 
Tres leches cake 

I started with a cocktail called zinger - they make the entire thing right in front of you. It's whole mint, rosemary, pineapple, watermelon and orange. They crush it right in front of you and then stir it with some vodka and some lemon juice and fizz. Extremely refreshing - the flavor of the...read more"
One of the craziest new places in Bandra . Innovative Cocktails + Good Ambience + Insane Food = The Perfect Recipe for a good night. Don't forget too try their Tiki Cocktails & Treasure Island. Its a must visit.
The three milk cake here is a must have! Amazing food and even more amazing cocktails.. The animal fries were delicious and generous with dips. Tiki Mexicana is an amazing share and value for money!
"Stumbled upon Asado last weekend.. This place has an amazing vibe to it, with the dimly lit interiors and a menu with a varied cocktail options. There's a cocktail for every spirit that you can think of. Their Hyde and seek cocktail and sangria is a must have. We even called for their zinger which was infused with fresh fruit and was really yummy. For desserts you have to try their tres leches cake which is the best I've ever had!"
"THEY WILL CHEAT!!!!
Be Careful

A random plan on a Saturday night...most places were full...but this place apparently wasn't...in retrospect I kinda know y...but will get there...
Heard the place had some amazing cocktails...so that got my wife and friends excited....
To start with the place is dark...to dark...you practically need to use the torch light flash of your smartphone to even read the menu...
The music is loud...a bit to loud for my taste atleast...but not complaining cause ppl seemed to be fine with it...
Now the drinks are presented pretty well...it does have a certain theatre to it...the quantity for the price is a bit questionable...but still worth it...
They were pretty...read more"
"Asado The Cocktail Street

Asado is the place which stands out differently for their variety of cocktails. Its located near Bandra Talao and diagonally opposite to ‘ The Daily’ so finding a place won’t be a problem. I’ve went with my friend to Asado and really had a great time. “Asado” means Barbeque in Spanish. But, they do not tries just Spanish Food but also tries South American, Mexican and few Italian dishes too.

Ambience: (4.5/5)

The place is looks quite attractive from outside. When you enter here, you will not be disappointed. The Ambience is Beautiful. Dim Lights and Candles on the table tops makes the place more beautiful and romantic. DJ was playing Romantic...read more"
"My first time here. Music is all Bollywood and Loud Hindi songs both old and new ones.
Pathetic food. Everything is a disaster. And every second thing in the menu seems ""unavailable"".
Only saviour is innovative drinks and decent music."
"A happening place in the happening suburb of Bandra. Right on SV road, easy to locate with ample space to park. The ambience inside almost takes you to streets of Europe!!
The food was good. However as the name suggests, it's a place for drinks... Which we don't partake. And it was a little disappointing that they didn't have any much variety in mock tails other than the standard ones. But, as the overall food and ambience were good, it was a good experience."
"Loved the food the first time we went here, the soft tacos, burrito bowl everything was great. The second time here was quite a let down, the taco was stale and oily..🙄"

Must haves: Hyde and seek, Tiki mexicana, rum barrel, fiery habanero chicken, and and tres leches.

At the end of a long, tiring day at work, potent cocktails is what one needs, and Asado - The cocktail Street, staying true to its name, this Latin grill managed to provide just that. The mixture will manage to blow your mind and the bites pair perfectly with the concoctions.

Rum barrel: Our night began with this tropical cocktail. Seriously, what's not to like!? Its incredible and something you could reward yourself with at the end of the day.

"Ferrari makes cars. Omega makes watches. Louie Vuitton makes apparel. Jimmi Choo makes shoes. Chanel makes makeup. Fendi Casa makes furniture. Dior makes perfumes. Cartier makes jewellery. Mont Blanc makes pens. Oakley makes sunglasses. Apple makes computers. Asado makes cocktails.

Not everyone likes all those brands but they still do what they do.

Although we missed what they do best, putting in perspective the rest.
