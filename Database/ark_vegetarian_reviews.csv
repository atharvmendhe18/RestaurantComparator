"I visited this place last weekend for lunch ad i really loved the place and foods.
 I tried the Punjabi dishes Paneer Tikka masala with nan and Dal Tadka with Jeera Rice it was awesome and also the service. The staffs were courteous and well trained. One should visit this place they serve great quality food and loved the Ambience."

"Food was decent, not extraordinary taste but good. The waiters were a little unprofessional, like touchy when serving and also we were hit twice by their serving plates. The ambience is decent. Not too rich. Overall a casual dining place."
Lip smacking food..so delicious. Reasonable rates. Loved the tandoori platter. Great experience
"A very late review but yeah finally doing it .!! Had been to this place . The place looks premium with some good decor . Also the hygiene is very well maintained . Coming to the food part I had ordered for starters Paneer Mastani Tikka . The taste was good and had a smoky flavor on it . For the main course had ordered Paneer Butter Masala , Ajwain paratha , Butter Roti and Cheese Kulcha. The taste was pretty nice not too spicy . However portion size was less for the price it is kept at . And had ordered two coolers Berry Blast and Kiwi Fever absolute disappointment with both as they had just loads of syrup mixed with Sprite and no natural taste to it ..

"ARK is the wonderful place for dine and chill-out with your best buddies. The Ambience is so pretty good. They were also play live music for mood refreshment. The food is good with good price. Staff is also polite in nature.
Overall excellent experience, must visit once."
Okay Kind of Place. A Normal Dine-In Resto but Heavy on the Pocket. It will Cost You more than You Think even for two. Food is Basic. Staff is Good. Family Restaurant. Only for Veggies ofcourse. No Discounts.
"Food is decent! If one is looking for dine out with family, this is a good option! I and my foreign partner had a dinner here. Food is great for them too!"
"Kinda my 2 nd home now.. Almost there on alternative weekends for family gatherings !!

Jalapeno poppers kurkure Kabab Veg Laziz Panner Jalfrezi Bhurji Masala Roomali Tokari all items are lovely .. Common items but taste is exquisite ..

I have always been with family or get togthers and they able to handle it very well ..Good Service with Excellent Food"
We visited this place right after watching a movie we ordered daalrice as well as cheese garlic naan all of these stuff we're good . We had paneer chilli and jalapeno poppers for starters and ambience was too good

Dishes recommended-
Manchow soup

"Very nice place for vegetarians. Would recommend to go to this place.
Good Service and they are very polite to customers.
Quality and quantity of the food is very nice."
"Looks like a small place from outside but pretty good seating place inside.
Brocolli corn soup was very sweet and watery.
Punjabi paneer butter masala is good in taste and quality.
Mix veg subzi is average and could have been better.
Dal rice had very low salt we had to add more to get proper taste.
Prices are high at this place. With the kind of food experience I would say it's a little overpriced."
"Good restaurant, good ambience good service, good food could improve in some grey areas like moctail glasses needs an upgrade and variety of items in meanu also needs to be extended overall great experience."
You like Punjab spicy food ?? This place is for you . Perfect family dinning place which provides with variety of starters and other Indian food. ( no continental food available) . Good infrastructure and peaceful zone
"It‚Äôs a very good place for family and really very good food with proper taste but the main and the most important is the service and it lacks for its service. The service is very poor, u cannot go with a big family. If they improve on this then it would be great. Otherwise everything else is good."
"Food is very good.. The best part is their humble service.. Whether on call or you are at the restaurant, their humble way of treating customers is something that makes them different from Others. Worth it.."
Been there on bhai dooj morning...we got the table immediately as we reached early...but there wasnt much space left post 1 pm. The food was great... Jalape√±o popper is yum...in the main course we ordered both chinese and punjabi both of which was good in taste but i felt quantity of sabji could have been better
"I been their on Diwali day with my family . It was well managed by manager. Staff was polite .Food was good .Value for money

They should start now Pasta and Sizzlers"
"A perfect place to dine with family, located at S.V rd, Kandivali west. This place serves North indian and Chinese.
Quality of food was pretty good Chinese as well as north indian
Ambiance here was decent.
Service was very slow, very much disappointed with the service part."
Not giving any benifits of ZOMATO GOLD while we dine...no doubt food if good but as a ZOMATO GOLD MEMBER it is INSULTING to here NO from ARK RESTAURANT management.
"Visited here with family in evening last Saturday, after reading positive comments on Zomato.

Ordered Veg Mohini & Paneer Tawa Mehefil based on suggestions of waiter along with butter roti & naan. The service was quick & the staff was polite. Both the subzi's were very very tasty & quite different in taste from normal punjabi subzi & also were well presented. The quantity was a bit less in comparison to the rates charged. But the awsome taste made up for prices. Also the repeat order was quick for roti's.

The ambience is very nice with soft music & live matches can be watched on big screen. Also ample of paid parking place available in complex. Overall had a good dining experience &...read more"
"Most pathetic restaurant ever visited the staff and the owner gives u too much attitude with pathetic service. Credit card machine not working and the owner demands that we remove cash from ATM and pay him there itself.
Had a pathetic experience here will definitely not visit this place ever again. The food is pathetic too.The staff seems disinterested in serving you food as well. They just wont give the table of ypur choice 2 families already were being shifted from one table to another. I would rather give the rating zero to this place.......dont waste your money here."
"Best place for vegetarians..

Pros
Polite staff
Fast service

Service is awesome
You can try veg platter
Nice ambience
Perfect fine dine restaurant

Area of improvement

Nothing much just food is bit costly but if you look at overall experience it's satisfactory."
"Ark veg is a decent place to have diner with family and friends.
This place has decent ambience.
Coming to food,
Had North Indian cuisine and it surely doesn‚Äôt disappoints. Presentation of the food is also good and taste was quite delicious.
Their food menu has variety of cuisines.
Staff service was moderate.
Would say overall it was a decent place"
Nice ambience and even better food. Do ask the staff there for special dishes and recommendations. Stuffed paneer roll and jalapeno poppers are treat to your taste buds. If you like mushroom then don't miss stuffed mushroom starter. Overall you will come back to this place to eventually try all the dishes. Wonderful experience
"Superb place.! Please ask Mr Kalpesh to make you a special main course and describe what taste you actually want.! They will Deliver you surely.!
Surely One of the best place for Indian main course...!!!"
"Pretty okay place, service was damn slow. Food quality was good. Taste was average (Paneer tawa Mehfil, Veg rangoli) Liked stuffed Paneer rolls. Good luck!"
Regular visitor at this place but today changed thaughts as writing this still waiting for starters after 25mins and that too hara bhara kabab ..and even not much crowded today..staff sucks only thing i herd is hamare hotel me idhar khana bante hai time lagega . not good ..
"Great Food,
Great Service,
Great Ambience.
Good variety of food and juices and mocktail.
Top family restaurant in the suburbs.
Must visitttt."
"A small place with very nice decor and courtagious staff. This place is in the premise of milap cinema. Awesome Punjabi and Chinese food. We have ordered Veg Masti, butter roti, garlic naan and butter kulcha. All the items were very good. Lastly we have ordered Veg pot rice and that was the best of the day dish. A must visit for kandivali gujjus !!"
"Ordered Veg Platter - total 3 different type of fingers n paneer starter in it! We had to leave it as it was extremely oily! After telling the manager he casually said Chinese food hence the oil
Not worth it!"
"My favourite fine dine. The food gets to your table a little late but its worth the wait. Have been to this place alot of times, tried various dishes,,none has ever disappointed me abit.! TOO GOOD."
"Nice,decent food
Service is better as compared to all the restaurants in the vicinity
One of the best restaurants in the locality‚ù§

"Best restaurant in western suburbs... only veg food is available. Many try starts its mouth watering...
All time busiest Resturant... whether it's weekday or weekend. Quality of fud is too good"

We tried:
1) Natkhat kebab
Rate - 3/5
2) Jalapeno Poppers
Rate - 5/5
I come here n do have my jalapeno poppers , it is soo cheesy and crispy."
"This would be the last place on Earth to visit second time at least for me and my family. It was my mother's birthday and we thought to celebrate it by having dinner in this so called restaurant. First of all the service was toooooo slow. Waiters were roaming around as deaf most of the time. The behavior of captain who was taking the order was unexpectedly so rude, awful and pathetic. We reached restaurant by 10.35pm the so called captain approached us and told us "" first and last order hai Jo order karna hai abhi kardo baad mein kuch nai milega"" it really felt like they are feeding to beggars. This restaurant closes by 11 so each and every time they were serving is the food...read more"
"One such place you would never want to visit because no one is interested in getting insulted or humiliated.
Very incoordinate staff, customer means trash to them.
Very average food and pretty disappointing treatment for a fine dine."
This is good place but services are very slow.. food is okay. Zomato pricelist attract us but Real Price is very different this is open cheating. so pls check before u go there..
"So we went to Ark Vegetarian Fine & Dine on a Sunday evening. The place was crawling with people. Here's what I have to say about the place.

Ambience: 4/5. The place looks classy. The interiors are well crafted. Although there were a couple of flies roaming on top of some of our heads but that can be taken care of by more cleanliness measures, I guess. Soft music played throughout & the lights were very well placed to create a cozy environment.

Food: 4.5/5. Food was pretty amazing. Everything was fresh & tasty. We relished the following dishes.
1) Veg Manchow Soup : All the spices were mixed well & it had all the elements of a Manchow soup.

2) Veg Rajwadi and Veg Maratha: We insisted...read more"

"Looking for anything close to a fine dine experience in/around MaKaBo!? (Malad - Kandivali - Borivali.... Yes, that's the abbreviation üòã)
Your search ends here...

Ambience:
There are quite a few udipi kinda restaurants around but none that comes close to nice cosy fine dine feel.
Ark gives you just that!

Yellow lights lit just enough to give you a warm feeling. Chandeliers and decor has a modern touch.

Service :
Staff is courteous and helps in suggesting their best sellers, of which most turn out to be good. Service is a little slow, so you need to go with a little patience and a lot of time! Especially if it's a weekend, you may have to wait even longer.

Food:

We had been to Ark on working day....but was amazed that there was a waiting time.....had been there with family....this place is amazing for vegetarian lovers......everything from Starters to Main Course was yumü§ó....recommend 1.Veg Masti. 2. Cheese Garlic Naan. 3.Jalapenos Poppers. 4. Broccoli and Corn Soup......they also play a background instrumental songs which adds spicy to your mood.
"I went here with my family on a Tuesday. We arrived early in the evening as we had 2 children in our group
Our orders were taken promptly but the starters took almost an hour to arrive. The main meal came out about 45 minutes later. The whole meal took about 3 hours. 

The shame of it was that the food is good.
Everyone enjoyed their meal, but it took far too long for it to come from the kitchen. They weren't particularly busy and we were amongst the first to arrive so I'm not sure why this happened.

If you want to linger over your food it's a nice night out but given how slow the service is i wouldn't take a family there."
Awesome food nice ambiance had to wait 30mins for my table but the food was worth the wait its was nice tasty fresh and they serve it with a smile
There are very few restaurants which serve quality vegetarian food in this vicinity. Ark is one of them. I love their Jain schezewan finger. Yes! They have Jain schezewan finger. Also Veg Mohini is an all time favourite.
Be it any paneer dish its superb.. Ambience is good.. No issues with the service as well.. The ones coming with vehicles there's ample of parking So chill up about it being at a crowdy place..
"One of the BEST RESTAURANT in Malad / Kandivali for north indian food.

Have visited Ark more than couple of times both during peak hours and odd hours. The service remains the same, ridiculously slow. Staffs attitude & attention needs to be improved.

Tip - Order all your soups, starters, main course together or well in advance."
"Today I was in a mood for Punjabi food. Ark Vegetarian was nearby, so I thought it would be the best place to dine.

A meal cannot be done without starters (for me), so we took Roasted Masala Khichiya Papad and Jalapeno Poppers.

Roasted Masala Khichiya Papad was a bit spicy, so I didn't eat much of it. Jalapeno Poppers is a must try. It was rolled in crushed papad. The taste was awesome. The tiny peices of jalapeno were also yummy.

A meal also cannot be done without main course (obviously). We took Paneer Butter Masala, (my favourite paneer ki sabzi) Naan, Butter Roti and Kulcha. The PBM's Paneer was soft and spongy as expected and the gravy was also creamy.

A restaurant can't be done...read more"
"Heard alot about this place since it was a complete pure veg restaurant. Visited this place on Saturday. Ambience was pretty good & simple. Staff was quick, courteous & friendly. We had ordered Tomato Basil Soup which was superb!! Had to ordered 2 times because the taste was too good. We ordered Hakka Noodles & Manchurian Gravy which was good. Will visit this place again & try other dishes."
"I am giving one star only for the ambience.. the food is not even average.. the first order was itself wrong.. we ordered Paneer Angeerey instead of which he got us Paneer Tikka.. initially the waiter was not ready to accept the mistake, then he did n told us he would get the right order, but even after waiting for 30 min he got us the same wrong dish!!! the waiter are not at all trained.. there was a guy Shridhar who was serving us the order who was extremely rude and unaware of what he was serving... very very bad experience!!!! Please don‚Äôt even try the place"

"Really hopeless service & food.
There is no difference price of butter roti & plain roti. In whole Mumbai there is only 1 restaurant who sale plain roti in price of butter roti. It is not Amazing."
"This place at PVR milap, is attractive for vegetarians and families.
They serve good food.
The service is upto the mark.
And the ambience is decent too."

ambience was nice.."
"A very good restaurant for family fine dine I specially liked Punjabi cusine, the ambience is superb but it is a bit costly and the food quality is also good"

Nice decor
We had visited for the 1st time
We had ordered punjabi,soup,masala pav
High ratedKarishma Adhia"
"Extremely slow service.
Never try for a weekend.
10min promised wait will surely be extended for 30min or more.
Food is good though a bit overly priced.
Considering the location there is better option such as landmark & Red Indians with equal or lesser rate and surely more quantity..
Restaurant badly needs to improve on hospitality."
"Food here is very yummy

Must try jalepeno poppers, stuffed paneer rolls, hara bhara paneer
Service- ??? Even i am poker face . Itni ‡§¨‡§ï‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏ hai ‡§™‡•Ç‡§õ‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§§

Here the wait for your turn is long.. 30 to 45 mins waiting on regular days.
No home delivery is provided"
"A family dining restaurant. Make sure you're okay with people chatting all around (not a place for people who love a quiet and peaceful environment while eating).

For starters, one can look for the Jalepeno poopers here. The kebab platter is an equally good option.

The main course, Mumtaz and Mohini should do the trick. Good texture and blend, should serve about 3-4 people easily.

If you're in for coolers you should probably go for the basics, pina colada or the virgin mojito. I wouldn't recommend any mocktails though, they don't decorate the drinks (which partly takes away the essence I'd say)."
"Amazing place to have meal. Ambience is nice. I loved the service. A waiter was allotted to stand in front of our table. We were very delighted to see that the staff was so keen to serve us with utmost sincerity. The dishes served here were truly amazing...Really loved the taste of every platter. Every dish had its special flavour. This made us feel that the chef cooked each and every dish very willingly and with a heart that wanted to serve the guests tasty dishes! We had ordered a couple of stuff like manchow soup (the all time favüòÇ), Broccoli corn soup, hara bhara kebab, veg laziz, cheese garlic kulcha(this was truly amazing), butter naan etc. Everything tasted very nice.

Nice food but not up to the mark and very oily request plz ask the waiter for oil less or less ull feel like u are eating in dhaba. interiors are ok.. hope if at all try to come second time gets good service and less oily food..
It‚Äôs a good family restaurant with amazing authentic north indian food and other continental cuisines. Good ambience. Good food at a good price. 8/10.
"I had heard about this place from a close friend, so went there yesterday to find.

Ark Vegetarian is a fine dine restaurant with a beautiful interiors and ambience is really good alongwith a soft music playing the background.

Food is different from what other restaurants have.
We had ordered the Kurkure Kebab which was soft from the inside and had a crispy coating on the outside. It was served with a spicy cabbage salad.

For the main course we ordered Stuffed Paneer Masala with Garlic Naan.

Service of the staff was very good.

In all , we had a good time and will be visiting Ark Vegetarian once again."
Got to here about this place from a friend. A fine dine restaurant serving delicious North Indian and the best Dum biryani I can say. After waiting for 40 mins we finally got place to sit worth for wait.
"Decent family restaurant for dine in, menu has good veg options

Can any guess what's rate of 1 phulka here Rs 60/- vs tandoori roti Rs 45 that the best part it was plain phulka not even butter one, plus gst of 5 percent

Thanks for serving phulka which is not in the menu but it has price in their computer surprisingly which is not disclosed until bill arrives at table

Manager was rude didn't help , owner was not available.

Overall not a good experience at all."
"A must visit for vegan lovers therefore don't be surprised if you see a long queue of people waiting to get a spot in there especially on weekends. Prompt service, awesome food especially the way they present and superb ambience is what you expect when you go out with family/friends and that is what exactly this people deliver. 
I have been here many times so I can definitely name few dishes which are must try and not forget quantity wise also it's good

Soup: Broccoli & Corn Soup , Manchow Soup
Starters: Kurkure kebab, Panner chilly dry, Panner Angarey
Main course: Veg Mohini, Veg Masti , Cheese Nan & Dum Biryani
Cocktail: Virgin mojito & cheese cherry pineapple

One of those restaurants where you'll have to end up taking the food for parcel and pass it on to some beggars. How can you mess up chaas too?
"'Dum Aloo Amritsari' at Ark is a must-order main course dish. It is spicy and has paneer mixed up with aloo with an authentic tandoor taste which is spicy as well. Reminds me of my days in Delhi where my aunt's neighbors took us for food trips and we had delights similar to this one here^ ‚ô®Ô∏è
I mean seriously, PUNJABIS ARE GONNA LOVE THIS."
Love this place.. Ambience hospitality .. Food is yummy. Perfect for a family lunch. Starters are innovative & yummy... Would love to visit again & again
"It's a newly opened finedine resto in suburbs. I rate it as follows:
Ambience- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Service -‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Food-‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Verdict -Recommended for North Indian food.
Must try - Handi Birayani."
"Experience a complete fine dine vegetarian restaurant.
With an amazing Ambience and spacious restaurant, this is the best place to have a complete satisfying meal.
The Starters have a very good quantity as well as the quality is too good. None of the items are common. All are unique and must try.
Recommendations- ‚Ä¢Veg Jalapenoes
‚Ä¢Crispy Stuff Paneer
The main course has all the items to suffice your *tastebulbs*.
Recommendation-
‚Ä¢Veg Masti
‚Ä¢Veg Maratha
‚Ä¢Paneer Jalfrazi
Go with your Family and friends to spend some good time!"
