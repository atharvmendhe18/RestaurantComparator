Review
"I am a regular here. The lunch buffet is amazing. Coca of ash chevre, raw papaya salad, baby potato, noodles, tofu and thai curry everything is perfect. Cherry on the top is hot chocolate dessert with icecream."
"If I would have to describe Amadeus Lounge in one word it would be, ""Fabulous"".

We were a group of 13, here to celebrate New Year's and it was just spectacular. The theme of the NYE party was Bohemian Rhapsody, and they had all the props in place for the guests.

The food was delicious. They had a vast buffet spread which primarily consisted of Indian and Italian cuisine. The appetizers were delish and the servers were warm and friendly, being prompt as well. Desserts are my favourite part of a meal, and they had an array to keep my sweet tooth satiated.

Amadeus is massive, with a great and sophisticated ambience. We sat outdoors as the weather was pleasant. Great crowd, and...read more"
"Good ambience but very disappointed with the service. Had to keep asking for our food - took a long time and the food wasn’t great either. The order was also very simple - garlic bread and fries, after being told that chat was unavailable !"
"Amazing place to dine !! This place has got a classy ambiance with professional staffs which help you to guide through the exact menu of your choice. We had been there for lunch, the place was not that crowded and hence was having a great time to dine !!
If you are going for lunch their buffet on table is a worth try 👍 They serve each and every dish on the table right from soups till deserts. Overall an interesting place to visit"
"We had a coca of Ash chevre
Pinchos of cottege cheese with harisa souce it was very nice😋😋😋
Friendly staff and service
Lovely ambiance
Thay had very nice experience
Thanks"
We love this place... this is our second time food was awesome and service is very fast specially Mr. SaNdEsH NAkTe...😘 we will definitely come back again....
"An amazing place for all sorts of events, be it a birthday, a private dinner, a wedding etc. Amadeus will never let you down in terms of its service and its ambience.

Amazing food and from the Izaya kitchens will blow your mind away and it ambience has got the whole world talking about. Amazing location for your events!"
Not at all advisable to go there for New Year’s Eve.... even though the food was ok... nothing great... the music and DJ were awful😐Not at all worth the price😱
"Am here for New Years Party and it is very very average . They seem to have got a very very bad DJ - maybe cheaper on Mumbai and hence bad music . Food is average .
Not a good way to spend 7500 for NYE"
"A proper night club to hang out with friends and family.
This place has got a very classy ambience with very professional service staff.
Located at the end of nariman point, this place has got everything you need to relax and have a good time.
Though its a bit heavy on pocket but its worth it.
This place serves oriental cuisine and their selection of alcohol is mind blowing.
Overall, a must visit place ."
"Very arty, beautiful interiors. It was a lovely experience. Simply amazing food. Service was fantastic. The ambience is great. I loved the location. Something unique."
"This place offers some finger licking food with really good ambience. Perfect place to catch up with friends or hang out after a show at NCPA.

We tried their Jacket Potato & Eggs Kejriwal (yes you read it right) with Bell Paper Chutney & Masala Fries and both were fabulous. The captain also made a custom drink for us with green apple and some spices which was cherry on the top.

The only downside was, we visited the place in monsoon & there were flies but the staff did their best to keep those away."
"For South Mumbai - Amadeus is a great dining option.
> It is quiet
> It always has place
> You can order the outside NCPA cafe Menu too inside the Restaraunt. Do ask for both the menus when you visit.

> Personal Picks :
- Chicken Turkish Pilaf
A kind of pulao which is exotic and very tasty

- Cocas
Pizzas which are semi circular but really tasty and light

- Peri Peri Chicken Main course
- Kathi Rolls

- Do not miss the Brocolli soup.

> Note : The NCPA cafe food is cheaper than the Amadeus one. Their presentation and service is always good.

> EXPERT TIP
- The Menu has a lot of fancy words but the dishes are very simple. So best is to call the chef and ask him to explain...read more"
Nice restaurant. Impeccable service. Good knowledge of Menu. Taste very authentic which led to few items little bland. Overall good experience.
"The outdoor seating was nice and the staff was attentive but it all stops at that.
For all the cuisines it claims to serve it pretty much boils down to a ghost of a dish form each cuisine, that too, overdone with so much of baseless creativity that the authenticity and taste are lost once it arrives at your table.
The food is pretty unimpressive with no well thought out end in mind.
The melon carpaccio with sour cream salad came in an ambiguous size that could neither be had with the tooth picks used to hold the slices or with a fork with the multiple stacking of the melons. The seasoning was inadequate between layers .... it was an amateurishly executed dish ...... not something worth...read more"
"Being the nearest to my office, I have been to this place several times now. The food is gorgeous, it looks good and tastes even better. Have tried almost all soups here- brocolli and almond is really good but white asparagus soup is the best among vegetarian. Few things to keep in mind- place is heavily priced, around 2k per person without drinks, the portion is enough for 2 people- however, if you ask the management guys over here they will say it is enough for one only. I like this place for a fine dine office lunch or dinner, formal setting."
"Mother's Day and we wanted an outing that stood the test of time . The resultant effort of searching for an ideal place ended.l at a beautiful place called Amadeus.

Amazing ambience and relaxed atmosphere made the gathering more eventful.

We opted for the Set Menu and found the spread quite satisfying.The portions were unlimited putting the onus on your capacity.Spread is limited but taste was excellent , so one can look to go AlaCarte too.

Staff were courteous helping us enjoy the lovely moments."
"It was mothers day. Love for mother is equal to Love for God and so we selected Amaedus.
Location and ambience: A very nicely located restaurant at NCPA. The tables were well laid out. The atmosphere was excellent.We had the Vegetarian Buffet.
Service: The service began very well . However after serving the first round of starters the waiters were never around. The food came in small quantities and the waiting for repeat was long. The waiters kept asking us if main course can be served even when the starters were not delivered. Seemed apparent that the delay was deliberate to ensure customers do not keep asking for starters. However they all miraculously appeared when we were ready to...read more"
The food as well as service was excellent.. Loved the ambience.. The servings too were in sufficient quantity.. Overall experience was value for money..
"Fine dining place... which lives up to value for money. Good service, in a long time I experienced worth a service without demanding. Excellent paella. Turkey bacon wrapped prawns as starters were too good. Good food and good service. Surely in my list of suggestions for fine places."
Dinner last night was a very pleasant experience at Amadeus. For starters we had the sea bass squares which were frankly quite ordinary. After that you could never look back as their next two starters were delicious. Their chicken pinchos and the turkey wrapped prawns were heavenly. Main course was kid lamb and this is probably the most tender meat that I have had anywhere. I have never tried better. Absolutely amazing. Dessert was the chocolate cigar and their filo mille. Both of these are their signature desserts. The ambience and service was excellent. The only problem is that whenever you go there is that the restaurant is invariably empty. I have never been able to explain that with...read more
"Some places can steal your heart and this is one of them! The ambience, food, service will just make your experience a pampered one..have visited this place twice and had no regrets to keep going back..food is well presented and its just superb..it is an expensive place but totally worth it. Highly recommended for dinner with family or a romantic date."
"Food was excellent . service was too the mark. had a wonderful time. looking forward to visit again.
keep up the good job . prefect place for celebration ."
"So, my first time at Amadeus heard and read great reviews. Since Iranian cuisine was on the menu I ordered the Zereshk Polo it seemed more like a Biryani and full of chillies. I did make it very clear that I wanted food without chillies, however Zereshk Polo being an Iranian dish by default is non-spicy. Unfortunately you don't expect Amadeus to serve you Biryani type Zereshk Polo. I think the restaurant needs to re-check how its made or the next time I do visit Amadeus which is unlikely, I will give them authentic Iranian Zereshk Polo. There are authetic Iranian restaurants in Bombay that serve way better Zereshk. The money for the dish was refunded which doesn't really matter as the...read more"
"visited this place for the new years bash with a group of friends ... food , alchohol, ambience, music and decor was smashing :-) ... the group loved it

My recommendations / Observations include
1. Car Parking available in road ... though can get crowded during peak hours or weekends
2. Book in advance as place gets sold out
3. Food is really good and tasty .. service is fast and courteous and overall a excellent eating place
4. they had organised a great DJ and music was flowing and crowd was rocking the dance floor .. we left at 3 in the morning and the place was still flowing :-)

"Visited for office closing lunch, ambience is good, food is also very good....4.5/5 for food,
Staff 2.5/5
Ambience 4/5
Location 5/5
Will definitely visit again!"
"Overall it was a good experience. The staff is courteous and suggests good options. We had some berry Sangria which was quite delicious. For starters we ordered Arancini with water chestnuts & asparagus was nice but tad oily and bland for my liking. Next we had Veg Pilaf with zucchini broccoli and peppers. It was fresh and delicious would def recommend it for veg option.Cocas with mushrooms, brie & pine nuts was another dish we ordered which is basically square thin crust pizza was yummy. Overall a good experience

Visited December 2016"
"Have been visiting for a few years now and have never been let done by the food, service or ambience. Probably my favorite restaurant in Bombay."
"Perfectly cosy ambience, courteous staff, great food and a place for conversations. They also have an outdoor option if you are feeling like it"
"Disappointment, Disgraceful, Terrible, Waste of time.

cannot define this place any better. Went there for buffet today afternoon, worst ever had in my life time. Feeling was to just throw the plate and leave. I mean waited for an around 30 mins for a thin slice of a pizza (really sad one), some stinking stale fish and honestly don't even remember the other one.
Soup was served in shot glass, I mean really a shot glass !!!! who serves soup in that. I really don't wanna talk about the main. It was pathetic.
Rating for Service : would be minus 100
Rating for Quality : the place doesn't know watt quality means


My advice to everyone If u plan on eating here make sure u carry a sandwich...read more"
Vegetarian delight with a twistt- starter- burnt garlic spinach brie..feta tzatiki relish and cocas (like a pizza) ash Chevere with jalapeño and caramelised onions. Main course- paella vegetariana..quality as it is as had been almost 5yrs back..just opened time..always a treat to the taste buds
The ambience is very good. The food is excellent. Great options for Dessert. Service could be better. Mosquito can be a bit of bother. Useful to be prepared with a repellant.
"Perfect. Place for a hangout with friends with the long bar that they have and the various corners that they have specially made so the you can hang out with small groups of friends and have a super time in your gangs!
The finger food is definitely great to eat and would recommend to try and taste the Pan Asian starters with the various mocktails!!
Try the tall LIIT here!"
"The restaurant is located in the most prominent area of Mumbai within the premises of NCPA theatre. The ambience is cozy and exudes warmth. As far as food ic concerened, the edamum and truffle oil dimsum was awesome. The achari paneer tikka with accompanying salads was succulent. The Jacket potetoes with sour cream & beans and the oriental main courses were just about ok and nothing much to rave about..."
"Delicious food. Subtle flavors, and portions are good. The cream berry dessert was classy. Suits well for a special occasion. Reservation service was also very customer friendly, with automated messages."
"Have been here its amazing, few queries if you can reply which we dint asked when we were there.

What are the best options for my Jain friends, because I am planning to bring them next time."
"Good restaurant with lots of varieties in their menu, ambiance is nice. we have ordered chicken khao suey which was great, Paneer Jalapeno was decent and Garlic Scented chicken fondue which was a disaster, it wasn't up to the mark and taste was weird we have asked it to cancel but they have tried different things but still it wasn't eatable. We have also ordered egg, chicken fried rice and 7 pepper chicken that was good.

Place is really nice but that Fondue has given us bad experience otherwise it's a must try."
"I just totally love this place. The ambience , the feel of luxury dining and the food too so good .. This is my third visit to this place . Absolutely love this place , it's so calm and peaceful , perfect for a meal .. This time I was with my family after watching a show at NCPA on Sunday.. It wasn't crowded could get a table easily at around 8:30 pm .. 
Great place 
cheers!"

"We really enjoyed our evening at Amadeus. The food was good, as was the service and the ambience. I'd definitely go back! The tapas were enjoyable as were the mains ( portions are quite big tho ). Nice place for a date and / or an evening with friends / family."
Amadeus has one of the best barbeque chicken with Thai basil and the best potato starters. Khausey out here is perfect with its think curry and the coconut flavour. Their assorted breads melt in ur mouth and our delicious in taste. Must try for a light quite lunch..!
"I tried around 5-6 dishes here and each one left me spellbound. Ambience is perfect, music is soft and soothing. Service is quick. They have a variety in terms of what one can eat and each one is quite different in itself. Here is what you see and recall ' cooking is an art' , such a finesse!
Try Mushroom cigar, stuffed cheese mushrooms, Chilly fried Sweet potato dish and also Mini Chocolate Cigar. They also have this cucumber dish that i can't recall but delicious and while writing i am still craving for them. Must go place with you family."
"One of bona-fide fine dine places in Mumbai which make one want to dress nice and behave nice the moment one walks in, something not a lot of places inspire us to do! Good old fashioned hospitality with not a false note whether it be the ambiance, service or selection of menu. This is one place to come for all those special occasions we want to be memorable. Needless to say, it all comes at a price, so be prepared.

My sister and I had a tapas menu with some dishes I have no idea how to pronounce :D But it all tasted good. so I have no problems in recommending them. Love the authentic European and Mediterranean taste of everything they serve here, we especially loved the pizza (Ash Chevre...read more"
"Great food! Periperi chicken, cocas with mushrooms and brie was very tasty. The tofu with barley risotto was yummy too! Prompt service. Staff very polite."
"Real good cocktails.. A wide variety of them too... Food also is top class.. We ordered the turkish platter which was well done... The spareribs were soft succulent and tasty.
The staff was extremely helpful in recommending their specials...
All in all a wonderful evening spent with friends..."
"Amazing food. Interesting concept. Lovely wine. Try the ""my sweetest mistake""."
"The tapas and cocos were excellent the quantities are decent and was all vegetarian... And the mains were nice
But most important .. Service was superb"
A play at NCPA and dinner at Amadeus.. What else do you need to have a relaxing weekend?! Spanish tortilla and lobsters made me realise what 'quality food' actually is! The chocolate cigar and mango desert served beautifully in a glass couldn't be resisted even for a minute!
"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, perhaps the greatest and the most celebrated composer that has ever graced the Earth, and since I dig Classical music, I just had to be here! Even the location makes sense, the NCPA at Nariman Point, which has been at the forefront of the arts in the city.

So, they had their flying buffet event going, I was lucky enough to catch it before it ends on 30th June. The buffet didn't boast a spread that would impress many. And, the vegetarian items aren't offered to you if you go for the non vegetarian buffet, blasphemy. Who does that?

"Sauve and classy is what comes to your mind when you enter this place. This eating joint is inside NCPA and consists of Amadeus Cafe and Amadeus Restaurant. Today I am going to review about Amadeus Café.
Amadeus Café has a fresh feel to it with nature as it's theme. The café is full of green plants and wood work along with plush cane chair and cane tables to complete the look. The best thing I liked about the place was they sprinkle minutely tiny droplets of water mixed with natural scents to provide a cooling effect and it feels fresh sitting there with nobody else's food smell coming to you.
Moving on to the food:

One Sunday afternoon my friend and I decided to walk into this place. We were greeted very well to nice rich ambience. They got us seated on a nice table handed over the menu. Different cuisine and different food. My friend was a vegetarian so he went about ordering a nice salad. I wanted to be safe and ordered the pink sauce pasta. ( I judge Italian restaurants with the pasta). We waited for about 25 mins and the food was served. I was very hungry by the time the food arrived and I polished my meal in about 15 Mins. Decent portions. My friends salad also was very good I don't remember which one though just know that it wasn't the usual Caesar salad. All in all a good experience. This...read more
"Fine Dining. A term that does not only denote food of highest standards but perfect ambiance, top-notch service and the old world charm that instantly makes us nostalgic. Amadeus is a must-visit for revisiting and relishing the true meaning of Fine Dine.

Situated inside NCPA (Gate 2) which is among Mumbai's premier places for promotion of Arts whether it be movies, painting, singing, play performances or orchestra, Amadeus is an award-winning European restaurant specializing in Spanish, Greek, Turkish, Arabian cuisines. The menu is not unnecessarily bloated and only the best is served by the most impeccably polite and efficient staff who take care of every patron who walks in the door...read more"
Went to Amadeus with my mother. The manager there really went out of his way to provide things which she could have. he place is just amazingThe courtesy and professional perfectness is blended to perfection just like the food they the Brocoli and almond soup as well as the chicken cream soup were very good. Even simple home made vanilla bean ice-cream is out of this world .
"Hmmmmm where to start, it bit confusing. Service, food or location. It's like everything is best. Went with couple of my friends we all tried different things like coffee, mock tail and drinks. My favourite - Hawaiian Hula, Experience of drinking white Malibu and Gin with coconut water. Just can't explain, too good. No idea about non veg dishes, but veg khow suey was out of this world. A must try place"
"My review is more about the lack of scrupulousness of the valets employed by the restaurant. 

We had a play to watch at NCPA and the valets came running as if the NCPA offers valet parking. They charged us Rs. 100 for parking. Later, on seeing the paper that was shared, we found that it bore the name of this restaurant and was 'gratis'. 

So, valets for this supposedly upscale restaurant are taking people for a ride. Mostly, such things happen when the restaurant management allows it to happen with a wink. Maybe they do not need to pay the valets enough as there is a flow of side income. But would you like to go to a restaurant with such pathetic management?

"Amadeus roughly translates to 'Love of God', and this restaurant tries to bring this love to us through food. Coming from the same management as Joss, Umame and Café At The NCPA, Amadeus tries to provide some really posh food. However on this path to become an elite place, it seems to have lost itself. Because after all the insignificant regality, the tried and tested food, and its incredulous price tag, you still don't seem to leave this place too content. Why? I reiterate, Amadeus has strayed from its path.

Service: It started off well, but after a while it become intrusive and an unpleasant presence. We had to deal with 3 different workers to get to our reserved table, then a waiter...read more"
"You know that you’re in for a musical treat when you enter a place named Amadeus. For those who aren’t in the know, Amadeus has in all likelihood been named after the prolific classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Rightfully, this resto-lounge is largely oriented to the arts. Any music lover will appreciate the larger-than-life, black and white framed pictures of music icons such as Zakir Hussain, Zubin Metha and the likes. Besides, the resto-lounge is attached to Mumbai’s renowned National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), making it a must-visit for patrons and performing artists.

Went with a few of my friends the ambience is good service is friendly and good had a the Turkish platter and Cocas for starters both well done for main course had kaffir scented breast of chicken which was very good and Turkish Pilaf that was a let down the mocktails very good overall experience was nice would recommend this place
Just the other day I came across a post on fb saying they had a limited stock of Wagyu this got me very interested as I have just returned from Japan. How would this taste would it live up to its name would it taste the same as I had in Japan how much will it cost these thoughts were running though my brain and I had to just go and try it out for my self. I did go yesterday the price made my heart miss a beat but then I thought to my self when we travel we pay an arm and a leg without flinching why can't I do it here.

"Went to Amadeus after a dance concert at the NCPA. This is a fine dining restaurant inside the NCPA. It has a very interesting menu and the ambience is very classy. The lighting is just right and creates that romantic allure.

My friend ordered the pizza and she was very happy with it. Her face lit up when she was biting into the cheese. I ordered the Paella Valenciana which I felt could be much better. When I go back I would choose something else - not the Paella. Thankfully the menu provides lots of interesting options to choose from.

Rated highly for the ambience for now."
"Lovely place. Good food. Went there with family so kids and oldies, had ordered everything from their very famous pizzas to risotto. Very nice food and service."
"After booking a play at NCPA we searched for near about restaurant and found this place over Zomato Reviewer and reserved a table. After reaching there it was great to see lakme fashion show event was going on. We ordered Pankho dusted mushrooms with caramelized onion and jalapenos; coca of spicy chorizo with Apple cider caramelized onion; and two other dish I forgot the name. Food was good and we all had our personal favorite. Liked everything that was served. Quantum I felt was a bit less as compared to peer restaurant, but, everything is good that tastes good! To top it all the dessert came to our surprise, it was the epitome of creativity, beautiful presentation and taste. The best...read more"
"Very international style of recipes and presented in their original form without 'Indianisation' of taste. Excellent choice of Arabic and Mediterranean food. For the quality and taste as well as the top of line ambience pretty much 'value for money'. However individually it's is an expensive and fine dining place. A better variety of wines would have added to the 'style quotient' of the place.

Private parties which run in the adjoining hall can be a pain with loud music et al."
"We went to this place after hearing a lot about its Spanish paella.

For starters we ordered a chicken starter which tasted yummm unfortunately don't remember the name :p

We ordered paella Valencia for the main course. It had prawns,chicken, mussels and fresh fish catch. The prawns and the fish were very fresh and the portion size is good as well.

The sauce in which it was cooked was simply amazing. Must have dish when you visit amadues."
"Located at the NCPA, this place is highly recommended for all the food lovers. Though the place is highly priced but atleast one try is a must. Sophisticated place with authentic food."
"Amazing ambience, the taste is very fine, loved the presentation, the staff is warm and friendly. This exactly what I expected from Amadeus."
"A really beautifully constructed place. Its next to NCPA cafe. The ambiance was pretty good, the staff were really courteous and they knew what they were doing and how they were serving!

One of the best places I've had spanish food at, really authentic. They have a huge variety of Tapas for non vegetarians and an option of a vegetarian tapas too where different dishes are cooked on different base. A must check out, totally value for the money."
"What the season of summer demands is a cool refreshing salad to calm your nerves down. Watermelon feta salad is a simple dish but with such zing that I couldn't stop admiring the presentation and the blend of the mild flavors fighting for attention on the palate. A must try.
Lamb roast is another exquisite preparation but I couldn't enjoy it completely at this fancy place because honestly, what fun is meat unless you can hold it in your hands and lick upto the bone. Nevertheless, I did lick off the gravy with bread.
Service is really good."
"Should have done this earlier but nevertheless
Had a very lovely experience dining & entertaining guests there
The food & the service exceeded our expectations
We were in the private dining area for a celebration & we thoroughly enjoyed our lovely meal there with lots of privacy
Jain food was also served impeccably well alongwith the regular food
Loved the sushi the coccas

Always love the khowsuey ,.the cigars
But the surprise package was the chole kulcha which was yum !
Thks to the very well trained & helpful staff we had a wonderful party!"
This place is perfect for a date. The ambiance is amazing. The food is great . We had pankho mushrooms for starters and they came topped with amazing goat cheese fondant. The spaghetti mar de gras was perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce. But my favorite was the oversized tostadas . My only complaint is that the food took too long to come.
"Perfect romantic ambience
Fantastic menu! Must try Turkish kebab platter, wood grilled salmon and the best seafood paella!
Prices are very reasonable compared to the amazing quality.
The quantity is also really good.
Very courteous staff.
Perfect date night spot! Very satisfied overall.."
"Place is a rip off but taste will linger until you go there again and still find the food insatiable :) exclusively for Italian lovers ;) wow is the word !!!!
Drinks are same as what you would buy at theka, so I'll call it over priced but who cares when the food and ambience has made your day :)"
Very Nice place but was a little chaotic on a Saturday night (not good for a Fine Dine). Good food albeit a little overpriced. Must say excellent and courteous service. Nice place for a cozy Dinner.
"Amazing ambience, beautiful location.. Go there if you want to have a good Spanish food. I ordered chicken and shrimp dimsum which was absolutely mouth watering. Chicken pinchos and Turkish chicken pilaf was above average. Tiramisu is a must try. Would recommend to read about Spanish food before going there so that you know what to order. Definitely a must-try place...though I had more expectations..."
"Its one of those restaurants where everything is good...the ambience,service and the food! The cottage cheese skewers alongwith the dip is highly recommended. The enchiladas and the waterchestnut entree were also appealing! For the desserts we called for the chocolate cigars and the mille feuile-both absolutely outstanding. Overall a good culinary experience!"
Its a beautiful fine dine restaurant located in NCPA. Great ambiance with an eager staff. The manager makes it a point to meet first time visitors. Huge variety of dishes available and the service is quick too as it hardly took 10-15 mins to get served. The food quality is excellent. The food portion however is slightly disappointing. We had the chicken piri piri which is just enough for 2. Overall a great place to have lunch on a quiet Sunday.
"I quite enjoyed myself here - mostly coz I didn't pay. =D

The ambiance is spectacular. The service is excellent. The food is beyond compare. What's not to like? This is one of the few places where the food was so good that I forgot to take photos.

We had a salad, some interesting tapas, their mushroom coca (which is basically a pizza) and for mains we had the stuffed crepes and paella. The most memorable were the crepes and the coca. The dessert was a droooooolicious chocolate soufflé. And some strawberry ice cream thing. Drooooool!"
"A must try place!! BEST SPANISH FOOD EVER HAD!! Starting with their soup to the salad, Crawling down to the starters, main course and the deserts , Everything was A-1.Their food can actually enlighten ur mood.The Hazlenut Chocolate tart should by no means be left behind in ordering.Service throughout the meal was superb.The bill seemed to me very fair given the tremendous amount of work that had gone into the dishes, and the excellent ingredients used. Overall this was an impressive meal."
"Probably the only place for Spanish food...
It's nice, the food is sophisticated, the ambience is spot on.

Definitely a must try if you like cuisine"
"Heard a lot about the restaurant and its food. However came back being mildly disappointed . The starters were excellent , nothing to complain. Great fresh meat and balanced flavours. I was looking forward to the main course but the biryani was below average . So dry, and lacked flavour. Just felt like rice with some meat. The main courses definately need some sprucing up."
"Have visited this place quite a few times but was genuinely impressed only the first time around.
The last visit was disappointing as service was very slow inspite of the place being quite empty.
Ordered for some tapas- strictly ok! The spinach and cheese rolls were delicious.
Our mocktails were decently made. The let down was the main course. We had a plastic piece in our pasta but the manager was courteous enough to apologise profusely and replace the dish and also gave us a complimentary dessert.
Overall an OK experience. May/ may not visit again!"
Great food... Great ambience.... Great starters super crepes... One can have a great quite time with ur loved ones..... Located right at the edge of Mumbai's nariman point the feeling is awesome...
