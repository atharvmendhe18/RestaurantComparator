The modal was very salty and tasteless
The tea was only boiled in sugar water and added tea leaves. despite mentioning no sugar. Floating oil in the misal. Sabhudana & poha was ok

"Quality was lil poor,sabudana not well cooked. Surely not worth Rs.90/-"

"Got a cockroach in dahi
And they are selling it for vrat"
Restaurant sent incomplete order. Loni not given!
Delivery got delayed as Amey took above 40 minutes to prepare food. Amey was unresponsive on phone as well.
The food is no doubt good. But today I was disappointed with their delivery. The order which was supposed to be delivered at 1.....i instead received a call at 1 stating they have 1 curry out of stock. Post concluding the call with an affirmation that the order will be dispatched shortly...my order was cancelled at 1.37 without any call or message. My family suffered their lunch time. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL
Too much oil
"The chutney with kothimbir vadi was spoilt, the sabudana khichdi was not delivered instead got sheera which also smells spoiled. terrible food"
No veggiee in the misal full of only oil

Firstly the order took 1hr to get delivered and after waiting for an hour we got a badly packaged and full of oil misal and only misal.no pav was sent with the order. and I don't understand how can you deliver food in a plastic carry bag ...pathetic food and pathetic delivery and packaging
Totally disappointed with Thalipheeth... appeared fried... too much oil... Modaks and Kothimbir Vadi were okay but could have been much better...

I had ordered sabudana wada and upwas Patice they did not give chutny or curd to dip I was very disappointed with their service
"taste was excellent, quantity is enough for 2 people, however price is bit high, better you order 1 plate and 2 extra pav."
modak is of poor quality.not worth the price at all. its made of maida and stuffing is also very dry.the outer covering was so rubbery like and not chewable at all.never buy ukdiche modak from here.i buyed 24 modak so that I can show 21 modak vevad and its horrible taste and overrated.i strictly recommend do not buy modak from here.
""
all time favorite restaurant... food quality always good.

"It appears that they are serving silver as the quantity is so less for its price, it‚Äôs a sip of Basundi for Rs. 130."
"portion size has gone down
also sabudana khichdi was all stuck up together"
very less quantity and charged double ...i am very disappointed
"I ordered modak (pack of 6) x 3. Instead of 18 modak, I received only 3 in a single box but was charged full payment. When I called Amey, the person was extremely rude. Firstly, he said Amey doesn't deliver at my location and that I should send someone to collect it. I had to spend an additional delivery charge to have my items delivered to me. When I expressed this to Amey, his absolute rude response was - ""main counter pe baitha hoon, I don't know what happens inside the restaurant. insaan hoon, insaan se galti hota hai, main 3 box ke 3 baar sorry bola na."" He then proceeded to cut my call and didn't answer thereafter.
Amey, this is not the way you treat your customers. I...read more"
Order was wrong - I got boy Usal n taste was very poot
"In being hospitality business there is no hospitality there I would say. This place was recommended by someone I know. They told me that the place is fantastic for veg food so I thought why not give it a try. The menu have ample number to choose from in each category. The food is average I would say not that too die for. Sitting is ok. There is no as such ambiance of the place. The food which was delivered to me was cold and when I complained about that they started fighting that this can never happen and were not ready to accept there mistake
I won't recommend this place because of there hospitality and there service is also very slow. You will get many good places in Mumbai to eat."
