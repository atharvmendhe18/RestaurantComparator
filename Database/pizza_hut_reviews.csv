"I had ordered today for a Pizza, it was a one plus one offer. Had a very bad experience, my order came at 12 in the night. The quality of Pizza was pathetic to the core. Had to literally skip my food today. They should not keep such offers which they might not be able to fulfil. It was complete waste of money.."
Their signature range paneer tandoori pizza is worse than the over loaded big pizza in spite of being double in cost... Ordered home the first time from here and realized there are other better options at much lesser cost in the vicinity... The taste is pathetic and there is a good chance you may end up with an upset stomach the next day :(
"Worst center of pizza hut. First of all their telephone is always busy. Then after 15 calls when they finally pick our call and take our order, then the game of waiting begins and then we dont ever get the order on time and when we claim that we must get rhis order for free then they start saying that no today this offer is not valid. Very very disappointing from pizza hut. Dominos is much better than pizza hut, yes they dont offer that much deals of offers but at least they give your pizza and dont back off from their 30min or free offer!
Pizza hut airoli is worst and no one should order a pizza their.
In fact i would recommend a video on you tube against pizza hut airoli.

"Although Pizza Hut is a very popular pizza chain I have never given it a try. So during the four-day holiday for Holi, Good Friday, Sat and Sun, checked their menu and decided to try pizza and pasta. The bases of the pizzas were good, but the amount of cheese, chicken and other toppings were quite less. Pizza Hut needs to use their Cheese, Chicken and toppings more generously than they do now. Tastes of the pizzas were good but what disappointed me was the Cheesy pepper non-veg pasta. It was tasteless and there was no taste of pepper as the name claims. There was no cheese either and the chicken lost it taste as lots of soyabeans or other substitutes were used (may be to increase volume)....read more"
"Pathetic service ever by any pizza joint..it was almost 1 hr 45 mins , i had ordered for pizza..still there was no sign of delivery...so called up the joint then he said order will be delivered in next 10 mins..but sadly pizza was never delivered...Seriously guys, shut the store if u dont value customers time...n pls dont any offers if u cannot manage the orders..."
"Not a grt place . its just OK as it is near the place I live had been here. Service is not so grt but the taste yea its kinda on the gud side.
Looking at the service ,place and taste I could just rate this 3 not any more"
"......Good pizza ......nice service..,.............@.. pizza delivered hot and on time ... enjoyed the garlic bread and yummy pizza.........."
Service is no fun. But the pizzas were fine. If you are fan of PH then call & get it delivered & avoid a visit. Its unlike the other PHuts where you find fun.
"One of the worst Pizza Hut outlets I have visited. The service is slow and staff is non-cooperative. The service is slow and we have to wait for a long time for even a small order.
The EDC machine was not working and I suggest you to carry cash with you whenever you think to try this outlet. 
Butsometimes you dont have option as there are not many places to have pizzas in Airoli  :("
"The PHD version of pizza hut barely gives me any reason to step in. Saw their recent advertisements for low rate range and wanted to give it a try so hopped in.

Ambiance is good. Bright, spacious tables, clean. Service is fine. 

Coming over to the new menu.
Loaded miniz Veg: Palm sized thick bread with hardly any ketchup and cheese. Capsicum tasted well. Why the hell have they put in chole??? Big thumbs down!
Cheezy Garlic Bites: Garlic bread cut into cubes, topped with mayo and some other delicious sauce. Superb taste. Highly Recommended.

I have not had pizzas from this outlet of pizza hut. Not a big fan of their pizzas. The starters and mocktails are the only reason I would...read more"
The best pizza crust u can ever njoy i lov pizzahut dey need to improve. On garlic bread rest all gud n yummmmm............ ................
"A generic pizza restaurant. Good quality of service, fast and efficient. However, the food was bland, the pizza bread didn't meet the usual requirements and there was nothing in the food that jumped out as wow. Not recommended for people with a taste for savory food however cheese lovers may like it. The plus point was the pasta is often well made here."
I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. . It wasn't crowded. Food was served quickly... music system was not functioning properly. Ketchup was kept in a really greasy plastic can.. I suggest d management to serve ketchup in sachets..
Went with a friend. Ordered a pizza margherita and pasta. The pizza was cheesy and fresh.My friend ordered a pasta and she found that to be satisfactory.
"My friend ordered some chicken supreme (so cheesy) and a veg supreme (so cheezy) pizza and 1 standard garlic bread and 1 that had chillies. I am not a pizza hut fan and hence unaware of their menu but my friend is a fan so I went for it. Firstly the website borrowed Domino's famous line ""30mins or free"" and tadaa.. Order was late by a good 15mins. We called their helpline and were promised that we would be receiving a call from the store manager within 10mins which we didn't. Then came the delivery guy, shabbily dressed, without the bill. When we questioned why was he late he had no answers. We asked him to call his store manager and he didn't have the number. We again called...read more"
"So, yeah my urge was started at my office when they pinged me about 1 on 1 offer and decide to have pizza in pizza hut, as it is my all time favourite pizza eating place. Here is a list:-

Pros:-
1.The location is just opposite to Dominos ,so if you don't like pizza hut's pizza you can cross the road and dominos is available for serving. :p :D

Cons:-
1.Pizza hut is known for its interior looks too, but here it feels like you are sitting and eating pizza inside your office chamber or desk.
2.Be ready to face the heat inside coz their AC could not work.
3.Poor way of customer interaction.(I asked for a glass of water, the waiter looked at me as if i asked him to give his salary).
4.Poor...read more"
"One of the very worst pizza I ever had..the very worst Pizza Hut outlet..
Very limited menu..
Toppings r so much less..
Ones I ordered the chicken was smelling like pork..as if they have stored it with pork meat for so long in their friedge..
Lets come to garlic bread now..Garlic bread spicy supreme is very famous dish of pizza hut but here they made me wrong..its so much oily n even breads r also not fresh n even they bake it so much that it becomes black only..
I would say that if u r truly a pizza lover n planning to order from pizza hut airoli outlet please think twice..
I dont understand y they put those garlic bread in chole?
Big thumbs down for that..
I m big fan of pizzas of pizza...read more"
"Worst pizza hut i have ever been to.
I had ordered a regular capsicum pizza.
After waiting for almost 40 minutes right there at the place we got the pizza.
All it had was 4 capsicum pieces that too gross looking, one on each of the 4 pieces.
And the bread quality sucked too.
I would never go to that wretched place ever again and would suggest not to go there.

P.S. - I wanted to give it a 0.1 rating but the least is 1.0"
"Pizza hut has usually been a positive experience. However, the Airoli outlet manages to be an exception. For beverages they only had soft drinks. They served cheese garlic bread and pasta in takeaway boxes. Cheese garlic bread was good. Pasta was just about okay. The outlet is small. Ground floor was full. We were told that tables are available upstairs. When we went there. .there was No place to sit. Came back to gr floor and one table was vacant. We had to ask them to clean the table. They were serving us on a dirty table otherwise. Very disappointed. Airoli outlet is affecting the reputation of pizza hut. Not recommended unless you are opting for home delivery or takeaway."
"Worst experience , After having pizza from here I had to suffer the whole day vomiting. Don ever go to Pizza hut. Just ignore this place. The delivery boy showed so much attitude in giving proper change"
One of those places where good hospitality is missing. Waiting time is very long. Domino's is a better choice. The counter staff had forgotten that they had to have a smile while interacting with customers. Being curt is not the mantra.
After 4 years had pizza and I loved it .... Rawalpindi Chana paneer pizza is awesome .... My boyfriend loved it .... Keep it up guys .......with Nitin agarwal
"Never on time!!!! I have scheduled order of 1:30pm, and not recived even at 2'o clock..still waiting...

not able to give 0 on zomato..they should be given -5 if possible"
"As it is cleared by my rating, my experience is nothing different from Shruti and Shivam (First 2 reviewers).
Pathetic services. I doubt , if Airoli Pizza hut is really a franchisee of actual Pizza hut. 
We had ordered both veg and non-veg pizzas, but there is no segregation marked by them to identify veg or non-veg. It is too difficult for us to identify veg or non-veg. Test is also worst, topping is too old and smelling. Overall very bed experience. I won't prefer airoli pizza hut now. Worst experience of pizza hut."
"If only there was an option to rate below 1 , Id have done that too...Really sad that pizza hut service would be so pathetic.Our drink order was changed by them from Miranda to 7up without any consult with us.  
We had ordered both veg and Non veg pizza's. There was a weird taste to the bread like that you get when stale oil is used to cook. It was so overpowering we had to almost throw half the bread. The toppings were mostly concentrated in the crust , and there was a large part of topping less crust smelling of the old oil.:(
The famous Pizza hut garlic bread was also ok..nothing great about it. 
Moreover, even after requesting minimum 3-4 times while ordering to send a swipe machine...read more"
"Pizza Hut should check there chains are working properly or not.
I was the fan of the Pizza Hut pizza, but got disappointed when I preferred to visit local pizza outlet instead of Mulund Pizza Hut .

People are not attentive . It seems that you are the one in need of food and not they .
Masala lemonade one of the franchise trademark of PH is not avail. In soft drink only limited options (Mirinda and 7 up) who the hell drinks that with pizza.... ????????

Pizza arrived on time .. But with over-baked but they served it without care.
For sure I won't going to that outlet again."
