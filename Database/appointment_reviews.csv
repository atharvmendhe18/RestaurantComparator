Chinese is tasting like a pav Bhaji
The dosa was too sour and tasteless! Idli was decent while the medu vada was too oily. And the coffee was horrible to say the least. Too add to this the water served had particles floating in it!! Absolutely disgusting and unhygienic. The sambar was quite nice. I would recommend ordering a steamed idli and sambar. But definitely not visiting again

Vegetables were raw and pulav had bitter taste

Wrong parcel
The chili paneer was nothing like it used to be. Itâ€™s a wet item instead of a dry one.
horrible taste....the taste has detoriated after the main guy has passed away...they are now just there to make money... tasteless and classless
I had ordered paneer Kolhapuri but I got some other vegetable which was quite sweet.

ok
"excellent bhel, quality and quantity"

Biryani was too dry and paneer quality was not that good.
Veg crispy had no vegetables. There was only batter mixed with onion. I have eaten it before from the same place but this time it was a horrible experience
"no taste in food, sambhar and chutney were watery as if someone had added water for increasing portion size."

Disaster will never order stale and thick portions with uncooked sides
Too much colour was added
""
for a simple Idli delivery took too long.
Zero taste

Delivery reached too late. It was a wrong decision as restaurant is nearby but food came too late.
food arrived late & zomato charged more than the restaurant charged for spring rolls.
