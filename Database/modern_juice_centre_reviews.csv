"One of the best veg cheese burger i ever had. The corn, peas and potato patty with cheese and mayo tastes really good. The light spiciness and pickled cucumber and tasty chicken wrapped in malabari paratha tastes delicious."

"Chicken Shawarma in Khuboos

Chicken Cheese Burger

Both were overloaded in mayonnaise and felt extremely greasy. More than necessary quantity used.

Chicken felt frozen and not fresh.

Threw half the burger and had an upset stomach the following day.

I have been eating from here but this time the food was horrible."

"Ordered for an open shwarma and baida roti.
-Shwarma came without the khabus and the chicken was tasteless.
-baida roti was very very oily and tasteless."
"Ordered 2 different type of shawarma and received same. Both are disgusting, Chicken wasn’t fresh and felt like frozen dried chicken.

Ordered 750 ml Juice and received only 500 ml juice, Poor Service.
Expected good food for 620 rs and received not even worth 100 rs."
