"Please give the option of garlic bread against the lettuce salad.
W have ordered from here multiple times as we enjoy the meal combo, but this was the most unpleasant of all the experiences."

I have ask for cooking instructions but they donâ€™t even bother to follow and also ask for cutlery they donâ€™t even send are they expecting me to eat with hand or what if some ask for delivery they should know that what are needed to be send

"Momos were fantastic. But there was nothing classic about that Mac n Cheese. It was sweet, for some reason, I think from onions. Very weird taste and consistency. Two of us couldn't eat more than half."
Wow loved it soo much and who ever made it made sure I had the best experience soo thank you ðŸ’–

"The mutton in the biryani was old and stale that we got an upset stomach eating that biryani. Have eaten at social several times but didnâ€™t expect to get food poisoning with stale meat.
The biryani overall lacked flavour."

"Jain Food Option Should be available, Gulab Jamun was too much sweet, It should be normal sugar less sugar. Food preparations time always too much. They never follow any instructions. Restaurantâ€™s phone never available to contact, itâ€™s always switched off or out of coverage or fake line-busy tone."

no chicken found in butter chicken. gravy was substandard
"My order instructions not followed. Jain Food should be available, there are lot of Jain Food Customers."
Restaurant has not been sending oregano packs as it used to. First it skimmed on ketchup and now on oregano/chilli. Has happened multiple times in a row. Packaging additionally seems to be done in a rush and haphazard way. Not a good delivery experience.
"Omg. The worst spaghetti ever. It had French beans and onion it in, no garlic. Yuck."
Lovely foodâ€¦ found the salad a little underwhelming but overalll goood
Very bad stale taste of the covering layer of momos

late delivery
if there are multiple orders for delivery boy the preference should be for those who have paid for gold membership poor delivery experience and food was also not good as per price
"This used to be one of the best butter chicken biryanis in Mumbai. Absolutely horrible this time. Chicken was dry, barely any butter masala in the biryani & the rice was also hard & dare I said it stale. They used to also have some bouled egg in the biryani which was missing in the biryani. Tava paratha was missing in the order as well."
