"Yesterday i ordered Chinese food from asian spice, the quantity was very less as compared to the same food i have ordered before....the aluminum foil container was not even filled completely....also there was no schezwan sauce withe parcel....i am writing this just to inform the hotel management, not a complain...bcoz i mostly order the same food....the food was good no doubt in that...."
"Asian Spice has a good ambience, and serves a variety of Indian & Chinese dishes. The Chinese food is good here but they need to improve on the Indian section which is below average."
Visited this place sometime back for dinner. The ambience of this place is nice and peaceful. We had paneer tikka for starters along with veg kolhapuri and hyderabadi biryani for the main course. The quantity was good and pretty reasonable too.
Ambience is great with attractive decor. The food has been good in terms of taste and quality but the service is very slow. Definitely try chinese cuisine.
"One Of The Best Restaurant I Have Visited. Great Experience It Was. But Location Is Complicated. Parking Space Is Also Available. Great Ambience Clean & Hygenic Place. The Menu Is Full Of Asian Food. Great Taste & Quality. You Must Try Alishan Biryani.
FOOD: 4.5/5
AMBIENCE: 4/5

"For the first time in ma life i would like to thank my chicken eating friends cozz being with them i was easily able to identify that despite of ordering veg volcano rice i was been served CHICKEN rice y do they even have ratings option they dont even deserve zero stars infact this was a crime and alll i received in return was a mere sorry the manager didnt have courtesy to speak as well...

Apart from this veg starter we ordered took 35mins to reach ma table.. As mentioned dish would be having cheese stuffing there was no cheese as welll.... If you cant manage a single thing properly in your restaurant you should shut it down this is not how it works... Highly disappointed.... Also have...read more"
"Asian spice we went around this place for movie so we thought to have dinner at this place. At night time there was lot of rush and we were into waiting manager told us to wait in a rude way. The staff is really here is impolite and they really have to learn a lot how to talk to their customers, how to greet. We ordered food manchow soup cheese naan paneer tikka, veg crispy but guys this order literally took a lot of time. Service was bad Staff is unfriendly, they were not aware about the menu.
One of the worst experience we had at this place.
Food was very spicy and guys i would really not recommend this place to anybody. infact if i could have o star option then i would have given that...read more"
"As the name suggests, the menu is full of Asian cusines, from Bali to Bombay! I have been to this place many times now and I have never had any complaints about the quality of food.
The good food:
Chicken manchow soup
Veg lemon corriander soup (had traces of carrot, broccoli and baby corn)
Chicken tandoori (nicely cooked)
Hara Bhara kebab ( loved the flavor of cashew paste used to make the kebabs)
Burnt Garlic chicken rice (all time favorite)
Thai pot rice

The issues:
The wait time is too high
Sometimes the temperature is too cold to bare, hence can't sit on the sofas coz it gets the direct cold air.
The waiters keep opening the kitchen door hence there came few minutes during my last...read more"

"Good food!
Nice ambience!
Best place to dine in vasai!
Should try alishaan biryani!
Price range is quite good 15% off on take away!
Price 4/5
Ambience 5/5"
Though there was a confusion in the order placed but the delivery was done within a decent timeframe. The Chicken Lollipop were good enough. But the Dal Khichdi had chilli pieces in it though I had specifically mentioned that it was for a 2 year old kid and make it non spicy.
I have ordered regular Chicken fried rice along with Chicken hot garlic gravy. I must say this is the best Chicken gravy I‚Äôve ever had in this particular vicinity. Must try dish for everyone so guys do give it a shot. Thanks :)
It‚Äôs another perfect restaurant in Vasai üòÄ haven‚Äôt visited here but have ordered food many a times .. Price is bit high but is worth üòçWill surely love to visit here ..
"Try this place at your own sweet risk. While the food is good, the delivery is super slow. Each dish takes half an hour to arrive and to top it all the staff have no sense of courtesy to apologise or extend a thoughtful ear. Verdict pronounced: don't even think of going!"
panner kabab was half cooked only
too much salt was added in the soup.. bad experience
"A great ambience... A perfect taste for Food.. Ordered from a soup, a volcano chicken starter(a must try dish) and a alishaan biryani. Thank you Deepak for your hospitality... Ciao"
I ordered biryani which was good but it could have better at the given cost
"Ambience wise place is great. But the service is a big let down. We had ordered for soups nd starters , but it arrived on our table after 50 mins with multiple reminders. The staff was not bothered about the orders given. They were more focussed on delivery orders. Aftr havin starters we had to leave as we didnt wanted to wait for another hour for the maincourse to arrive. Just a feedback to the hotel, if u want to save the hotel please care for ur customers. This way u are heading to be the worst hotel which has great interiorsüòä"
took more than an hour and I had to go the restaurant to pickup the food plus the restaurant charged me 40rs extra
did not arrive on time and we have to wait for more than 1 hour
amazing service..like it üëçüëç
awesome shezwan rice
I asked for a chicken chilly gravy. but I received a dry chicken chilly.
Good food.
‡§ì‡§ï‡•á
"They accidently delivered non veg food to us. The delivery person then took the food back and bought the right order.
(All this was over within the specified time).
3) The American Chopsey was average but usual North Indian Food from Asian Spice tastes really good."
I had ordered Chicken teriyaki nd apple chicken nd both dishes were so flop...nd such a waste of money... teriyaki sauce was so disappointing... spoiled Easter mood with this wrong selection of dish and restaurant and vice versa
delivery boy should be aware about local areas...
food was very spicy and without salt . Also Manchurian soup was sent without noodles
Pathetic service. We had to wait for 1.5 hours for a soup and starter. The food we ordered wasn‚Äôt even ready after 1.5 hours. A lot to be desired in terms of service and food.
"There was no chicken in the wonton itself, wonderd if the chef forgot to put the chicken in it."
"Location is quite in the interior!
Ambience is good!!
Soup is good in taste manchow soup we ordered and it was really very good.
The starter quantity is also decent and we ordered veg crispy was sufficient and delicious
Main course taste wise is not that good.
I have order cheese naan and in that naan i found staple pin so be careful about this restuarant.
Staff is totally not cooperative and rude at times.

"Awesome food, timely delivery!!! The ambience at this is place really cool. One should definitely try Chinese cuisine served here, its yum!!!"
Have been to Asian Spice a couple of time's. Almost all the time's we've ended up ordering their Chinese fare. They haven't disappointed so far . The food has been good in terms of taste and quality while the staff and manager have been quite courteous.
Food is really good here! Good quality and quantity served by them.. Best desert ever eaten by me is the Honey Chips and Ice-cream made here..
yummy food
super food nd taste is awesome. plz keep ur taste as it is . Ur nan was soft nd had a great crunch in it. the chk picese were good engouh for 2 person
"Amazing food...best restaurant in Vasai..!!!
Try chicken angara kebab , it's awesome !
Moreover the service is good. Still there should be some maintenance with the A/C cause sometimes it leakes"
"Among the better Oriental food joints in Vasai. Good staff, location and fairly decent food. The best part is that they do not pepper their food with ajinomoto."
Worst service I have not seen bad service like this in any hotel the they even don't respond to their gust after call the service staff 2:3 tym they respond u once
"Was a Asian Spice on my Birthday had a great time...
Good Food
Courteous Staff...
Value for Money..
As I was not sure what to order so asked sever forgot his name but his suggestions and they were way too delicious.
Keep Rocking Guy's...
CHEERS !!!!!!"
Visited this place after reading the reviews on zomato.. well the ambience is good but it's not very spacious.. After reading the name I thaught the food will be great but I found it average..nothing great
"We decided to try Asian Spice to celebrate our parents anniversary based on reviews and we were down right disappointed!
Somehow the taste factor was missing!
We Ordered Chicken Lung fung soup and Chicken hot and sour which was ok
The murg tandoori was great and it is the only reason for positive rating
Chicken burnt garlic rice was dry.... We cud actually feel the individual grains of rice.. the BBQ Chicken chilly was almost tasteless. Absolutely regret ordering these two. Simply not edible (unless u don't mind eating hard dry rice with tasteless gravy)!

Chicken Kolhapuri was again ok ok...

Fresh lime soda hardly had any lemon juice and tasted just tad bit different from plain...read more"
"As good as the food was, the service was very slow. Unless you call them out for every single thing you will be sitting there forever. Left waiting for 10-15 mins minimum after ordering anything. The Chinese is specially good, try Apple chicken. Food and the decor are let down by the poor service."
"Have visited this place several times and the food has been good, so far! The place is small and the ambience is so-so. Service too is kind of full. Managers are impatient and doesn't make you feel relaxed or inviting.
My biggest displeasure goes to the fact that they don't serve cold or chilled water nor any ice and their argument is that you buy mineral water and don't go for RO filtered water.
My rating if 4.0 is purely for the food, it's presentation and the variety they bring in the menu."
"Excellent ambience, loved the butter chicken and tandoor roti, pricing is relatively high compared to other resto's , service is mediocre..would only suggest if its some special event not for regulars.."
The ambience and service is quite upto the mark. Also the food ordered for starters it was veg manchow which was good and chicken satay(not as good as a Chinese counter though) was fine. We also had paneer cheese roll(cheese was just sprinkled on top which was very disappointing) and the roll was very oily the sweet and spicy sauce served along was very tasty though. It is supposed to be a north indian speciality restaurant so thus the chinese dishes served weren't as good. Will surely go next time to try their north Indian dishes.
"First of all i shall comment about the service, which is absolutely quick and polite. Me and my husband had to catch a movie in an hour on an weekend, a slight request and the staff managed our meal well.
Second is the food, which is delicious and this restaurant now stands in my few anytime go-to lists of restaurants!"
"It has a very nice decor. The locality maybe a little inside but it's near a multiplex so it's not difficult to find out the place. The service is fast and the stuff is friendly. Even though the name says Asian spice, the Indian course is also amazing. It's perfect for a family dinner. I've ordered food from there at various occasions. I really like this place!"
"Placed near a multiplex....it has an attractive decor. Ambience is good and the most attractive part is its interiors..they have glass framed various spices..which is very apt for its name.
We decided to try a soup..so we asked captain to suggest some best ones. As suggested we ordered for chicken farmer soup. We had instructed specifically we dont want corn in soup but when it arrived it had corn in it. When brought to his notice..he seemed aware of what had been done but still unregretful. Soup was like a bland vegetable stock..with miniscule amount of chicken in it. No flavour .a complete waste of money.
We risked again for their suggestion..but this time we asked a waiter not the...read more"
The indian dishes on the menu sounded good and we ordered the Chicken bhuna gravy and chicken patiyala. We really enjoyed both the dishes. The starters we ordered were good too. Most of the dishes on the menu you would notice are either Chinese or Indian dishes.
Visited this restaurant on 31st night. Fairly small restaurant. The food quality is good and generous portions. The vegetarian starter was better then non veg ones. The service is prompt. Do not expect much from ambience. Overall a should try restaurant in the non alcohol category.
"The management needs to change the name on priority. This restaurant covers only India and Desi Chinese. The menu card however talks about Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, Burma, etc. Very very misleading! I was expecting Desi Chinese with batter fried chicken tossed in basic Chinese sauces but the worst was a batter fried satay. How can one go wrong with a satay. It's just about grilling n serving the chicken on a skewer! Our craving for Thai curry made us to go this place and I ended up eating some curry with the consistency of custard and as usual the batter fried chicken. Our curry was served to us not with steamed rice (as mentioned on the 'misleading' menu) but some very oily garlic...read more"
"The Chinese at Asian Spice is good but only when had in the restaurant  if you get your food home delivered, by the time the food arrives the oil that it is made in does not taste well. We had ordered Burnt Garlic Rice and Crispy Chicken Chilly, both were yumm. I find the rates very steep, just the burnt garlic rice is priced at Rs. 250. Recommended only if you are eating hot food in the restaurant."
"Am writing about the parcel I ordered and the experience wasn't great.
Such a sad pot rice..this is the second time I ordered and still it's the same..full of soy sauce due to which it looks like sticky black rice. As far as I understand pot rice should be in somewhat gravy and mildly dark."
"What a great place for food! Loved it and the ambience was good. Quality and quantity at the par for the money charged. The staff was good. The best part of food was POT RICE it was great. Nice place fellas be there and enjoy it. Will surely visit soon for non veg dinner.

Posted on 9-Dec-2017. - The hotel management needs to take the card swiping issue seriously as it‚Äôs been over 2 months they don‚Äôt have a machine. How much time does it take to acquire a card machine??? Is it so difficult? It really troubling as annoying. They haven‚Äôt even introduced new variety of food, no innovation and changes. Please learn something new."
"after reading the reviews out here, We decided to visit Asian Spice. Situated just besides K Movie star theatre, the ambience is good and well maintained.
Even the crowd is pretty decent.
We ordered for the Chicken Farmer soup, which was good and served soon. Up next we ordered for satay prawns. the prawns were fresh and the dish tasted yummy!
For the main course we ordered Volcano Rice (mixture of Prawns, chicken and veggies) The rice also comes with gravy. it tasted good and since we wanted to try out something different, this was the perfect dish!

The service, the ambience, the quality is good! Must try if you are looking for a cozy evening, with some good yummy food!"
"Good Place for a family dine...pretty quite..

Food is good with good portion and decent price....ambiance is average..its located just besides K Star Theater....

I won't say its a must try but definitely one can try at timings of cravings for Chinese food.. :D

Cheers !!"
"Good food , good ambience,clean place , altrough we just hd Chinese, nicely prepared,the only problem is that they don't have sizzlers, would lyk to visit again"
Had been on a date ordered prawns koliwada for starter...it was bland...tasteless...nxt was the wonton chicken...in which there was no chicken...food not upto the mark. Definitely not worth going.
Paneer tikka bahar masala and butter naan is the best thing to have here.And quality is really very good. Makes you feel good and value for money.
Had visited here with family it was a silent and nice dining. Ambience is nice and songs playing in the background works nicely while dining. Ordered Mushrooms dishes all were very good in taste truly enjoyed it. Have visited this place twice and both times returned happy. So if ever with family or friends do visit this place for nice dinner experience.
"One of the few good restaurants in bassein, food is just delightful and ambiance is very attractive, it's a must visit restaurant if you crave good food."
Been there with some friends. Food was average. Service was sloooooww. Maybe because it was a Sunday. There is a lot of waiting on weekends and holidays. We had to wait 30 minutes before we got a table. But the place was good. The ambiance was very good though. One thing good was you get a wheat tandori roti. Not that maida ones. This was very good. The servings are good in quantity. The prices are average. It won't burn a hole in your pocket.
"Went here on Sunday afternoon. Quite place. I guess we were the only customers there that afternoon. Firstly I wanted to have a mocktail, but they didn't gave any. A big turn off in this Summer. Had to settle down for fresh lime soda. We then ordered hot garlic chicken which was Good. Boneless chicken fried and tossed in garlic sauce with spring onions ,garlic. Nice spicy and garlicy taste. Next we ordered the murg Multani kebab. These were Super Amazing. Amazingly marinated, light on spices, nice juicy and served with cheese. This was my favorite. We next ordered the main course, that was naan and chicken lababdar, the gravy was good. Nothing exceptional. We finally ordered chicken pot...read more"
Good place...... Nice ambience.... Went there around 12;30 afternoon.... The food was served in time without delay....only thing is that the prawns pot rice was a bit more oily..... Else wud have given 5 stars.....
Very arrogant staff. Very bad customer service. three times returned dissatisfied and disappointed from restaurant. Improper space management. Phone numbers given on menu card are mostly unattended.
This is my first review on zomato. I wisited this rest today on my birthday with my family for the second time. But i must really say they are really screwup. First i visited in diwali with my family and due to waiting they gave us a isolated place to sit on the first floor which was part of a party hall. Basic service took 10 to 15 min. Today on my Birthday i decided to give them a second chance n went again. I am a complete veggie so ordered a cream of mushroom soup which was watery I asked to take it back n make it thich. They got it done fine but all hell broke lose i got a big Chicken piece. I showed it to the waiter n the chef n they both aggred it was chicken. As it was my birthday...read more
A great place in the small suburb of vasai virar to get your tastebuds closer to authentic Chinese. Great flavors and prompt service. Highlight is the subtle ambience. No alcohol served.
"Love the food here!! The chicken teriyaki and Shanghai potatoes are a must have. My husband and I frequent this place ..
I'd recommend Asian Spice any time. :))"
"Had been there for Dinner on weekday ,great ambience ,less space though. Food was good tried veg cuisine ..Mushroom masala & Paneer kungpao a must try ,couldn't try Non-Veg food as was with some Vegetarian family friends ,but will definitely visit again to try the Non vegetarian cuisine. Over all service was a bit slow which the management needs to work on!!"
"I was here today with my friends. The interior is quite warming. For starters we ordered Barbecue Chicken Chilli and Chicken Teriyaki. Both were delicious. The service is a bit slow, but the food compensates it all. We had dumplings too, tasty. We had the Murg Darbari and roti for main course. The food here is delicious. I would love to come here again."
"If you wanna have good blend of oriental and mughlai food this is the right place. Am a regular visitor since this place serves good Chinese food , everyone should try the signature wantons here. The rice noodles and gravies are excellent complimented by a very reasonable price tag. Tried Indian food and it doesn't disappoint either. It's one of the best restaurants in Vasai."
"Talking about the food, had ordered chow mein noodles and sesame chicken sandwich. The noodles were lovely, even the sandwich but it was little more oily. ( these sandwiches are small triangular pieces of bread with seasame, chicken and other garnishing)
The staff is well spoken. Talking about the ambience I liked how they have decorated it. Good place to be with your loved ones, friends or family."
"This is a nice decent place to come in with your family or hang out with friends who don't wanna booze coz yes there isn't any booze served here.. You've got options in food in terms of Indian or Chinese..

The place has nice interiors, good lights and also has a small screen to keep you a bit busy..

Tried the burnt garlic chilly in starters which were a bit too spicy even though we had ordered for medium spicy..
For main course tried chicken darbar with butter nan, which was well cooked and tasted yummy.. Food portions were good too..

Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Cost: 4/5"
"Asian spice i visited this place recently overall the ambience is good . The food quality and taste is really good we ordered Chinese , chicken gravy which was really delicious the only turn off was the pot rice . Pot rice was really bad in taste the chef needs to google the recipe of the pot rice . But other then this overall the place is really great ."
"The ambience of the place is really good and the interior is also very creative, the way they have put all the spices and dry fruits on the glass wall. The food was also really nice except the chicken pot rice which was too spicy. Rest we ordered chicken bhunna, chicken burnt garlic fried rice, chicken oyster sauce gravy, chicken sweet corn and clear soup and veg Hakka noodles which were very tasty and quality oriented. The pricing is also very nice.

A must visit place for Chinese lovers in vasai."
"Asian spice is a quite nice place to dine in wid family .Been there wid my family its a nice cozy place wid quite good ambience .The food here has Nice popping flavours and not too spicy .Great food and nice locality compliments this place . Service is fast and waiters are well informed and attentive . Best for chinese and thai cuisene has a great indian menu as well.
All together a nice experience must visit restaurant for all vasaikarsü§ó"
"well this place as to prove the name have the decor of spices on the wall. Ground floor ambiance is nice but bit cramped up.
When it comes to food ; it serves Indian & Chinese/Thai cuisine. Indian varieties are made with delicately spiced gravies & food quality is good too. The main reason I frequently visit this place is their Chinese food. Veg farmer soup , Malaysian noodles is a good combo as both are light on stomach. Starters are good and taste can almost match the real essence of east Asian food. Veggies & chicken they use have always been comestible. The head chef readily guides the foodie to satiate gourmet tounge.
I mostly find this place hugely crowded on weekends...read more"
Been here once gud ambience gud food .staff needs proper training they dun even wait for their last customer to move out and they are busy in windup their shifts..
Amazing food.....amazing ambience.....the service was also quite decent.......i enjoyed it......this is some of the best food that I have eaten......
"New place in Vasai. Lovely ambience. Livelier food.

Some staff need better training and they'll learn with time. But I promise, they've the best Asian cuisine in Vasai."
"Food was good. Ambience is also good. Place is a bit small but that's okay for small families. We get a variety of food like Chinese, Indian etc."
"The service and food are good.
The place looks a little cramped up.
Overall a good experience with family."
