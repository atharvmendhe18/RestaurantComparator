Review
"One of the most wholesome South Indian restaurants in Mumbai, this place is light on the pocket and offers some simple delicious food. Went there for breakfast and tried their Idli Sambhar, Rasam Vada, Masala Dosa and Sheera. Definitely recommended!

Taste - 4/5
Value for money - 5/5
Service - 4/5"

"The food is super. Very tasty and authentic. We had steaming hot Upma, rasam wada, masala dosa and potato vada. The sambar is different from regular Udupi sambar but is extremely tasty. The filter coffee and tea is also great. Over all, it's worth the waiting time. Staff is polite and quick."

"Extremely rude staff! The person at the counter thinks he is doing a favour by serving us. I wanted to have a coffee in the morning at 7.30 am, when there was literally no one but only one other customer in the restaurant. I wanted to read something on my laptop whole having coffee, so i opened my laptop. The waiter rudely told me not to open the laptop, on asking why, he asked me to talk to the person at counter. When I asked him, he told me ‚ÄúCOFFEE PEENA HAIN TOH LAPTOP BAND KARKE PIYO VARNA JAO YAHASE, laptop kyu nahi kya hota hain? Ek baar bola na nahi toh nahi‚Äù!!

"Extremely rude and unprofessional owners. My family and I have been visiting this place since years but our latest visit completely ruined the place and the experience for us. We were 4 people and luckily, we got a table together after a 30-min wait. We asked for Idli Vada and the waiter said due to a large parcel order, idlis will take 10-12 minutes. We agreed and one of the members ordered a dosa in the interim. Once the idli vada arrived, we ordered a crispy butter sada dosa - which the server, after 10 minutes brought a cold, soggy one and ASKED US if this works. We said no and he said he will get us another one. Meanwhile, 2 members of our group left as there was a long queue outside...read more"

"We visited this place for Breakfast today. The wait time was not as much as the other restaurants around it. We order the Rava masala dosa, upma, ulundu masala dosa, filter coffee and masala milk. The food was good and services was fast. Overall a very good experience."
"I have been going to Sharda bhavan since 1976,even today they have maintained their quality.Pls don't go on ambience it is simple and still what it was 40 years back.Butter crispy sada dosa ,you have to ask them for extra kadak is one of the best.Their Upma,Idli meduwada are mouth watering .Sambhar is unique with little extra of coriander powder.And last but not the least Their filter coffee is best in town.No charges for extra sambhar and chutney.Must visit"

"One of the oldest south restaurants, this one is a favorite! The interiors are simple but the taste is awesome! The Disas, Idlis , upma, Sheera whatever you order, the taste of it will remain with you! Have visited it so many times, and this one surely wins hearts! It's a hidden gem!"
Only feww places where I prefer to eat south indian and this is one of them. Love the authentic food they serve in an authentic style.

"Mysore sada and medu vadaü§§

üìç Sharda Bhavan

Rating : ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

If you want to try authentic South Indian dishes then you should visit Matunga.
You'll get many options here. However, mysore dosa from Sharda Bhavan is the best. Vada was not too oily, coconut chutney and sambar is absolutely tempting.

"Sharda Bhavan has been there for a very long time in Matunga. Needless to say that their food and ambiance reflect an old-world vibe. I remember visiting here with my father as a child and nothing about this place has changed yet. No fancy seating, very simple decent staff and a long queue of people waiting as usual. Had the masala dosa, upma, idli, medu wada and filter coffee. Filter coffee was strong and aromatic. Everything else was delicious and yum too. Limited menu, good sized portion and reasonably priced. Taste still the same over the years. Definitely a must-visit for the authentic south-Indian food lover!"
"I tried maysoor masala dosa, idli, medu vada, coffee. Too much costly and taste is also average. Sambar and chutney is good."

The ambiance is ok but service is dam super quick food is really reasonable n place is really clean n well maintained u cn try each n everything worth fr money must visitüëçüèªüëçüèª
"Authentic South Indian Food - Sharda Bhavan well knowned for its filter coffee right opposite to Matunga Station always pleases your gluttonous vibes abruptly. Waiter behaviour seems to be a problem . Kindness costs nothing . No complaints about the food. Everything is always perfect and taste too is up to the mark. We would strongly recommend you to try Dosas , Uttapam and Filter Coffee. Ambience is simple yet elegant and definitely takes you back to the 1970s and 1980s. Sharda Bhavan is a big YES from our side for all the South Indian food cravings."
I keep going there for my dose of filter coffee. Sharda bhavan feels like home because of the coffee :)
""
"I ordered ulundu Dosa, coffee and Mysore sada Dosa. All of them being my favourite ones.

The service is quicker. The ambience is basic and seating is rustic. It reminds of the old restaurants I used to visit back in south India.

Mysore Sada Dosa is crispy, it has authentic taste. Butter which is generously added in all other Dosa parlours is not added unless asked for. Coffee is strong filtered one. Just a required jolt for the workday."
"Sharda bhavan is compact place in Matunga East, always crowded best known for the South Indian food .Opens up at 7:30 a.m.

Food :
Serves authentic South Indian dishes we had .
1:Medu vada served sambar / rasam
2.Upma: it's also served sambar and chutney nice way to have your upma
3.Idli : Warm and moist just the way it should be.
Don't forget to ask for dry chutney nice way to give a twist to your basic palette
Visit to South Indian cafe is never complete without having authentic filter coffee.
Chilled atmosphere nicely ventilated it's quite pocket friendly."

"We came here a week ago on a Saturday gor breakfast around 10am. Surprisingly was quite empty though it started filling up by the time we left just before 11am there was already a que. I definitely didnt like feeling rushed towards the end as we had our baby finishing her meal.

We shared:
- idli. Good
- medu vada. Very nice
- kela bajji. Yummy but bit oily
- ulundu masala. Very nice but heavy
- onion rawa masala. Very nice

Food overall was great. Chutney and sambar on the spicy side (if you come with kids). Service is efficient and fast. Prices are sooooo affordable. Place is chilled out and spacious compared to other packed and small places in Matunga.

We asked for some hot water and...read more"
"Jain mysore sada dosa tasted delicious. The dosa was crispy and soft. The paste of mysore dosa was so good, that you can have it without chutney. Coconut chutney and sambhar had a proper South Indian taste.

Idli was fine. Its taste was a bit salty neither it was soft, whereas, Mendu vada was good-tasting, it was crispy and worth having.

Filter coffee was purely a South indian coffee. Good-tasting and works like a cherry on cake after having South indian breakfast."
I like this restaurants dosa and medu wada. Chutney and sambar are quite different from the other restaurants nearby. This is one of the oldest restaurants in Matunga. People from South Mumbai are often seen here. Their Upma is the best served in Matunga. I have been many a times here with my family and have had a nice dining experience.
"SHARDA BHAVAN MATUNGA

MATUNGA is supposed to be the birth place of South Indian cuisine in Mumbai .

There are varies old cafe in matunga serving Irani and south Indian delicacies , but this is the best south indian cafe in Mumbai so far , there is no competition , I'm writing this with my heart .

Starts from 7:30 in the morning closes till 9 pm
There staff is the best all from Karnataka wearing lungi and there style of serving filter coffee is mind blowing .

I ordered

1. Masala dosa
2. Idli wada
3. Filter coffee

There chutney and sambhar are so thick you can taste all the authentic spices added.

Dosa , Idli wada cannot be defined in words you need to go there and have it.

"One of the oldest udupi joints. Lots of natural lighting ,cross ventilation, clean.
Must haves

Upma
Ghee sada dosa
Kadi wada
Filter kaapee

The staff is very courteous.

They dont refry the vadas. They will serve it cold but not refry.

Close sharp at 8.30 pm."
"Probably the most underrated South Indian joint in Matunga . A very simple place , not much crowded but the food is just awesome . One of the best Mysore masala dosas I have ever had . Service was quick and staff was courteous."
"A small cosy joint around the corner just outside Matunga station. Unlike other cafes, where you find queues and crowded seating, this is a relief. Quick service of South Indian food which scores more or less at par with anything else.

Our breakfast started at 7. 15am and went till 8.45am without anyone else disturbing us or hurrying us to move on.

Good dosas, nice Upma, fresh nimboo Pani and Upma.

Do give it a try if you wish a change from likes of Madras Cafe and Mysore Cafe.

Also, look at rate card. Value for money and good hygienic south Indian food. Ideal for a post run breakfast friendly session."
"For authentic South Indian food and hospitality, Sharda Bhavan features in the 'You Must Visit' club. It has its own history, opens early morning and is close to Matunga Railway Station. The snacks and Kadi Wada are a must have. Do not forget to order filter coffee, which shall be poured into the glass by the traditional South Indian attired waiters. The furniture is comfortable and vintage giving you the feel of sitting in an old styled restaurant in modern times."
"This joint is opposite Matunga station.

Must try their signature dishes including,
1) Radam Vada (vadas dipped in a bowl of rasam)
2) Ulundu Dosa (thicker variety of dosa with jeera)
3) Bunn Puri (slightly sweet and soft goodness)

Drown it all down with their Filter Coffee (awesome authentic and south indian kaape).

One of the only restaurants where the waiters still wear lungis.

Smiling and fast service at affordable rates.

Simple ambience."
"Matunga is a hub for South Indian delicacies. This is again one such place where I have been eating since my childhood days. The ambiance is decent with small tables and chairs. This is a non AC joint and the service here is very quick .

I can vouch on the taste of the sambhar and chutney, and hey are very authentic.

The quality and taste of the food has been maintained since years.

They do not have a menu card , they write all the dishes in the board and check out from the board once the dishes are over.
I go here for it's Upma, idlis, dosa, Mysore dosa and filter coffee.
Do try out this place to relish some authority and amazing South Indian food."
"Mind and stomach satisfying
Had Mendu Wada, Sada Dosa and tea
Amazing taste, Mouth Watering
Next time will visit once again definitely trying out new dishes
Love it and also pocket friendly"
This is one of our morning coffee place. Love the aroma of filter coffee. Had ordered the mysore Sada dosa. This is one of the few places in matunga that you will find open on a Monday. And you certainly get rid of your Monday blues at this place.
"Again one of the oldest restaurant serving South Indian delicacies, and of my favorite place during college days.. it's situated bang opposite to Central Matunga rly. Stn.

Happened to visit this place after a long time.. it's still the same with same polite staff in their lungis, crowded and people sharing tables.. with consistent sambhar, Rasam and chutney taste..

Ordered Rasam Vada, Rava Masala dosa, Rasam Idli and no South Indian delicacy is complete without a filter coffee.

Quick service, Pocket friendly... A must visit place for all.."
"It's a good place and serves majorly South Indian food and an amazing filter coffee.
Additionally there's poori bhaji which is not a typical South Indian dish.
It is closed on Wednesdays and usually crowded during the afternoon as there are a lot of colleges nearby"
"Again an oldest n simple vibe udupi restaurant , but the food is delectable nd wholesome , sometimes worth craving for. Their mysore masala/ pori dosas are perfection in their gastronomic journey. Sobo peeps just line up on a weekend to refresh their childhood memories and it's still easy on pocket compared to other nearby udupies. It's open cafe vibe and strict timings make you think that it runs for a food experience & not for money.
Great place to share some dosas,idlis, upma,sheera wid a dash of its original filter kapi."
"All the places around Matunga serves awesome South indian food. Sharda Bhawan is one of the oldest Food joint.

The place has a limited menu but every dish on the menu is worth a try . The sambhar, rasam and even chutneys have a distinctive taste.

The decor has the classy old age charm and those Wooden chairs will make you bit into the old times."
"Authentic South Indian food available. One of the best places to satisfy your south Indian cravings
Love the place. A must visit when in Matunga."
My all time favourite joint for a good plate of idli and Upma. The sambhar here has tasted the same since years. The furniture is the same and so is the staff. The coffee here is outstanding and the dosa is also yummy. Try the mulga pudi with the idli and dosa.
When ever I want to have South Indian food this is it...!!!! Very simple and basic interiors. You must ask for the Dosas to be made in ghee... e.g. Ghee Sada or Ghee Masala the flavour that the ghee adds to the dosas is awesome... Have been going to this place for almost 15+ years and it still exactly the same it was back then...
Good south Indian food and coffee. Value for money. Concept is like a normal udipi joint. You order eat and leave quickly. Tables are also shared mostly if there's a long waiting. Service is quick.
"Am not sure why this place is highly rated . Went today for a quick bite after office . The place is old all right with basic set up of wooden chair and tables. All ok but why isn't the place clean. I found it poorly maintained in regards to hygeine and also the water . The cleaning table cloth was stinking and kept near drinking water.

The place is actually well known for variety of dosas but with ambience and hygeine I decided to settle only for plain dosa. The dosa was crisp but the batter was a mix of Tamilnadu and Karnataka. I wasn't satisfied with the batter that they used also had less salt in it. Sambhar was average without any subzi in it and chutney was nothing great to rave...read more"
"Matunga has many south Indian joints, and shradha bhavan is one of them.
Service is quick.

Dishes I tried--

1. Sada dosa-- nice and crispy dosa, served along with chutney & sambar. 

2. Mysore sada dosa-- Dosa, topped with red chutney, crispy, served with sambar and chutney.

3. Rava sada dosa-- rava dosa always turn out to be crispy than basic dosa. serve along with coconut chutney and sambar. they should also serve tomato chutney, which will add a different taste to the overall dish.

4. Tomato onion uttapam-- Average taste.

A typical place with typical old times ambience
But who cares when the dosa is fresh hot and yummy
I love the rava dosa they serve‚ù§"
"Fast service, very good food and ok old style restaurant.

Tables can be on sharing basis here since it's busy throughout the day.

Try to come for breakfast and have a great start for the day!"
"Prompt Service
Simple look & great taste along with it's prompt service makes it legendary

I tried Dosa which was crisp & superb.
The uttapa was uncooked in some areas but was awesome .
Coffee was typically made like an South Indian Coffee a bit bitter & sweet that's what I needed as a refresher or to go over a hangover.

Must try :-

Uttapha
Coffee
Bonda"
"Sharda Bhavan has 3 standout items. The Kadi Wada which is so good and so consistent, The Mysore Masala Dosa - which I think stands head and shoulders above the rest in the area and the Kela Bhajji. The Bhajji especially when you get it piping hot is just yumlicious. The decor has not changed since a good 4 decades. The stone topped tables and chairs have remained the same. Happy to say that the taste of the food is also consistent. For those who want interpretation on availability - if a item on the menu board is half slid out it's not available."
"This Legendary outlet is situated diagonally opposite Matunga C.Rly Stn. Every item on the menu is a must have, specually their coconut chutney ! Its a No Nonsense place, to have good food. Each & every dish is prepared with Authentic south indian spices and ingredients. The place is simple and interiors are vintage with less tables which is nice."
"If you're looking for comfort food in matunga, this is the place! It's a small place near matunga Station that won't burn a hole in your pocket. They have a limited menu & I like their butter sada dosa the most. Filter coffee here is authentic and the best compared to other south Indian restaurants in Matunga. You can also try their kela bhajiya and other variety of dosas This place is underrated and I'd most likely recommend Sharda Bhavan."
"All time favourite place to head when you crave for good delicious south indian food. 5 star for their food ,service,value for money.
The place is just opposite to matunga railway station.

"My favorite place! It's been there since years and still hasn't changed much. I love going there for a quick bite. The upma here is a must try. The idli and wada have a typical south Indian touch that you wouldn't want to miss. All the dosas are worth a try, but my personal favorite is the Mysore masala dosa with the powder chutny. ‚ù§"
"Hi all,

After a long time took a home delivery from this place.
I ordered the following:-

1) Idli wada:-
I ordered the classic idli wada for starters and i must say the idli was soft and the wada was crisp too.
The chatni was really good and the hot wada went well with sambar.

2) Tomato onion uthappa:-
I had requested to make it crisp which they did make but may be the onion got burned a bit if you see the pic.
But the overall taste was good.

Verdict:-
Overall its a nice place to have south indiab food.Though its not as famous as ramashraya or cafe madras but you can have a good quick snack over here.The sambar could have been better but chatni was really nice.

"One of the oldest restaurants serving authentic South Indian food. It‚Äôs ambience hasn‚Äôt changed since about 40 years and is still so welcoming.
Reasonable priced, it‚Äôs not only a favorite of localities but also a favorite place for people from South Mumbai. Their Sambaar and Chatni are absolutely ‚ÄúUnique‚Äù. I bet, You won‚Äôt find their taste anywhere in Mumbai.
Tip: Ask for separate Green Chatni(dry). They charge a meager extra, but that will add a completely different feeling of being satiated.
They serve filter coffee made frothy by pouring it from a height into a steel container right in front of us. Worth many many visits."
"This place is a home eatery away from home. 

The food here is extremely simple, authentic South-Indian and absolutely no frills. 

Don't expect five star service here. Seat yourself, share tables and once you are done, leave if you see a crowd outside else the servers will request you to. Don't raise objections to that as that is the preferred norm here. 

This is the way here but come here on any weekday mid-afternoon and you have this place to yourself. Seat yourself, order your filter coffee and spend some alone time here. It can be quite relaxing.

It‚Äôs a an old establishment serving South Indian cuisine.

We tried their Butter Sada Dosa and Mysore Sada Dosa.

‚Ä¢Butter Sada Dosa
I asked them to make it naram, and they did make it naram. It was delicious and buttery. Tasted well with their Sambhar too.

‚Ä¢Mysore Dosa
It was like any other Mysore Dosa, it could be better if they used more oil/butter in the masala paste.

‚Ä¢Special mention
Sambhar was amazing! It was nothing like any other sambhar served at other South Indian eateries in Matunga."
"Authentic south indian food. If you are in Matunga or dadar east try out this pocket friendly restaurant. Very close from Matunga station. Yesterday visited after long time and ordered meri vada. I was very hungry and after order within 5 minutes, hot and crispy vadas were in front me.
Filter coffee was also good, only thing you will not get very hot coffee (which I love).

Overall 8/10"

"Visited this place yesterday. Located very near to Matunga station, is one of the south indian restaurants in Matunga giving typical south indian dishes other than just normal Idli Vada and Dosa. The only concern about this place is that sometimes the food is not cooked fully, tastes a bit raw. Their chutney has the most unique taste and one should always go for double chutney instead of the usual sambar which they serve (they charge extra for extra chutney otherwise)
Food, Ambience and Staff: 3/5"
If you like a simple South Indian place where you get silence while eating and no disturbance then this is the best place to go for after ramashray. This place is quite old an have maintained there name since a very long time. The staff is dressed in a simple South Indian dress code and they serve amazing upma and dosas with nice chutney besides it and they also serve the array milk juices at there restaurants.üòäüëçüèª so if you like my review do check my Instagram post as well i.e- foodthatyoucravefor @Sharda Bhavan

we tried Mysore dosa, Idli, Upma, Coffee and Nimbu paani.
Dosa loved by everyone followed by Upma.

"Sharda Bhavan is situated in Matunga. It is one of the oldest restaurant in this vicinity. A simple small cafe. Having limited dishes to offer. So i went here as i was super hungry and i was around this place. As i visited this place in evening, i ordered a Sada Dosa and a Mendu Vada. The Sada dosa was served with chutney and sambhar. The Dosa was crunchy and had that south indian touch, while chutney and sambhar were also perfect. P.S. They charge you everytime you ask for extra chutney. After which i ordered the Mendu Vada , the Mendu vada which i got served was not fresh and wasn‚Äôt hot too. The place is good for having Filter Coffee, Dosa and Idli."
good food... unique chatni and sambhar flavour. old irani hotel feel. everything on the menu is good. mysore sada dosa is great. they even serve single idli or wada so you can sample a greater variety.
Nice restaurant for south Indian breakfast. We had Wada sambar and onion uttapa . Medu Wada was crisp and not oily served piping hot . Sambar and chutney was ok. Onion uttapa was crisp . Taste was very good. Rates are reasonable . South Indian coffee is must to end breakfast . Overall very satisfactory experience.
"Simbly live the Upma and Filter coffee. And the way he does mixes the sugar with coffee concoction.

I remember going off route while traveling early morning to office, only to buy Upma to have it at office with the office collagues.

Even till date my father's actually find work and prefers meeting his friend at Matunga. So then they can catch up at Sharda Bhavan to have their staple food -Upma and Coffee.

Way back, in 2009, even though I was shouted once for opening the laptop and waiting for food to arrive. I could not resist the temptation to go back and order food there. I do realise it doesn't make sense to work and eat, now.

Now I go with friends, wife and kids to introduce...read more"

I went with my wife to try something authentic & enjoy a small bite over conversation.

The staff in veshti are warm & fast at serving all its customers.

Had ordered ghee dosa & medu vada. Sambhar & Chutney were bland. Taste wasn't up to the mark & I would not be able to recommend this place to anyone unless the authentic taste is worked upon again.

A disheartened & upset customer ü§ê"
