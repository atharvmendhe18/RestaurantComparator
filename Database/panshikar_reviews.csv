"Had ordered Special Misal and Ragira Puri Bhaji
Was priced properly and also delivery was before time
Taste of food was good but Misal was too oily and the taste of Puri Bhaji was delicious"
"Food wasnt fresh at all
I just ordered misal pav and corn patice from u guys
Corn patice was smelling its 2 3 days old
If u do not have fresh food to serv dont take online orders
Zomato is the site where we get tgs facility to get food easily but noone wants to eat basi food firat thubg in the morning.
Very disappointed!!!!"
"One of the best place to eat fasting items. You will not get place here if u reach late on ekadashi, sankashthi , Thursday and fastiv time.

Must try

Farali misal
Sabudana vada
Piyush"
"The best misal in Mumbai!!!! If you are a misal lover, this place is a check in your bucket list of Mumbai!

Wonderful place in Mumbai serving mouthwatering and quick bite snacks. It is a typical Maharashtrian cuisine restaurant with a variety of fast friendly options. Must try batata puri and piyush (a sweet but filling beverage). Keep some space in your stomach for this beverage.
"Fast food is available here
Best food ever had
Servicing is fast
Ambience is too cool
Its small place but best
There is value for money here"
"I had order shrikhand Puri , Veg samosa & Misal .

Shrikhand Puri - The quantity was decent , the taste was average & value for money ( 80 rs )

Samosa - The samosa wasn't even hot till the time I received it . Taste was okay & value for money ( 60 rs)

Misal - This was the most disappointing thing , being a maharashtrian I have tried misal at many places the quantity was decent but taste was below average & value for money

Should focus on proper packaging ( shrikhand was hot at time of serving ) .

I would recommend this place being not hard on your pocket , hoping they might work on reading my feedback .

Thank you üòä"
"Nice ambience and good foood. Would love to review this place and also they have a great maharashtrian taste.
Overall it was just perfect...."
Mom got 250gm shrikhand for Dasara festival. It was worst . First of all highly priced and totally not worth it. The shrikhand was sour. It totally ruined our celebrations and the experience to savour shrikhand puri became a fiasco.
"So I tried this restaurant on a fasting day. This place had mixed reviews but I still went to try their FARALI FOOD.
The food was totally worth it. To my amusement everything turned out to be extremely tasty, mild flavours and non oily.
Special mention to their Coconut Chutney because it was first the first time I tasted a Chutney which was a mix of sweet and spicy. It was purely an add on to the dishes

I ordered-
1) FARALI THALIPEETH
It was a flat item with sabudana. I loved the taste and the fact that it had very less amount of oil

2) POTATO PURI
It tasted really well with the chutney. A nice filling fodo to go fo

3) FARALI PATTIES
It was round in shape, covered by Farali flour, it...read more"
"They have a variety of farali and snacks items...u should definitely try their kothimbir vadi, Sabudana vada and batata Puri and their Piyush..."
"A small Maharashtrian restaurant located near charni road station. I went thr with my cousin to try misal pav. Taste was just ok.

Taste - 3/5
Ambience - 3/5
Service - 4/5

"Delicious Authentic Maharasthrian Food @ Panshikar !!

Upon my visit to Mumbai, a lot of locals recommended Panshikar Aahar,

I was going through the menu, took staff advice
on what to have from the different varieties of misal here. Then they suggested me ""Farali Misal"". it is Popular not just during fasting, but otherwise too.

First appeal of Farali Misal was Distinct, what i have had before, it used to be Brownish Gravy, here at Panshikar the misal off white colored Gravy, that is i Guess Coconut is a reason. 

Taste of Farali Misal was very light,
it was not spicy, no feeling of oil, that may be  ""Misal"" has mixture of Sabudana, Singdana (peanuts), Sev, Alloo & Coconut in...read more"
This place is famous for a lot of food items made and originated in Maharashtra.. I mainly visit this place to have piyush.. Piyush is combination of lassi and shrikhand.. It is really very good to taste
"Taste 4/5
Service 3.5/5
Ambience 3/5
Value for money 3.5/5
Recommend- yes yes
Food is tasty and that's what is important. Staff could be customer friendly and that would go long way in positive direction.
Best part is their sweets (padhe) waah, a must try."
"Panshikar stands for quality and taste. I ordered from Swiggy at home. Masala bhaat, Sabji, Balli, Gajar Halwa, Kesar Jalebi. It was heavenly meal. Must try for all veg fans out there."
"If anyone wants to taste and enjoy authentic Maharashtrian food, especially snacks, Panshikar is PLACE to visit.
All the classics such as Kande Pohe, Thalipith, Sabudana Khichadi, Kothimbir Wadi,...., and Crowning endless list is Misal Paav and Batata Vada....as good as anywhere. It is just too confusing to decide what to order as i always wish to eat everything that is there on offer.
and that too for less Rs.200 per head....

Have visited the place hundreds times but the taste has remained same since i remember.

A place where we get true value for money...."
"I suddenly felt a urge to have Puranpoli so I landed alone to this place.
Walkable distance from charni road station based at girgaon this place serves Maharashtrian food.

Well its actually two places..one is for food and other one is for sweets where they have everything from Kaju katli to Rasgulla to Ukadiche Modak.

Coming to Food !!
Kothimbir Wadi-Tringular pieces made with chickpea flour.it was semi moist and fresh but what i liked was peanuts used in it. it went well with coconut chutney.

Mango Lassi - Usually Mangoes and lassi dont mingle together everytime. but this drink was superb.In my case this drink was a winner!!

Gulab Jamun - Scrumptious in taste but it did...read more"
One of the most awesome Maharashtrian foods in Mumbai!! My parents say the taste hasn't changed a bit since past 50 years.. Now that's truly commendable!!
"This is one of the best marathi food joints in mumbai. I m visiting this place for last 25 years. Simple seating. Best option is that if u r fasting then this place will feed u like anything . U get food for fast ‡§â‡§™‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ - in MARATHI v call ‡§´‡§º‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤ .

Also hotel is located in the old world charm of Girgaon. 5 minutes walking distance from Charni Road"
"Want to eat Maharashtrian snack? This is the right place then. From spicy misal pav to delicious sabudana vada, everything here is tasty. You can have a quick bite at an affordable cost. The service is superfast. Must be here."
"The day started with a trip down memory lane as after 4 years I finally visited Panshikar at Thakurdwar with my friend.. Having constantly praised the place in front of her I was surely apprehensive over the outcome of the food.. Like usual Panshikar did not disappoint a lot and it certainly delivered on most of it's promises..
Firstly, Panshikar isn't a place for roomy decor and large seating areas.. Despite being a small place at Thakurdwar corner, it is a hub for delicious Maharashtrian food.. We ordered the Pharalachi misal and sabudana wada to start off.. My friend who had never had this misal before was definitely surprised by the dish put in front of her.. Both the dishes were...read more"
"Good food , variety in menu , quick service. This is what you expect at any maharashtrian restaurant and this is exactly what you get at Panshikar . If you love Maharashtrian food than you must come here atleast once."
I was at girgaum for work and I was starving courtesy hectic work schedules . I happened to spot this on the way . I have lived in pune for 4 years and anything typical Maharashtrain instantly attracts me . I hopped for a masala rice and misal. And it was delicious . The whole menu for a typical Maharashtrain fare . Wish I could try some more . I'm looking forward to visiting there again!
"One more maharashtrian eatery close by my residence. The garam sabudana wada with the chutney is mouth watering. Special Missal Pav even kothambir wadi , farali Misaal and piyush are a must try at this place."
"Went to try the maharashtrian cuisine with family, and Panshikar has left me happily surprised! Try their misal, kothambir wadi, thalipeeth if you haven't experienced maharashtrian food. They also serve fast items on Mondays. Great experience altogether :)"
"The sabudana vada and kothimbir wadi here is good if you are around and wanna have a quick bite. I haven't tried their farali misal, which they're known for. Have been here only once, but the staff is friendly, service is really quick and I must mention that they served hot items. And yes, this place is pocket-friendly. Will surely visit again if I'm around Girgaon."
"This place along with its sister concern Sweet Shop are part of life for my family,

None of festivals , Fasting or Happy event get complete without offering Pedhe , Barfi made by them to God and distributing it. Always fresh taste and light on pallet , along with controlled use of sugar make them best.

Fasting menu consisting of Sabudana wada, Khichadi , Potato dishes , Thalipeeth are excellent in taste and for ritualistic people they guarantee no use of Garlic and Onion etc in there kitchen ever.

Must visit if u in Girgaon vicinity"
Its one of those places in girgaon which serves maharashtrian (especially faral specialities) . Their misal is made of vatana which i don't prefer its far from original.They serve farali misal which i didn't like as its made of peanuts and potatoes .sabudana khichdi and vadas are ok.
"The service is good. This is suppose to be my favorite place from my child hood. Distinct Maharashtrian menu to serve you.

."
The perfect place for the faral and upvaas items. The food ? is so tasty ? that you won't even realise that you are actually doing a fast. My favourite here is 'Sabudana Wada' and 'Farali Pattice'.
"Offers the best Puran Poli which I have tasted so far. Simply outstanding!!!
Malai Pedha is also unique and has quality.
A delight for Maharashtrian sweets & heaven for sweet lovers including me ;)"
"One of the best places to eat Marathi traditional in Mumbai. Along with it's flagship Misal Paav and Batata wada, there are many dishes that will make you wanting for more. Rationally priced with portions appropriate for quick and tasty snacks anytime of the day. And you got try the piyush, a creamy sweet drink a perfect way to finish a meal. True value for money..."
"Typical marathi shop and best you can get in this area!
Sabudana wada with awesome chatni and piyush or lassi. What else you require...???
Crowded on fasting days still worth waiting.
Happy fasting!"
"Special Missal Pav at Panshikar Aahar (girgaon)!! Never disappointed!!! Even kothambir wadi , farali Misaal and piyush are a must try at this place."
Panshikar is a good place to have lazy Sunday brunch. Its super sasta (meal for 2 would cost about 400-500 rupees) . so.e really delicious maharashtrian delicacies served hot. They have a very homely flavour . would recommend the thalipeeth which is served with homestyle makkhan! Must visit for those lloking for good food presented in its simplest style
"Saturday morning.. late breakfast and we find this place with good ratings in the vicinity! Wah. Maza aa gaya!
Items ordered
Thalipeeth- never had better. Served with loni and the amazing coconut chutney.
Amla juice- boring concentrate based. Tasted like ginger lemon
Kothambir wadi- the pic says it all. Trust me it tastes better than it looks.
Cold masala milk- super.
Service was quick prices are great!
I just hope this wonderful cuisine does not die out with thw generations and they can revolutionalise it for the modern times with quick serve outlets etc!"
"One of those old Maharashtrian restaurants where you can have typical marathi jevan (food). Sabudaana Wada is my favourite topped up with a glass of piyush. Good place getting a munch during your upwas. Ambience is ok. Food flavours are excellent.

Recommended for upwaas."
"Finest place for authentic Maharashtrian dishes..upavas misal, sabudana vada, batata vada are too good but thalipeeth here is my all time favourite.
After your snacks don't forget to grab a glass of piyush..!!"
Use to eat here almost every day for one and a half year. Most authentic veg maharashtrian food some1 can have. Deluxe misal and the upvassi misal are just outstanding. Rajgira puri bhaji and normal puri bhaji are extraordinary. One glass of piyush will be enough to fill your tummy. :p
good snacks. I love the vada pav and sabudana vada here. Sweets are typical marathi sweets and nice variety of chiwdas. lots of high calorie and cholesterol rich food. But yum. try misal as well. its quite close to charni road around 250m walk. restaurant and dry snacks are in different shops on same road 50-100m away from each other.
"One of the finest marathi snacks corner.
All kinds of misal are good.The thalipeet and kothimbir vadi have unique taste.One of the main attraction is Piyush its yumm, different sarbats are best thirst quenchers.Its one of the best places for people who fast.
