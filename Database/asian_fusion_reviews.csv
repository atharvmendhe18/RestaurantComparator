"Brilliant in taste! It's been some time I've eaten something that hit my taste buds so very well, that I went on to recall the famous phrase ""Yeh Dil Maange More, Aha!""..Wonderfully crafted and well cooked to perfection! Very satisfied and full marks to the packaging, quantity and quality of the dish...."

should remove from must try category
"too salty, not worth it today"
Awesome
Too spicy either mention it is spicy or atleast mention ingredients of dish. The momos coating was too light that it got toar till it deliver please work on that
"food quality is not good ,it's tasteless n they are using D'P container to deliver the orders,if they doesn't have there own then why they are doing so,is it leagally possible to use others name for there own profit"
