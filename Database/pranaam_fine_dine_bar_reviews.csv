packet seems to be pilfered or the portion size is less. There is no seal tape on the container. Seal tape on top of package is improper.
Food has been taken back by the delivery boy.. not delivered.

we always order briyani from here. but this time the briyani didn't taste good and it was stale. didn't expect this from your restaurant

Today your packing is very poor
Wrong parcel was sent to me .. had ordered for chicken masala and received kaju masala and normal roti instead of butter roti
"fool of chilli, lots of water required to consume,kindly look into this, ask chef save chilli save money, save water ( in morning) at customer premises"
""
the food quality was not good after having food from here. i am suffering from throat infection
""
overall good taste
They made it too spicy. The tadka masala was all raw. Daal khichdi is supposed to be eaten by children or sick people. Total waste of money. Couldnâ€™t consume more than 2 spoons

It's not Chinese it's like Dal Rice which is made by the worst mad of the house.
Chicken was less cooked
"Itâ€™s very disappointing to get this quality of food from such a reputed food chain.
No piece of chiken is good . Only rejected pices I got ."
I ordered full chicken makani but there was only gravy with few very small pieces chicken
"This is what I get when I order a handi chicken.
I am getting some Chinese dish, can't believe what exactly this is.

Very dissatisfactory.
Please look into it.
Don't make us feel as if we are fools by delivering anything that you guys want."
I didnâ€™t get pickelðŸ˜¡
