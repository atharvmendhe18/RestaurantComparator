in both the pizza there was only one paneer piece on each slice of pizza. not at all worth for the amount spend. makhani sauce pizza did not have any cheese and it felt we were eating only maida base. waste of money.
The domino’s delivery boy was very kind and well behaved

Undercooked pizza and when told the same to the manager (Charkop store) then he is denying and said that this pizza is like that only so I should assume as per dominos that this pizza will be undercooked and I’m supposed to pay for undercooked pizza

"pizza was half cooked , soggy"

I ordered a cheese burst but the quantity of cheese burst was too less. Domino's is reducing it day by day or the preparation of food was not done considering the order. #Disappointed by Domino's. Highly reputed brand but service is not disappointing.
