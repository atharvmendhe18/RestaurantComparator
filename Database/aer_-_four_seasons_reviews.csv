Review
The food was average and really expensive but the view and ambiance of the lounge made up for everything. The night time view was breathtaking!! The person who was serving us was also really nice and we got a table quickly.
Great Ambience üòç‚Ä¶ The view was to die for !!!
The ambience is great but the food is pathetic and tasteless. If u want come here only for drinks
"One of the best in the city . A view and ambience everyone craves for .

The menu should increase for more of dining otherwise the best place to drink and hangout.

Worth a visit ."
"This is has been by far the WORST experience as a dining one. The staff, especially the floor manager was arrogant and not at all welcoming. I had called the property before hand to ask if reservations are possible to which the response was walk ins allowed. I asked if there is a limit to the amount of time one can occupy a table and the response was walk ins are allowed which did not make sense. When we went at 9 PM, the moment we sat down we were informed by the floor manager that the time limit to occupy the table was only till 11 PM since a party was to take place which is ridiculous for a 5 star property. We were asked to leave our table mid dinner due to which we only ended up...read more"
"A great place with a great view with a potentially good vibe destroyed by pathetic management that cannot get its act together in managing what could easily be the best rooftop spot in mumbai.

A place that could be defined by good times is unfortunately clouded by sloppy and slow bar service and rookie mistakes.

The service staff is kind and understanding and the responsibility clearly rolls up to the management thats done a shoddy job of defining how a good establishment runs"
"How can they not have FRIES!
Disappointing!!"
"Fantastic view, service and experience! Would definitely recommend!"
"Looks can be deceiving; this place has fewer seats than a game of musical chairs. It's extremely cramped, the waiting period is forever, and they take no reservations. If you're lucky, you will win a seat and a good view.

"KARTIK at AER is one of the rudest staff i have encountered. We were put on guestlist and the entry was supposed to be free before 10:30 pm , he straight up denied that even after showing him the proof on chat. Very unprofessional for four seasons. Etiquettes just come with good dressing. Horrible!"
"I recently attempted to make a reservation at this restaurant, but my experience was incredibly disappointing. Despite multiple attempts to call and book a table, my calls were never answered. This lack of response left me frustrated and with a negative impression of their customer service.

I believe that good communication is essential for any business, especially in the hospitality industry. The fact that my calls went unanswered not only wasted my time but also made me question the restaurant‚Äôs professionalism and commitment to its customers.

I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and improves their reservation system. Potential customers deserve better service, and a...read more"
Its the view u die for . Excellent service and spectacular ambience. A must visit rooftop lounge in Mumbai
"I had heard about this place a lot so went to this place for some drinks and dinner with a friend.

We ordered cocktail and wine. The cocktail just tasted only of water since the entire glass was full of ice. We also ordered chicken and truffle and walked around with our drink to enjoy the view.

After the drinks when we xame back to the table for the food, the waitress blurntl told us - u didn‚Äôt order any food, u placed the order and said we dont want food (I mean, seriously?) why will we place the order and say we dont want it?
Since it was late , she said the kitchen is now closed so u need to go somewhere else and have ur food (what a service!) We were supposed to roam around at...read more"
"It being a Saturday night, Aer was overly crowded and there wasn't a system to manage to the crowd either. There were a few available tables but we were told they aren't and hence had to wait in line at the bar, for a table. Moreover, there were people coming in after us that were easily seated and we were still waiting for a good 45 mins until I ran out of patience. The person allocating tables at the time was Ms. Beena, who was a tad bit rude and dismissive right from the beginning. It was only after I could wait no more and questioned her about others being seated before us that finally got us a table! The experience after that was very pleasant as our server Kihi was very attentive...read more"
"Visited this place for the first time since its renovation ‚Ä¶ they have completely ruined the place ‚Ä¶. The old ambience, vibes, interiors, food, service everything was just upto the mark ‚Ä¶ really disappointed"
"The experience in itself was a bliss. Faint drizzle, scintillating ambiance and food so ambrosial. I was looking for a serene place for the date and wanted it to be special too. And the staff just brought along such elegance in the experience blended with sheer magic of gastronomy makes it nothing less than- chef-d'oeuvre."

"Visited the spot on Saturday for business purpose and we were thoroughly slobbering over the delighted nourishment served to us we had dhingras punjabi breakfast,paneer makhani biryani."
"I celebrated my birthday in four seasons wroli and it is really amazing place to celebrate i love the ambience and sitting place beautiful sunset from the top amazing view. Drinks are good but I didn't like the food they should increase the food menu. It is really over priced so costly according to the taste. Music is good overall it's great place to visit atleast once for the view ...

Food - 2/5
Ambience - 4/5
Sitting and view - 5/5"

"Nice View.. Yes! But Spectacular? Meh!
2 Sections they have (1st facing the Sea, the 2nd facing the corporate jungle of Mumbai), make your pick once you are let in. The Stairs leading up to the entrance actually have a fantastic ambience & a gr8 place to click pictures.
Decent Cocktails, Food is Lousy, Service is not upto the mark.
The only saving grace is the Music & the Crowd that picks up after 10 pm."
Horrible service. Person in charge called Pawan had no respect for his customer. Made us wait for half hour and then said one of our guests will have to sit on a stool and he wouldn‚Äôt provide an extra chair. There were other tables to accommodate us. We were two guys and two girls who were finely dressed and he suggesting to take a stool for a small table wasn‚Äôt acceptable at all for such a reputed place. Hope the management teaches the staff some hospitality and respect. Will never step my foot here again and will definitely not recommend this place to any one.

"They don't take reservations and won't even let you know if you enquire about any private events scheduled. When you reach there, they would just keep you waiting because the place would already be full and the waiting doesn't get cleared till very late too!

Absolute lack of planning and table management."

"Awesome view with great ambience, quality food and professional staff. A place worthy to make your evening memorable. Special thanks to Pankaj from team AER"
"We went to this place to have a great feeling from the top of the city.
There were no reservations allowed but when we reached and took the table. It is open from 5 pm onwards. The manager informed us that there is reservations at the same table from 7.30 pm onwards. The directions on the staircase could have been better as a lot of the people were not sure where to go for aer. We sat took the amazing vibe of the sun set. It was windy and you can see the entire south Mumbai almost.
Bar was only one side. The other side of the place was not so vibefull not sure why.
We ordered pizza chicken tikka one and it was amazing. They also gave compliment Ary masala peanuts and chruncies which was...read more"
"The only best thing about this place is the view. For food they have limited menu which is overpriced, service is way too slow. Plus, they don‚Äôt take reservations, we literally had to wait for 15mins-20mins."
"I hate giving a bad review however the only good thing about this place was their view (5/5), everything else was very very bad.
1. They didn‚Äôt take any reservation even on a Monday evening and made us stand at the bar for around 20 mins. The person writing down the names and contact number had no clue about what he was doing. He gave table to people who came after us.
2. On getting the table, the service was so slow. The waiter didn‚Äôt remember to punch in our order two times. Always missed a dish.
3. The quality of the food was very bad. I‚Äôd not wish anybody to eat such items for such a huge price.
4. On ordering dessert, they made us wait for 20 minutes only to come back and...read more"
"The worse part is that they don‚Äôt have a reservation option. I went there at 9:45 pm and got a table at 11:15 ish. The person managing the reservation has no clue. They have a preference for people staying in the hotel and outsiders are pushed last in the seat. If you see empty tables and they still don‚Äôt give you one, get pissed or sit there. That‚Äôs the only way to get a table"
They asked us to wait at the bar with no bar stools even to hang around. The place gets totally full even before 7 pm and they don‚Äôt take reservations.

"The place was good and staff were very nice, specially Binod who was very helpful thanks for making our weekend great."
"This bar brags that it is the best in India. How could they possibly tell? Whatever! It's rooftop location is a great vantage point for admiring Mumbai's skyscrapers. The staff is friendly and the international bar snacks are excellent. Expensive, but you'd expect that and maybe it's worth it.

Be aware that this is NOT accessible. You need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the bar."
Expected a good experience at Aer! Turned out to be a bad one. No space to sit and even after waiting for an hour did not get any table. The help desk was far away from being helpful. The food was below average! #NOTRECOMMENDED
""
Food & cocktail options are limited. Tried ‚ÄòThe O Eight‚Äô cocktail and would rate it as one of the worst ever cocktails I have had! The ambience is nice and the staff is courteous! Highly overpriced for what‚Äôs in store! Expected a much better experience.

"The Ambience is just wow, but you have to wait for a seat for toooo long. Like literally we had to wait for the seat for more than 2 hours.

The food options for vegetarians are limited as well for non alcoholic. I even don't remember the drink that they served as mocktail and in food after a long wait we just had oven crust cct pizza which didn't taste good. It was too blant.

If you are just looking to spend time with a view, you can visit this place other wise I wouldn't recommend this place to a foodie person."
Very limited options for a vegetarian meal. Would have loved it if there could be more options for veg people. Loved the ambience

"The view is really good n if u are a sunset lover then these place for you lovely ambiance great option for beverages and finger food

"AER LOUNGE , located at Four Season‚Äôs Hotel, Worli is one of finest places to chill around and my personal favourite lounge since years. AER lounge is located at 34th floor, and this place is rated as the best rooftop in Mumbai for years.
This place is famous for the sundowners and you can see the entire skyline of Mumbai.
The staff is customer friendly, deep blue ambience with amazing bar deck accompanied by very soothing music by the DJ. Perfect place to go out for date, quick service and they have good options as sides. Breezy Rooftop and they have happy hours every day from 5pm - 8pm.
Bartenders are very customer friendly, we were assisted by Bartender Harish who just provided the...read more"

"Apart from the music, man going back to Aer after 6 odd years was a major let down, esp during Valentine's Day. Covered by so many bloggers as the perfect place to spend your Valentine's Day; it was far from it. Pathetic wait staff, had to wait like 30 mins for a drink. Crowded AF during CoVid-19, kidding me? Aer is not a place for quality drinks; funny as it sounds I like Gokul better minus the glam."
"Aer, Four Seasons. Great food with a great view is what I would say. Located on the 34th floor of 4 seasons.
Visited this place over for a date and had a great time sipping on the lovely cocktails and delicious food. A little bit heavy on the pocket but it's absolutely worth it I feel.
The truffle fries are the best to go with the drinks."
"What an amazing place
Superb ambiance with finger licking food
We tried veggie & cheese Samosa
And CCT Pizza
But more then food the ambiance was super cool and romantic"

"Really liked the place, its ambience would amaze you. Must to go with your loved one. Even staff is also kind."
"Had a perfect birthday evening at Aer lounge. The lounge has 2 parts, one has city view and the other part has sea view. The sea view side is best, overlooks Mahalaxmi racecourse, Haji Ali, Nehru planetarium, etc. The ambience was perfect. The music was awesome, perfectly suited the view and the ambience. We ordered a few drinks and some food (Nachos, Mug Tikka & Sprout chaat, Crispy chicken & cheese pops) The taste was good. Only thing I didn't like was limited food choices. The menu doesn't have much to offer. But overall I liked the place very much."
"It was with a lot of expectation that we decided to explore this place, however, to my surprise it was nothing short of a disaster. I mean there was nobody there to attend when entered, finally we had to make an effort to find someone to help us with our table and then it was a whole different story with food. We were served with spring rolls, nachos and shawarma as starter which again were terrible. An evening which was meant to be special ended up spoiling our spirits big time. Besides the crowd was not meeting the expectations and top it all it took us a great amount of howling to get them to give us a drink. This was an overall terrible experience I mean the worst for me atleast....read more"

"If you want to have a good time, go to Janta Bar.. they probably have a better idea about what service and taste is.

Also... saving this review to repost it everyday hoping that I might just save you from getting into a place with full energy and then just sitting like a doodie"
"We had gone to the super recommended Aer Lounge on a Monday night! However, to our disappointment, all the good seats were taken and we had to wait in the bar area. The staff however, was super courteous and offered us a bowl of peanuts while we waited.
We tried the coffee apple cocktail (non alcoholic) and also a mixed cocktail of fruit juices. Finally we found a place after about 30 min, and could then enjoy food. We had the cheese pepper pizza and the Thai spring rolls, however the menu for vegetarians is extremely limited. All in all, a must one-time visit only and especially for the view!"
The view was just awesome food quality is yummier can resist visiting this place soon quality is awesome

"This place is not at all worth it, the money you pay for the food or for the view is just waste. Idk why is this place hyped so much. We had to wait for an hour to get our food served & when the food was served it was cold. The only good thing was their staff who were polite rest nothing is good about this place."
"The view from 34th floor is breathtaking.. Try to reach the place sometime before the sunset so that you can see the sun and in sometime enjoy the lights as well.
We took the seat near Bar area as it had the sea view.
The staff is polite. Food is average. High on budget.
Soothing music plays in background.

The cocktails were delicious. Although, there aren't good options for vegetarians, yet one can have a good evening there."
"The only good thing for you about the AER will be not to go. Even though if you end up there, don't dare to eat. Worst food(Vegetarian) I have ever had. Some samosa and paneer pav, it was terrible. Just go for a view, have water and probably a drink and come back. Nothing else is even close to worthy."

The perfect to visit this place at night, looking over the city.

Hotel management is real polite and helpful.
Should visit this place at least one for the experience."

"A perfect place for a dinner date. A bit expensive but worth the money. The ambiance and view is something you can never get anywhere else. Food wise the place is decent, has an elaborate menu.
Overall this place is perfect for a dinner date and an exceptional dinner experience."
