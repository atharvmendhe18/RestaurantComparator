"I would recommend this restaurant! I ordered Chicken Tandoori which was good. The outer coating of spring roll was a little thick, which affected the taste when it was ordered for delivery!"
they messed up with order. I have ordered mutton hyderabadi biryani. but I received chicken biryani that is really sad I was not in situation to reorder or complain at that time. although chicken biryani tasted good.
Authentic flavors and a vibrant atmosphere! The menu featured traditional dishes executed with precision. A great place to explore a variety of tastes from different cuisines.
The handi was too salty.

Very late
Taste was good. But too much include shimalaa mirch
"Delicious Chicken Tandoori Masala, the chicken was perfectly tandoored and the masala was very tasty."

"After many visits can share my experience as follows.
Basic ambience but ac upstairs. Waiters dont bother much after you place order and till you need anything. So it's good for 2 people as well as large group.
Wont recommend Biryani and Indian non veg.can go for Indian starters.
Had tried butter chicken and asked waiter if it will be tandoori chicken he said yes.
We got served boiled chicken in some gravy not at all like butter chicken. Other time mutton biryani was bad..mutton undercooked.

So better to drink and eat bar snacks and chinese and Indian starters."
not value for money. half quantity . very low quantity

"as always amazing, good portion & good taste ...."
As always delightful to have food from Ashwariya.
"It's my weekly spot to hang out specially evening. Sea food is really tasty price wise & it's pocket friendly
Ram always juggling between tables but keep a good eye on everyone & always around to help.Service is spot on .With the price point & large selection of menu everything is perfect to unwind after a long work day. I prefer outside sitting but inside it's comfy & cozy too.If you are someone who is always looking to explore different pocket friendly places for good food & booze it's a must visit place .I am sure you will be not disappointed."

"A decent easy on the pocket place to have a couple of drinks. The place is filled with a crowd of all age groups. The chicken platter is a really nice choice for munchies to have along with drinks.
P.S if you are too full with alcohol and not too hungry, try having their dal khichdi. Served piping hot, easy on the stomach but hits the spot in terms of flavour."
"A good resto-bar located in Sion-Trombay Road, Chembur.I think it's a non-ac bar.The service was impressive."

"Something cool you need to sit and relax in a fine dinning in chembur,nice place to be seated. Very good atmosphere for everthing you want to enjoy an evening with your partner. Good ambience"

"The ambience of this place is really nice and customer friendly. It makes the perfect mood to sit down and have a drink with friends. I visit often when I have the time after a hard day of work and the service is decent. The food tastes good too, especially the starters and the pricing is pocket friendly. Overall a nice place and my experience has been really good so far."
Have ordered multiple time from this place but yesterday had an awful experience.. Ordered chicken fried rice and when we ate it tasted stale so sent the meal to the restaurant and ask them to change it which they did.. when we ate again it tasted stale we sent it back as a genuine patron of the restaurant shockingly we got a reply that everybody is eating the same and nobody complained thus left the parcel there only and asked them to keep it with them as we have better things to do then play this game with the restaurant
"Bumped into this small resto bar in the vicinity and the food was simply delectable. Enjoyed pomfret fry and the burnt garlic on the side was to die for. The kebabs were succulent and flavorful.
We have been experimenting with the places where we find a good fish fry and we are glad we stumbled upon this place. This place will leave you in aww if you are looking for a good delicious meal but the ambience might disappoint you a lil.
Do visit Aishwarya Resto Bar for the pomfret fry.

Food: 4/5

Value for money: 3.5/5

"Service - 5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Ambience - 3/5
This is apna old fashioned bar where food is not very costly against popular myth. It is all decently priced & good to the palate. Visit this place if your around diamond garden in chembur & are looking for some quick bites & cheap booze."
"Whenever I visit this place, I always order Tandoori Chicken. The taste of it is just awesome and nake you feel crave for more. But the only issue of that place is cleanliness and lack of space."
"Aishwarya is one of those rare pocket & women friendly local bar. They have open sitting right next to footpath. They also have indoor & ac section, indoor section can be hot I prefer outside section. It's buzzing with guys & gals so a good ambience.

Things I have tried here ~
Chicken Arabi Tandoori - It was nice tasty may be being a Sunday lil undercooked but still very good. It's a white Tandoori marinated in cashew nuts paste & cream. It was little sweeter to my liking but am a fan of it.

Rawas Koliwada - Fish was fresh cooked to perfection. Salt & marination were precise hence the fish tasted it was on par with fish u get at Sion Koliwada. It was yum & shall have it again next...read more"
"I made a bad choice of ordering Chicken Angara from here. Not to mention, the taste was below average and the gravy was not at all good to taste. Will never ever order again from this place."
"A perfectly organised Restraunt to satisfy your hunger pangs! Nicest paneer butter masala I've had in a while with some deliciously baked Butter Naans!
Satisfying services and a Comfortable Ambiance!
A must visit for the localites!"
This review is based in my first visit. The place is a bar. The service is good and they are very prompt in helping with the service. They have a variety of drinks. What I really liked is the food. I didn't order main course. But the bar nibbles were very good. The only part that I need to write about is that there won't be many female customers. That's all. Thank you so much.
"The food is good. But please avoid to order it through Zomato. They don't have professional delivery boy. Today I got the order after 1 hour post following up with Zomato. The delivery boy is rude, does not understand gps location tracking and inspite of delay delivered a broken packet with Pudina chutney on it. he was so shameless that even after knowing the box got smashed because he put other things over it, did not apologise rather"
"Chembur's reply to Gokul. Though not half as good. Probably they could dim the lights more. Or serve better food. On the alcohol front, they got it right. Cheap booze. And if you happen to be a student of TISS, you get additional discounts."
"food is very tasty here and cost of food is moderate....i prefer people to go here.
chicken lollipop is very tasty here and one can get good drinks here and Moreover environment is very good here..."
Aishwarya is a restro-bar located at chembur opposite natural Ice cream. Ambience is not good so much but food quality is little bit good. They give discount for TISS students. They have variety of non-vegetarian dishes. It's not a very much expensive restaurant. Overall it's a good place for hangout with friends.
Best
Not cooked properly
ok tandoori chicken.. nothing too great
Quiet tasty.. its like little spicy reshmi kebab on black pepper.. they cooked well and its soft
"Good, budgeted hotel in Chembur at a prime location preferably for friends and not suggested for family. One unique thing about the hotel is it's outside seating arrangement with open space. The liquor and food prices are cheaper compared to prices of other restaurants in the vicinity area. Talking about food, Pomphret tawa fish, egg curry are worth for a try."
GG

it was perfect.
good
