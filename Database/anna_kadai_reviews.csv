Review
"Heard abt this place frm my frnd...
A very nice place to hang out with ur frnds! Ample sitting arrangement... Good music... Service is good too! Food was nice... Prices are way too reasonable according to the quantity! Its kinda isolated... But a nice place to enjoy!"
"Went to this restaurant last weekend with friends for dinner and it let to disappointment. Service was not good, chicken was not tender and its ""so called"" gravy was not good. Firstly waiter told us that we would get complementary salted peanuts and roasted papad with drinks which were charged in bill. Was surprised to see they charging us 1 beer amount in the bill which we never had.
Much hyped Resto or I got the worst experience.

P.S. :- Check the bill twice before playing. :-D"
Awesome place to hangout with friends. Alcohol priced reasonably and they have mouth-watering dishes too.. You'll definitely come back for more. Love their kebabs!
"The ambience is definitely intimate , but the food was slightly intimidating.
We went as a group of five , the Veg Crispy was simply a vegetable pakoda withe extra garlic and the Veg Triple Rice came minus any schezuan ( whyy?) .
On the other hand , the Blaster Pepper Chicken was succulent and just the right amount of spicy and the Dum Biryani fragnant and downright sumptuous.
The Blue Lagoon as a mocktail has a promising taste and a disappointing size.
The service was very accommodating if just a tad bit slow."
Amazing place to dine n booze ...ambience is simply beautiful .. A simple dal khichadi after two packs down will drive u crazy :-D..one of the best in n around.
I love this place !!! Dis is our regular hangout place !!!soft music nd al !! Overall an awesum place to be wid friends nd familyn !!! Nd food quality upto the mark !!!!
Try the surmai rawa tawa fry here...brilliant!! Superb place for non-veg lovers...especially their sea food! The ambience and service are exceptional
"Best place I've been to in dombivali, period. Booze is reasonably priced. They serve nice sheeshas too. But the reason I keep coming back is their food. Specifically, their kebabs. I haven't had kebabs of such good provenance at many other places, and my kebab palate is rather difficult to please. The angara kebab us very highly recommended, and I can safely say this is the best of its variety I've had anywhere. Special mention for their hot Rasam shots, served gratis as a welcome drink. Please, please ask your server for them."
The best thing about this place is that it has very comfortable seating where one can relax and have great fun with your friends/ colleagues....ambience is simply great and it gives you different feel of the place...i am not satisfied with its service as i think it could have been better...this place is perfect for food and drinks and also they have good options for mocktails...this place is located in the interiors so one might find difficult to reach here....i would recommend one to visit this place with your frnds....
"One of the best place in Dombivili to unwind !
In a mood of trying fish ? go have Basa preparations here - surely worth it
Want some lonely time with friends ? Go to this place peppy music, big screen and lively atmosphere
Planning a romantic lunch/dinner with GF/wife ? Go and sit upstairs, elegant and classy seatings available for your perfect date.
With friend and only want to drink and drink ? Well they have a special place which is separate from their main seating, where you can experience typical bar side experience yet classy !

Been here several times and not disappointed even once.
Food - 5/5
Value for money 5/5
Service 5/5
Definitely a place worth repeating ! See ya soon"
"Been there for dinner with my friends.. Well, firstly I must appreciate its a good place in dombivli to hang out with family n friends..decent ambience.. Little sections made for group gives a nice look to d restaurant..
Good quality and quantity of food.. Starters and main course was very nice with good taste and adequate quantity ..
Drawbacks are the service provided is too slow..it takes time more Dan usual in other places..
Another drawback is menu hasn't been updated on zomato.. So prices r high..
Overall good place to be"
"A good place to hang out with friends and family. The ambiance is really good. Food is good, service is little slow. Crowd is nice. A nice place to enjoy sports with friends. We prefer eating less oily versions of food here. I personally like Paneer Zed pepper, its a awesome starter, different from what we have usually. Cheese tukdi is a very lightly spiced starter good for kids and people who do not wish to have fried versions of starters. Veg Biryani, Dal khichadi, etc in rice are also a good to have. Below are my ratings for all the elements:
Food: 4.5/5
Food Portion: 3.5/4
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 3.5
Hygiene: 4/5"
Its been good having a restro like this with reasonable rate besides your home.. Must try for food i will recommend is prawn starters dry.. Good place to hangout.. Perfect interior for freshen up after a big day as it has been done by my father ;)
Food was ok. Good for guys outing. Too far away for taking your family. Ambience is good like a dhaba where you can stretch out your legs. Bog screen. Best to go out when you have good sporting events. There is a separate room for group. All in all a great place to hang out with friends.
"It's definitely a value for money restaurant. Although it's not a big restaurant and feels bit out of space during weekends, but the ambience is good. During cricket season they switch on match. This restaurant was suggested to me by my brother.
Food is good.. They don't have much variety to offer but whatever they serve is good. Specially non veg. Paneer and other veg dishes are ok not great."
"I visited this place 2 days back wid frns...all i knew was gr88 review abt d place...bt d place disappointed....

The AC was not working....d service was bad...d chicken items we ordered tasted strange...veg starters wer average...

And to add to our disappointment der was power cut...or rather i shud say POWER FAILURE....i dnt knw wat was wrong...bt we wer in dark for abt nearly 20 mins wen d generator started...and d generator went down in next 10 mins...leading us to dark interiors yet again...
So we finally decided to leav after 10 mins...seriously didnt expect a good restaurant to not hav a proper power backup.... Hugely DISAPPOINTED..."
"This is my 3rd visit to Anna Kadai in as many months and by far this one was the best.. The Tandoor and Indian dishes they serve are simply mouth watering.. One must try their Chicken Tandoori, Chicken lahsooni, Mutton Rogan Josh and Mutton Chop Masala. One word of caution, the service will take some time but that's fine given the emphasis given on food quality... Looking forward to trying new dishes on the menu..."
The policy regarding delivery amount very much worst that I had been experienced with Anna kadai.I had ordered for two people for Rs.400 they spoke me minimum order we take of rs.800.How's this possible for two people to take thus quantity which is too much than our hunger.I also requested to them from my end to take delivery charges because it's only 10 minutes walking from hotel to my location.I will not order again ...........
"Visiting 3rd time, this time the poorest service.It took 35 mins for the food to be served, oily plates and uncleaned glasses,messed with dishes.
Please take care, as previous visits were pleasent"
"Me and my frnds decided to try a new restaurant and we unanimously agreed for anna kadai. I had heard from many frnds that it is a good plave to party.we decided to book a special room in advance. The room is just like room in our house and a group of say 7-10 people can party in private..
The room was very well maintained with tv running telecasting ipl match.
We first ordered paneer zed pepper and the starter did match to our expectation. A different preparation for paneer in white gravy which may look like its sweet but the moment u taste it u would feel the spice..
This was on recommendation of the manager dat we go for this starter and it did work out.
We also ordered butter kulcha...read more"
"Anna Kadai has a fantastic ambience to start with..!! The food is also great with a lot of options to choose from. For non-vegetarians, you will love the spread available on the menu card. Service is good too. Though we live in the interiors of Dombivli (Rajaji Path to be precise), Anna Kadai has never declined a home delivery order from us. That I believe has impressed me heaps & bounds. I even suggested this place to one of my office colleagues & he was impressed as well. Keep it up guys! Will keep coming over."
"One must visit this place at least once to believe it. Excellent food, good ambience and not to mention, prompt service. Located in Dombivli, it's an fantastic place to organise get together with friends and family."
a thoughtfull creation of the owner great food great music everything is thumbs up me n my frendz enjoy celebrating our bday starters are great . chinese fiid is good to taste n mocktails great
Good ambience.....quick service and importantly.......great food..... that too at reasonable prices !! Big screen to boot that plays out EPL / cricket matches which makes for an enjoyable dining experience !! Best place in Dombivli for dining !!
And ordered few juices.. Blue lagoon and orange juice.. The presentation was great for juices and starters was also nice. Tasty but bit costly ..
"Anna kadai is awesome restaurant.., 'Chicken hot pan' is my fav dish.., music, theme, service is good
As ma side, It is best restaurant in Dombivali for hang on with friends..,"
"The place has good food, and if you're a seafood lover you won't be disappointed. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant is quite pleasant, for both dates and gatherings. The staff is a little inattentive, so that's irksome. This place hosts various events, too, like live music and other such stuff. Overall, Anna Kadai is satisfactory in all aspects."
"I would bet a All-IN on these restaurant
Starters-Too good.
Main course - Too good.
Desserts- Awesome.
Ambience - Extraordinary.
Service just awesome.
Thumbs up to the EDM (music)"
"Nice cozy place to be with friends and family. Loved the fish. And service was real good. Calm environment with booze and great food, what else you need after hectic week."
Had lunch on a Sunday Afternoon...Nice place wid good ambience..They have a good wide screen in which they play cricket and football matches.. Food is average...Same goes wid service too...I need to explain to the waiter what we had at the time of billing...this was quite embarrassing..
"Anna Kadai . Has an Inhouse DJ Station . ""Beat Station"" . Certainly you cannot complain about their taste in music. Decor will surely make you click many selfies *clicks a selfie too* Seafood lovers should be happy here . Service could be a lil faster and better . Food portion size is considerable. A bit over priced.Prawns pullimunchi is a total delight. Classy Ambience coupled with young crowd makes you sway with the flow. It also hosts many parties. Management is quite actively engaged. Overall a good experience.

Conclusions :
Food Quality - 4/5
Portion Size - 4/5
Diversity in Food - 3/5
Ambience - 4/5
Service - 3/5
Hygiene - 3/5

Wasn't aware about this restaurant until last year and I am glad that this place opened in Dombivli. I love the food especially the South Indian Non Veg preparations. Basa Masala Fry and Prawn Pullimunchi remains my favourite dish here. I will definitely keep coming here and recommend everyone staying around to try this place.
"Very good restaurant in the neighborhood. They have a very good ambiance and away from the busy streets of Dombivli.  Nice place to spend time with family and friends and chill out. Very good range of non veg food. However, very less variety in veg food."
"The perfect ambience and good food combo to hv grt fun with ur dear ones...????

Specifically on the day of occasions it is always the best option... The service, music and ambience makes u feel special and makes ur day even lively and wonderful"
"Ambience and decor of the restaurant is great. Its a beauty to be precise. Coming to food, some snack items are good but main course is very bad. Seems to be of bad quality or to say inferior food products used. We ordered chicken lollipop and it was tasting stale and it was indeed old chicken which may have rotten. We complained to the manager there and they didn't replace or provided refund for the item. We just left out of the restaurant that moment itself. Cooking and food quality needs to be improved a lot. I may visit again if it improves in future as I liked the beauty of the restuarant."
"Ambience world class foood yummy seating arrangement pretty cool been there loved it , guyzzz must visit place in Dombivali and now they have even started hukka want to visit again to try hukka"
"Naa not so good
Ambience ok ok
Food ok ok
Waiters need to learn how o serve...instead of spilling all over the plate !
Music...Duh I have better collection and loud speakers @Home :/"
This has been a regular hangout place for me and my cousins. The ambience is great. The food served is well prepared and so are the drinks! The portions are moderately sized. Value for money place!
Ambiance of Anna Kadai is awesome.Music ???? played in AK is also very good ....its good place to hangouts with your loved ones and frnds.......there is an ample space for parking ......Food and service is great .............
Best place to hang around with ur loved ones... It not only serves the best taste but the music also makes ur mood to hv fun & cherish every moment

Anna kadai is my One of my fav restaurant as it serves south indian cuisine and the ambience is out of the world .The seating arrangement is indian baithak which is very comfortable. All in all we need such places in dombivli 2 hang around with family n friends.
"One of the best restaurant in
Dombivli...superb food & great ambience.. must go place!!

The
south Indian food is delicious...had watched the FIFA finale at AK.. fabulous
atmosphere & nicely arranged events."
"One of the best joint that Dombivli offers. Lovely ambience, especially on a gameweek. Food is exquisite, quality and taste are above par. Service is also above the levels of what you see in many places across Mumbai. Special request from our group to add Jal Jeera, with soda without Boondi in your menu. Definitely worth a visit again."
Good food n ambience..there should be more restaurant like dis in Dombivli..need to improve seating arrangements a bit..rest other things are good.
"Pretty decent place to spend time with your friends , food and ambience is also nice , parking would not be a problem over here ,once you had been here ; their will be definetly a second visit soon ;-)"
"Wow.. What a delight! The shorba and the Anna kadai special biriyani was really lip licking! Must visit for a good treat!

Good place for food and drinks. Ambience wise its a 4. Has tables and baithak above. Only drawback veg food doesn't have options and just average. But if you are a hardcore non vegetarian.. Order chicken chetinad..my friend seemed to go all gaga over it. Good service and all in all a good place to one time visit for veggies n non vegetarian people you will visit a few times more i guess..!
Superb ambience. Everytime we visit this place have a small memory of every visit. Its a joint where friends can meet and enjoy anytime. Superb place :-)
Wonderful ambience..nice non veg food esp. Chicken zed pepper...bt price is 2 high esp 4 alcohol and even food is highly priced..they need to lower d prices after all the place is in dombivli tht too not in prime area..service was nice n prompt..wud hve rated them more if not for such high prices
"I visited this joint out after reading great reviews here and I was disappointed. While it does score high on the ambience and decor, the food is below average. The chicken dishes I ordered were especially tasting odd, almost stale. Veg starter was okay and the neer dosas we ordered with chicken ghee roast were good.

I will recommend avoiding chicken items here. Service is okay."
Awesome place. Nice ambience and seating. Variety of delicious food and drinks. Taste of food is nice. A South Indian flavour in many dishes. Njoyed.
Best food creative ambience and friendly service. That's what makes a good restaurant and they have it all.
"Anna Kadai, a restaurant as a foodie...not good at all....right from the starters till desserts..waste of money going here...Anyone who visits must have surely noticed it. 

Ambiance is quite good but food ruins it all..nothing much to say about this place. avvoid this guys please. They should improve the quality of the food.
 i would rate this as 0......"
"My one of the best place for food, 
Quality of Food is Awesome.....Service is Good and faster than any other restaurants in Dombivli....
our Dombivli Needs this type of place for party and see now we have all together i.e Good food + best service+ lovely interior & awesome music in Anna Kadai......
so i'l suggest like me be a regular visitor in ANNA KADAI......."
"One of the best ambience i have seen in any restaurant.
Food is great...you will find some peculiar south indian dishes here."
Nice place with good ambiance and sitting arrangement. Food is nice especially Non Veg also there are good options available for Vegetarians. Prices are also reasonable. In all a good place in dombivali. Must Visit
"Had rated them 5/5 in my previous review but i have modified it based on my recent take-away experience. They said their delivery boy wasn't available on that day, that being a public holiday and I agreed to take away food from there myself. After reaching home, when I opened the parcel containing naans, I found just one butter naan inside it while I had ordered for five. We had already finished eating the starters till then and had to leave the meal in between and collect the rest of the naans since their delivery guy wasn't available to do the same; in-spite of that being their fault. I am utterly disappointed with their delivery service.

Yesterday I was here with family. We tried veg food here. Its ok not so good. Want to try Non-veg.
"Good food, nice ambience .. in dombivli this ambience actually matters"
I was surprised to see a lounge kind of a place in dombivali. And the interiors are not so bad as I expected. Prices are cheaper than any other restaurant in mumbai. But it is in a very shady place. It has got a big scree..so good for watching Fifa. All in all I loved this place considering its in dombivali. Cheers.
"Excellent ambiance ..
OK food quality..
Service should have been better..
Over all - OK !"
good food... good interiors...
"A good place to hang out with your friends. Nice food, alcohol at reasonable rates. Good ambience. Value for money. Up to the mark of the so called 'Mumbai ambience'. Worth visiting at least once. Cheers!"
"Have been to this place a couple of times and its not at all a bad place. The food is great and quantity is also very reasonable. Prices are also justified. Liked the rasam which is given as a welcome drink. The chicken items are great. Seafood soup is a must try. The ambience is a
So very relaxed. It is a good place for people who want to drink. All in all value for money.
Service tends to get slow sometimes."
"You would not regret visiting this place. The food is quite tasty, esp non veg and even the ambience is a subtle one. A good combination to have a delightful dinner."
"Ambience is stunning . food is delicious specially south indian .i"" ve tried almost all the sea food here, its the best in Dombivli. n the service is appreciateable very attentive. its will be my first choice 4 a friends get 2gether @ Dombivli. Seriously we need more such restaurants .plenty of space 4 car parking as well."
Average place. A bit of a disappointment actually. Is a typical run of d mill eatery. Avoidable.
"Superb food...
goood ambience. .
dombivli need some more restaurant like dis."
Good Resturant in Dombivli but they will not be able to substain because of their choice of property in such disgusting area
"One of the best placed I have ever seen in dombivli. ...

"Anna Kadai :
Food : Quantity fits the price here! In soup loved the Dal Shorba & in starter Kaju Meti Rol..

Awesome food great music great interior... in all a rocking place :)
"Amazing Food! Amazing Food!! Amazing Food!!! Now that we have got that out of the way, the ambience is calming and cosy. Sections in the restaurant have ""baithak"" or Indian-style low-seating. The staff are very courteous, informed and have good suggestions for you. They are very attentive, yet ensure you get the privacy you need. Service was excellent. We had a lot of seafood which was fresh and cooked to perfection. Some recommendations include the Surmai Fry, Prawns tandoori, And Basa Rawa Fry. We also had Chicken Kudla (might be a bit spicy for some) but was an amazing chicken preparation. Last, but not the least, not to forget Chicken Ghee Roast. Divine Yumminess! :)...read more"
