Butter pav smelled and tasted like some cheap oil paav instead of butter paav.... the bhaaji was average in taste
the food is overpriced for the quality and quantity. There are far better restaurants than this. Roughly 2300 for 4 people without any discounts. 3 star hotels serve at this price.

tasteless food no spice no nothing just pure waste of â‚¹300
Too much costly.. not at all worth.. bhaji was not having salt.. the taste is average not upto the mark comparing to pricing.

"Food is good, nice staff. It's one of the oldest hotels in Thane, yet they've found ways to improve and renovate. Nice place to have food with family!"

"very very bad restaurant, the staff treated us very badly. Also they ignored us a couple of times when we asked for something. the food wasn't that great either"
Paneer was having a burn smell and Naan was very very hard and was like a normal naan without butter
Quality of the food should be improved
Medu vada tastes best from all restaurants in Thane. Idli and dairy vada was good.

"Not sure if their relatives have given these 4.5 ratings. The packing is substandard, taste is pathetic and prices for such horrible food is unbelievable. Never ordering again for such a substandard restaurant. Terrible experience"
Wonderful packing boss. Mazaa aagya
