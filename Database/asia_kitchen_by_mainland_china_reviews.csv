My request to not add chilli was ignored even though I called them up and again requested them and was verbally assured that it will be followed.
The food is highly overpriced. at this amount I would love to dine at Foo which is 100 times better
"We ordered Thai chicken, they send basil chicken"
"The food was absolutely rubbish. the rice had no salt or texture. was very soggy. Chicken also had no salt. extremely disappointing food. I have been a regular customer, but this was the first time the food was this bad."
Loud music. Can't have a normal conversation. Poor service. No water till you ask for it. No refill of empty bottle.

Am glad someone reads requests and acts on them. Got 2 tiny tastings of their sauces as requested. the discounted rates will make me taste more dishes in future.
Rice tasted spoilt. Bad experience.
"The taste & quality of the food is not what it used to be..
Thoroughly disappointed.
wi fi is available but was told it's not shared with guests??"
"Order delayed had to follow up with restaurant and Zomato support was horrible and had no idea how to manage had not idea where is order .. I called the restaurant and rider and got it delivered, thanks to delivery guy he was at least sensible to manage"
Rice was very very spicy.not edible
I got veg rice in place of mixed meat rice.
"i had ordered chicken sizzler
No way the dish tasted or looked like a sizzler
It was mere rice with nothing, just a cup of gravy and two small pieces of lollipop
The quality and quantity both lacked for the exorbitant price of the dish being charged ,it was similar to any chicken rice with gravy,even that does have chicken in the rice but this was just plain rice.
It was a total waste of money and time."
"Paneer was stinking while eating!
Left the food in bin!
Horrible food taste and quality this time"
This time the visit was not very satisfactory. The sushi ordered was just 4 small circles served for 500+ Rs and even the chilli garlic noodles ordered had a very unpleasant taste to it. Although smoked paneer was amazing and spicy but dint find Rs 550 minimum to be spent on 4 pieces of tiny sushi which was shocking was waste of money.
Food was different but good. Service was good.
""
Very poor food which is overpriced and the service is extremely slow and bad
NO DISCOUNT
"this is only for delivery experience, the soup was delivered so late. we order from here because it's too close to our building, soup order took more than an hour to be delivered"

Bad service and very bad food.
"Really bad. I‚Äôve had it earlier as well from their restaurant and it was always good. But this time it was poorly done. The roll had too much rice, rolled very loosely, and felt like I was eating at a random sushi place. Never ordering again them."

well made. just chicken need to be fresh it would have been better
I gave clear instructions for the chicken gravy to be less spicy it‚Äôs extremely spicy still. I need some compensation for this.

"Went to Asia Kitchen after a long break, was a regular visitor earlier. Taste and service is still good as before but prices and portion sizes have changed and on wrong side if you are a customer. Still a great place for Asian cuisine."

"I recently ordered pan fried noodles and fish, the fish was undercooked with no salt and the noodles were almost burnt. This is highly disappointing. When I called customer care they said they can‚Äôt do anything. Zomato has been really unhelpful. But more than that Asia kitchen where I order from almost every week, has failed me. Will reconsider ordering in future"
