overall loved the food once again. all dishes were good and instructions followed to make less spicy and zero spice for some of the dishes. only chicken lollypop was spicy so expect hotel to take care of the instruction or call for any exceptions. otherwise food quality and portion was good. this time ordered for some guests and their kids Nd they loved the food
I had mention Jain n received non Jain n mushroom in it .

"Parathas were a complete let down
packages had spillage. could have been better.
Rest all items were fairly good .
Kashmiri Dum Aloo was good."

Not worth even half the price of my almost 2K bill taste wise. Also the food was delivered absolutely cold.

"Butter chicken was very delicious
Butter Nan hard and less Butter"

"I had ordered 2 biryani but the hotel only delivered 1, on calling the restaurant they told me to order one more biryani and said that they'll pay the zomato delivery person, when the delivery guy came on my doorstep they hotel refused from paying it and also stopped taking any calls, we had to wait 2 hours to get our correct order and even on getting the order, the restaurant denied about this entire incident putting the delivery guy in a position to make payment on behalf of them
very unprofessional behaviour from the restaurant"

The food was cold that it cannot be eaten
"Mediocre food at its best!
Rude staff, overpriced food and extremely delayed service.
We went in around 9:30 pm and left around 12.
4 soups and 2 starters arrived after 45 minutes, when asked about the delay the staff started arguing that ""we have a lot of people, but the kitchen is not preparing the food quickly"". After understanding the delay in service we ordered the main course while the starters arrived. One gravy with 4 roti and rice that also took around 45-50 minutes!!! We had to take the rice parcel as it was getting late to go home and frankly I had no intention of waiting there for one more second!
And the height of all the waiter came behind us after the billing...read more"

Mutton was not at all cooked . It was Just like chewing gum
"ordered once again from Atithi and loved the food. if you or your kids don't want too much spicy then this place is good. I had specifically asked for veg hakka noodles to be zero spice and happy that the instruction was followed. mutton Rogan Josh is good though felt little oily, but no complaints as such as I liked the overall flavour. overall food was good and I will continue to order from here."

"plain roti was chewy and hard to eat
chicken ghee roast could have been more better but it's ok"

tandoori chicken was not at all cooked
"Instead of Jeera rice, plain rice was delivered"
"overall food quality was good as usual. my kids love the food here as it's little non spicy. mutton bhuna, lazeez sabzi , surmai fish and golden prawns were awesome. we found prawns rawa fry dry but that's actually expected so no issue with the restaurant but we will order something else next time. mushroom rasbhari was ok but mushroom pesto was better in my opinion. paneer kurkure was dry and tasteless. lesson learnt for butter roti, since it takes lot of time for delivery to my place usually it becomes less hot and rubbery , I am definitely skipping next time. overall good experience though, I will order something else from here next time and comment on the experience."

"Restaurant never sends cutlery. Also, despite cooking instructions, excess oil is used while cooking."
""
"Although the food was tasty, The restaurant took a lot of time to prepare the order almost close to 2 hours. hence will not recommend ordering from the place atleast on festival days because they clearly seem to be under prepared when pressure of large orders comes up."
