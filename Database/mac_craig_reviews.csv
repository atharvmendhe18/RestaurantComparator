I gave less rating to chicken burger because it had green chilli pieces. Nobody on this planet puts green chillies inside a chicken burger. It should be stopped right away. I won't order it again.

"All the items were tasty, yummy, lip smacking.
Items were missing, had ordered
3 Caramel custard, recd. only 2;
Almond Madeira Cake ordered was not received, was looking forward to taste the cake since a long time.
The caramel custard tasted subtle, it was tasty, if sweetness could be increased it would be fab.
Packing can be improved.
Until the nxt. order."

"this is an old place in bandra. the lollipops though gd in flapur had a red which was very unappealing
the manchurian roll.though gd was tad dry
the chicken pie and the chicken puff are the same. exactly the same and are both unflavored.
the somosas were alright and so were the cheese lollipops"
