"very bad food, both items actually went to the dustbin. The chicken koliwada was chewy n was made with bad quality chicken and the achari kabab was completely bitter ,the entire order went to the dustbin.I don't know how this restaurant has 4 rating looks like most of the ratings are paid. This was my first and last order from Mamata restaurant and i will also be submitting a review on Google and my experience"

"Today I found one of the Most Pocket Friendly Family Restaurant & Bar in The Costly City Navi Mumbai.
My Ordered Items were @tuborg Beer 650ml Rs- 260/-
&
Roasted Mutton Full Rs- 700/-
Just Look at The Quantity of The Mutton what They surved 20 pieces in Full Plate.
Taste was good and it was value for money.

Food Quality: 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5"
