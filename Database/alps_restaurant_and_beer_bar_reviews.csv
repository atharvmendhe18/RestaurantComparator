Review
"To all Beer lovers this is the place where you should check for sure,more than indians you will find more foreigners here Chicken sandwich is the best thing that i have tasted"
The best place to have a beer. It's dead cheap and chilled. We ordered Crispy chicken and didn't particularly like it. Its probably the best place to chill out at any day. The ambience is good and staff is friendly.
"Yet another classic restaurants from the South. Totally in love with the simple and surreal vibe this cafe has.
Quality of food here is undoubtedly on point.
Mostly known for their Fish n Chips and Sizzlers, we tried their Chicken Stake Sizzler and it was lipsmacking.
We also tried their Cheese Burger and Jalapeno Pockets both being very well prepared and served.
A place where you see time passing by with old school english classic music playing and a beer to sip.
Favourite place again!!"
"Worst experience ever, the manager of the restaurant is impolite and really doesn't know how to value customers, manager was shouting and misbehaving with the customers."
"Very nice place. Quiet ambience. Had sizzler chicken steak and bhurji pav. One of the best that I've had in Mumbai.
If u are near Gateway, do step in"
"Located near the famous Bademiya and Gokul, this is a good option to quietly enjoy some beer and port wine.
The Alps unfortunately has only beer and wine, so anyone looking for hard drinks will have to choose from the many options around.
The food menu is very limited here. I liked the Hummus but the pork sausage was average.
All in all a decent place if you want to get away from all the noise in Colaba and enjoy your drinks in peace."
"Located at colaba causway in next lane of Gokul. This place looks oldie as soon as you enter, but it serves great beer and food that too in your budget.

I ordered hummus and chicken steak sizzlers

Hummus- It was well samsehed and prepared, while bread too was fresh and soft topped with olives and a bit spices which makes it interesting. Having this with their available tap beers is simply good.

Chicken steak sizzlers- I must say it was delicious, chicken was tender and we'll marinated.

Quality- good
Quantity- enough for two
Recommended- yes!!"
Alps was on my list for a long time only because it looked so charming and rustic and it didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. The ambience is great and very old school. The Sticky Chicken Wings were decent and so is the service. The place needs to take care of the hygiene though.
"Yet another iconic place at an even more iconic locality . The best thing I liked about this place is its interior . Has a subtle old world charm , reminiscent of the British era , not much has changed with time , one can sit back and enjoy ones own private time with friends . About the food I must say the quality of the chicken and fish used is excellent and absolutely trustworthy. A must visit place overall . üëç"
"It was a busy sunny afternoon after college when I planned to visit colaba. I was hungry and I don't know all of a sudden I felt like entering this place. Its not right front but isolated from chaos which made me wanna visit it. I already knew what I had to try, their fish and chips with a good port wine.
Now being a proper Desi foodie, I critiqued it hard on the spices but if you love the subtle flavors, you'll enjoy the fish alot."
Lovely place and ambience... But just a beer bar and port wine.. Great place to go with friends for some beers.. They don't have smoking section though..
"I had experienced one of the worst service and the taste of the food ever in my life ..please do not ever step into this restaurant.
It‚Äôs Pathetic."
Great place with a nice ambiance and amazing food!! üòçüòã The service was prompt and it‚Äôs a happy place to spend time with your loved ones!! Worth a visit. üëç
"Has been to this place twice. They never dispappointed.
Small place but lovely one. I love thier snacks and appetizers. It gels well with a mug of beer . Must try once you are around Taj."
Get ready to be transported back in time a few decades ago when you step in. Once the door closes you feel like a gangster from the 70s hatching a plan over a chilled beer and sausages. Time does seem to go by slowly here and you just never feel rushed. The highly recommended chicken sizzler seemed a bit disappointing at first but you start liking it with every bite.
"Apls is on Mereweather road which is just behind Taj Mahal Hotel. On 5th Dec 2018, I was the first person to enter the restaurant for my early lunch at about 1230 hrs. The place looks like Irani restaurant with mirrors all around the wall and typical wooden furniture. As suggested by server, opted for Chilly Chicken and chicken fried rice which is turned out to be good in taste and portion.

I am sure the place turns good in the evening hours for beer and more !"
"I was supposed to visit another restaurant when we found this #Beercafe... Trust me this place is a classic example of Bistro. You actually experience the South-bombay style.
You have varied options for snacks and beers&wines too. It has fast service and very kind stewards.
*Offer on Carlsberg beer * subjected to change"
Horrible to the core! This is what they called steak sizzler! Shitty because they‚Äôve been cheated by the butcher who has given them chicken pieces instead of steaks
"Growing up on the street of colaba this vintage place back side of Taj Mahal hotel gives u peace to your soul...stop over before going to bade miya for food they serve u extremely chill beer.hands down chicken sandwich and amazing amazing chilli chicken and this brings so much positive and nice vibes in you....finally this place is too sober and u don‚Äôt find much crowed in week days all in all if you need some peace and good conversation with friends then this is the place...

Food - 7.5/10
Ambience - 6/10
Service - 8/10


Visit with friends for long chats....I don‚Äôt expect this to change as kuch toh vintage rahne do"
"Found this place on zomato and was really looking forward to go to this place. Located in the bylanes of colaba and just behind the Taj, it is a good place for a change from other known eateries.
The ambience is really really good and the music complements the decor of this place, gives a very classic American vibes. The staff are really kind but not so friendly.
Coming to food, we had ordered nachos. It did not turn out well and was not even close to what nachos taste like. We had also ordered fish and chips. The fish was well cooked - soft and buttery. The fries were decent.
Overall a good place for chilling out."
"The best place ever if you are a Sizzler lover. Veg sizzler will cost you Rs.350 and non veg is of Rs.400.
Quantity is good as well.

Just love the place,food,ambience everytime I go.

Highly recommended"
"Lovely food, within budget and beautiful ambiance ......loved the taste of the food, staffs are polite and service is good. Free wifi is there and beer,wine is available too. In short worthy place to have lovely dinner."
"The ambience is freaking good. That's the only good thing I'd say. We ordered schezwan rice and nachos.
Food was okay. Nachos was freaking disgusting. Never go for nachos here. Overall average experience."
"I have been to Alps twice. I love this place. The ambience is great and this place has really good vibes. We ordered for a few beers, Veg Sizzler, Cheesy French Fries and Chicken Sizzler. All these dishes were lip smacking. Service was fantastic. It's embarrassing that I don't know the name of our server, he was polite and quick. I love this place for its ambience, vibes and food. Amazing place to chill with friends, family or just by yourself.

You gotta visit this place if you are in Colaba."
"Located in the beautiful by-lanes of Colaba, Alps is a very good place to hang out and have a few beers. They have good offers on most days and the service is good too. Had the jalape√±os-cheese poppers and the paneer Tikka. Both had good flavors. The ambience is decent."
"Alps is a chilled out restaurant located exactly behind the Taj Mahal Palace in colaba. With its relaxed vibe and appetizing menu, this is place is exactly where to kick-start the good times on a Sunday.
So we had the sizzling Paneer Chilly Gravy and Chicken Fried Rice.

The Paneer Chilly Gravy is served with a good amount of garlic onion, capsicum and chilli dressing followed by lovely chunks of paneer doused in an equally dazzling gravy.

The fried rice is an all time classic and is almost always on point, what makes the Alps experience great is the sheer quantity they serve.

To wash down this dynamic duo we have a pint of Kingfisher and a mug of draught beer.
The Mug of beer was on...read more"
Today 1st July Sun Noon..myself and family visited the Cool place...very old joint..They Serve only Beer and Wine... Its nice place to have cool quite funnnn...Service is friendly..We had couple of Kingfisher and Tuborg beer..Alongwith Beer we had Cheesy Nachos ..Cheesy Fries...Sausages...Chiken Steak....Food was yummy..We spent around 5 hrs in this place...We enjoyed...Wl definately visit again.
"We went here with a group of friends and the experience was awesome. The restaurant is located in a very prominent location in Colaba and it has been there for many years now.

We have tried the Pork Sausage and Chips which was absolutely mind blowing. We also tried the Chicken Club Sandwich. It was very rich & filling. We also ordered for the Chicken Steak Sizzler. Again very good taste and decent portion size.

All in all a very memorable evening :)"
"After 30 mins I was wondering why did I end up here...it felt like a self ""service bar"", food is extremely high priced for the quality of service. The 2 stars are for the chilled BEER"
Great place to sit and chat if in the area. Affordable and affable. Way better than Gokul or mondegar. Have had sausage and chips. Very good.
"Let's break it down Ambience: Very warm and welcoming feel to the overall place. Just the right mix of old school blended with a pinch of contemporary decor. Food: THe chicken sizzler with Spaghetti was an A-Class. Really wanted to try the mixed-grill sizzler. Wasn't a big fan of the cheese french fries. But then I loved this place.Service: Prompt, Polite and Fast. Definitely, a gem that I discovered."
"Amazing food(fish and chips & chicken chilly - must try), different atmosphere and most important thing is please keep your restroom clean and hygenic. #Basics"
"Located behind the Taj hotel at colaba, this place serves beer and wine and some lovely starters.
Ordered a bottle of red wine, which was very fine.
Also ordered a couple of beers.
Starters were good, cheesy french fries, chicken crispy.
Both the starters were well made.
Coming to the ambience, it is simple and cozy.
Pricing is very reasonable.
Service is good and the staff is very Polite and gave good recommendation.
Overall was a good time."
"Absolutely no service, plus average food, and to top it off they charge you 80rs for a 20rs beverage bottle. Not recommended unless you want to waste your money."
"On a hot day, we decided to have beer & needed a shelter after shopping get done from causeway.

Hoped into this place.
I have been here before many times but this was the time I decided to write a good review.

Location-
Situated just behind the Taj hotel.
In the colaba causeway area.

Ambiance-
I like that european feel. Even outside, you have a feel of it.
Plants on the roof, the entrance door is like a booth you want to enter.
Cozy & Feels good. It's a perfect beer bar id say.
Hanging big lantern lights. Posters on the wall.
Comfy table chairs.

Food -
Hummus & Pita
An ordinary, regular hummus. Pita was a bit thick.
They have Bira.
Fish & Chips are good.

Staff -
Cannot comment....read more"
"Ok so whoever likes flashy places,this place ain't for you! This is an old school cafe where there are regular dishes and regular alcohol! But that's the catch, old school nostalgia, chill & calm! No nonsense menu, quick service, match on the TV and same old routine conversation with frnz.. I could totally be at peace in middle of bustling colaba causewy!! My type of place, nothing that I would like to change about the restoüòÄ"
"Chill place. Popular with the locals. Cool vibe for a pint and some old school snacks and music. Peanuts, chips and masala papad went very well with the Bira white. Good place for groups as well."
"Just average as far as the food is concerned. The ambience, however, is wonderful. The staff is cold and indifferent. Dont expect a wide spread of food items as options."
"9/10 to B.B.Q. chicken
8/10 to Sizzlers
7/10 service
A good place to dine out on a cozy weekday .
Feel free to go if you want to skip Indian meal.

P.s. A beer & sticky chicken wings I always prefer in Alps"
"Good vibe. Good place to chill. Enjoyed the chicken club sandwich with a pint of beer. Made me feel I was in goa the moment I entered.
Must visit."
"Tonight was my uncountable visit to Alps again & one of my dear friends decided to pin it as her birthday-celebrating venue. I would like to owe a big thank you to Alps for allowing my friend to cut her birthday cake & play a birthday song. I love this place & would recommend everyone (who love drinking beer) to visit it atleast once. The best combo to have is beer & sausages (either pork or chicken) with chips on the side.
The only drawback is, the kitchen shuts at 11:00pm & even the guests aren't allowed since then. (so if you're lucky to be seated inside, you can finish your pint or pitcher by midnight & disperse)"
"Go here for a calm glass of beer with friends. Such an apt place to drink, eat and talk. They serve amazing Chicken Burger and Chicken Sandwich. Love the vibe here."
Great place for a beer and fast food and to chill with friends.. Food here is good but could be better..we went there in search of beer and found pretty good menu for starters and finger food as well..!!
"Went to this place on the night of 30th December. Place is decent with nice ambiance. We ordered one pitcher of draught beer, fish and chips and chicken sausage and fries. All the foods were quite good specially the fish. It's fresh. Location is also very much convenient. Overall nice place with Budget."
"If you are looking for peaceful place to have a good conversation over a beer or wine, this place won't disappoint you. Located just behind Leopold in the bylanes of Colaba, this cafe is easy to find and pocket friendly. Limited menu, not much to choose from, we ordered chicken crispy which was decent in terms of both quality and quantity.

Food : 3.5/5

Service : 4/5

Ambiance : 3.5/5"
Not very good food. Altough interior is kind of nice but sizzler didn't taste good at all which is the speciality dish of the restraunt and thus I would say not a money worth.
"To do chill out on Sunday evening with chilled beer üç∫ ,,, nice and caffe type ambiance... server was very active ,, when you finished your beer or empty glass he will refill in that moment ... not a big menu but you can order some snacks .... overall it‚Äôs koooolll place ,,, to chill out ....."
"A good old school restaurant and bar around colaba .. small limited menu but good food !
It gives you the rustic colaba feel with old furniture and ambiance ..
Chicken chilly a must try!

Food : 3.5/5

Service : 3.5

Ambiance : 3/5"
"This place has this rusty looks and dim lights, dey serve cold beer and wine which goes wth the place.. BBQ chicken wings and sizzlers are A, fish and chips nt dat great."
"Never ever going back here. The service is reluctant, food is pathetic and they don't even have a proper menu card. It's more like a drinks only place and not a restaurant."
"Me with my peeps who always love to try some new places to hangout... went here.

It' s really ok ok place... if you want to EAT!
It have good ambiance! Wine and Liquors... but food was not so good.

We ordered nachos and Sizzlers .. in food menu. Which was Really not upto mark! That was only drawback else it's good place to hang out and booz.."
Great to hop in for some beers and snacks at a reasonable rate. The place is quite simple and enjoyable. Overall a decent place to grab a bite and drink.
"Not everyone would like this place. But I have been going here since 1998. The place has seldom changed. Same wooden chairs, wall to wall mirror on the right side of the entrance. Dimly lit interior. Small, crisp menu. All in all nothing changed.

We always frequented this place for beer/s and finger food. Last week it was the same. Just beer and finger food.

Always a delight to revisit old 'dens', which are also pocket friendly. For us, four beers and 2 snacks set us back by 874/- including all applicable taxes. That was damn cool for us."
"Food ( 3 )
Ambiance ( 3.5 )
Service ( 3 )
VFM ( 3.5 )

A decent place to try when other more famous neighbourhood joint are busy.
Excellent location; properly priced decent spread of food nd drink"
"Easy to find. Service is slow. Food is good. Rusty vintage feel when you enter.

What I ordered:-
Mexican chilli fries, non veg sizzlers, jalape√±o poppers and red wine (Santa Cruz)"
"Great food, amazing ambience! Perfect for beer and chill!!
What I ordered: -Chicken sausage and chips
-Chicken steak sizzler
The fries here are real good."
Pus update the menu card as it was not the same as to what I seen when I entered .... Had very few items compared to what's shown ..... It's more of a bar now then a restaurant
A great place if you want to have a sizzlers with a glass of beer. You don't t have too many options but you can try the nonveg mixed grill. Small place just few tables to sit and chill. If you are planning to go out with a big group please have the place booked before hand as this place is never empty. The service is slow and takes a little longer time to serve. Who cares when you have great food and beer. A must 1time visit to this place
"If u are beer lover then should visit this place ...place is peaceful and very relaxing, ambiance is ok cost of beer is reasonable, starters are good specially chicken chili.2 650ml and 1 pint for 700 most of the time they have this offer.quick service"
"Over priced food. The quantity of food offered is not much and the taste is not that great. In fact the food tasted stale. We ordered the sizzlers with pork Sausages which cost rs 500! You can get better tasting sizzlers at other places within rs 350. The pork sausages tasted stale and were not fresh. If you are paying a premium I would expect fresh food from the restaurant. The beer served was not chill, just mildly cold. I pointed this out to the waiter who smiled and said that's the maximum it can be chilled!? The waiter couldn't even understand basic English. I had to speak in hindi to him. Not that I mind but the restaurant seems to have a goan setting and if the waiter can't even...read more"
"Perfect food, had some mix non veg sizzling sizzler, & fish & chips. Good beer & Great music (uncannily played a well loved 90s playlist while it was a evening with a bff dating to the 90s)."
"I visit this place quite often when planning for a drink or two, especially when I'm on a budget. A cozy place with good service and lovely music. It's situated in one of the lanes at Colaba causeway (the lane right after Citywalk showroom). The menu is limited with not much variation. The Jalapeno poppers, Pork Sausage and Chips, BBQ sticky wings and Chilli cheese toast are some of the dishes I'd recommend. A very pocket friendly place situated in the hub of the city. A place I'd recommend if you want to spend some good time when catching up on old friends for some snacks, drinks, and old school chatter."
"This is a perfect place for draught beer lovers. The beer is crisp and taste very good. Quiet place to meet and have a good conversation. You get one of tastiest steaks and sizzlers. If you are draught beer lover, this is a must place to visit."
"Located in a small yet uptown corner just behind the Taj Hotel. The ambience is cozy and comfortable.
The chairs could be better on comfort but again the retro feel is good here.

Coming to the food - they have fresh food and spicy curries.
The chicken burger is a good try.
The patty is really good and makes for a good start.
What is good is it is served with a dash of wafers that go along well.

Masala Omelette is good.

Wine ! Yes one of the main reason to go here.
They have a decent collection of them from santacruz port to nashik sula.

Very Very pocket friendly.
Would go here for a decent meal and wine in the bylanes of colaba."
"Located in South Mumbai and nicely decorated place to hangout or spend some time with your friends.
Usually less crowded so if you have some gadget based work you can surely barged in.
It looks nice the working and busy Mumbai through a transparent glass and having a sip of beer.
Interior is nice. Some uniques things like hanging table lamps etc. Its very mild interior so one can spend good time here.
My review would be limited about the food as in the evening time I could not order many dishes.
They served nice cocktails with beer that I like and would like to recommend as well.
One of the drink the flavour was slightly more.
But they have many colourful beer mixtures and are good...read more"
"The 3.5 rating is not because of the quality of food or service which is rather.. average. Where this place actually shines is the ambiance and VFM menu. The place feels like an old vintage bar and can be very relaxing. It lacks the bling of other restaurants/bars in the vicinity but not in a bad way. They only serve beer and wine so keep that in mind while going here. Finally this is a very good choice if VFM is a priority.

"Just go there to chill. If you know what I mean. Can try the Fish and Chips if you want to. A pitcher of regular draught beer to go with. If you wish to stay away from BS for a while, go chill at Alps"
"There is my personal list of places which I WONT VIST IN FUTURE, and this place has successfully secured the place with flying colours.

Such a tremendous location but the place lacks every bit of it. I ordered a grilled sandwich with a bottle of beer. It was one of the worst sandwich ever went inside my mouth. I mean for 100 bucks with tax and they only had cucumber tomato and cheese to fill in.

Next was the waiter he out ruled my every choice on the menu by saying its not good in taste or its not available.

The place has descent Interior which may give one a feel of pseudo European restaurant. But the food and staff lacks every bit of it."
"A pocket friendly drinking option in one of the most happening neighbourhoods in the city.
It is easier to spot if you are walking around the area behind Taj hotel.
Twice I have visited this place. Second time I went there because the first was a little disappointing, I wanted to give one more chance and this review is based on both being considered.
They have not put much effort in making food very attractive, there's no compromise with the taste. Sizzlers are average even though they have displayed all over the place that they are famous for it. I have had better.
Fish and chips is a must try which goes along fine with beer or wine which is a boost to the mood.
Cheesy French fries are...read more"
"Happened to visit this place recently with a friend, after hearing a lot of positive descriptions. The place was empty at 6 in the evening when we paid the place a visit for a bite.

While the Mexican fries turned out to be worth every penny, the Chicken Club Sandwich turned out to be an average fare. Wouldn't give the establishment a negative rating until I've tried a few more dishes here.

What I really liked about the place was the ambience -- which had the look and feel of a diner, and I for once really enjoyed my beer. With the faint sound of country music in the background, it looked exactly like the place where I would want to unwind after a long day's work.

Looking forward to...read more"
"Great place to hang out for hours and meet your friends and spend time.
Its on the narrow street of Colaba; very famous for fish and chips , sandwhich ."
"Me and a friend went to this place the last week. Main attraction was the sign on the door that said a pint free with two large beer bottles! The food is quite fine, not the superb kind, but fine, thats all. The pork didnt taste like pork though. Fish and chips are okayish. The sizzler was filling! What was satisfying was the chilled beer and the ambiance! The quite and calm ambiance! It was blissfully peaceful and we loved it. We had a lot to catch up on and there was no rush at all!
I will recommend this place for the peaceful ambiance that it provides, while the food can definitely improve and be a bit more affordable."
"It's nice little place located behind Taj hotel offering sizzlers and beers. Chicken burger and cheese poppers were good. Fish n chips was average.

It has a typical Goan feel to it. Very quiet n laid back place where one can chill out."
"Situated in a corner of the Naoroji Furdunji lane, avoiding all the hustle and the bustle of the Colaba Causeway. Me and my couple of friends after glancing their reviews on zomato decided to get in and have couple of beers and a bite to eat. The ambience is decent and quiet which was an add on. Ordered Chicken Crispy and BBQ Sticky Wings, both disappointed me with the quality and the quantity of the dish. Service was poor and had to call-out the attender( who was BTW totally disinterested) again and again to get the status on the order. Personally I felt the prices are ridiculously expensive here and will never step in again and warn others too. Ruined my Sunday afternoon. Disappointed!"
"What you will first notice besides my awesome T-shirt (in the pics), is that their menu says all tax inclusive !! Now can u imagine what a relief that is for someone like me who thinks 150 rs ka pint pe kitna tax lagega yahaan :P ?

Located at #Colaba, closeby to #Baghdadi and #Gokul.. this place makes for a pocket friendly drinking place in town. Although  I didnt try the food here.. I've read their sizzlers are pretty good. The ambiance is decent with limited sitting arrangements, however gives a good vibe. Id recommend this place for a quick beer / glass of wine / grab a bite (read some good reviews abt their burgers too)

 Anyhoo .. enjoy your weekend!! cheers"
"Lovely place if you want some quiet time by yourself also, especially from the hustle bustle of colaba causeway, it's in the Leopoldo lane.

It started in 1976 and perfect to go and get yourself a chilled beer.

We were hungry too so order for Chicken shzewan rice which is good for 2 people, the taste was good and had small chicken pieces instead of chunks, after that we ordered for pork sausage and fries, the marinade was good pork cut in small pieces, not cooked in Goan style but worth the money.

So go ahead and try it."
"If you want a quiet place with decent music, VFM food and beer go here! Screams vintage and a Friendly staff makes it good place to relax and have a conversation and it's stone's throw away from Gokul, Baghdadi etc"
Great food. One of the old bars.... highly reasonable. Only one of the bald waiter is too rude. That's the only negative part. Other guys are very decent and polite.
"No load music, no load mouth peeps, so basically if you want to enjoy your beer and novel in peace and also if you have a budget constraint, then this is the place."
Alps is an old restaurant in an old building in the Colaba area just behind the Taj Mahal hotel. It is famous for it's Sizzlers so we tried out their non vegetarian Sizzler which included chicken and pork sausages and chunks of chicken meat along with vegetables and mashed potatoes and a choice of noodles or rice. The chicken was well done and though the pork sausages were a bit small they tasted good. A bit high on the price but large enough portions good enough for two.
"Classic on the list! Affordable liquor with tasty food and old but classic ambience is what I can say for Alps. Came across this via blog on google and thought of trying it on Sunday Afternoon. Luckily I found myself a good table. It's proximity to Gokul and Baghdadi make it m popular among the youngsters but it's a small place of all! I ll suggest to be before time to grab yourself a comfy corner. They have limited staff and limited options on the menu but I still like the place for its ambience, location and never the less tasty sizzlers!

Taste - 4.5/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 4/5"
Limited item on the menu but good food. It's a small place near Colaba Causeway. Drinks are pretty cheap compared to other restaurants in vicinity.  The Veg Sizzler and Burger is quite tasty.
"I was always finicky about visiting Alps despite it being so close to home, but I'm so glad I overcame that! Amazing atmosphere, makes one feel really relaxed, great service and yummy sizzlers! Looks like its going to be my new adda hahah!"
"We were just crossing from that lane and saw Alps Restaurant written along with Beer Bar, Sizzler, Fish & Chips board. Out of curiosity we went in. It was a small place and we could be a lot of tourist there. This place has limited food option but cheap liquor for sure. The food quantity is very good. I ordered Veg Sizzler with noodles and it was quite good. We all enjoyed wine and beer. Friends ate Non Veg Sizzler with rice and chilli chicken which they said was delicious. Overall good time spent."
"Landed here after finding it feature in the top ' low cost ' must-visit drinking holes of mumbai list.
My verdict - surely a must-visit place.
Location is perfect, prices are actually in the mid range, ambience is to die for (quaint and takes you back in time - hence provides a very different experience).
We called for a bottle of red wine (500‚Çπ), masala papad (50‚Çπ) and some amazing chilly chicken (250‚Çπ). The chilly chicken was the star dish - good portion and surprisingly tasty. We spent 3 hours here and witnessed all kinds of people coming in and having a nice time - teenagers, families having full course meals, firangs for a pint of beer, business associates etc. Service is...read more"
