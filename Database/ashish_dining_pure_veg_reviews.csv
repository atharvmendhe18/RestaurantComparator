"Whenever we are not in a mood of cooking at home or wasn‚Äôt able to look due to situation our heads turn towards Ashish Dining for a food looked in homely condition.
The food taste is just like the food we cooked at home and it gives a feeling of security."

"I went here for my lunch with office colleges it's a very average restaurant but the variety they have in vegetarian food my God.

We ordered -
1) Pav Bhaji - it was very buttery and the pav was very soft. (5/5)
2) Veg manchurian - It was also very nice they served 6 pieces and the taste was mouth watering. (5/5).

I would say it‚Äôs very pocket friendly vegetarian option on ghodbunder road.

So if you prefer vegetarian food and looking some variety of options then ashish dining is a must try."
"Place is nice
Food is also nice
But the cost are high compare to thequality of food
Also the services are not that well
So overall experience is not that well"
"Ashish dining is a pocket friendly restaurant. If you are looking for some great food but empty pockets, you must visit or order from this place.

Food I have tried here:
Idli Sambar
Medu Wada Sambar
Dal Khichdi
Thali
Pav Bhaji
Biryani
Chinese

Overall:
Food quality: 5/5
Service : 4/5
Hygenic: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Food Delivery: 4/5"
"Ashish Dining is located near my work.  It is a decent place for ordering vegetarian dishes at our office.

We also order food from here for any seminar or special gathering.  

They cater different dishes.  We have tried with South Indian dishes and those were very delicious. 

They have also supplied Veg Thaali and I am happy with their food quality and service.

They lo make awesome Daal-khichdi and one must try out it out.

I rate them 4.0 in a scale of 5.0"
"Dont order tawa mushroom biryani/pulao, They end up giving u panner pulao!!!!
Paneer, looked stealed as it was weird in taste.
Was too hungry to return.

Wish you could do something about it

Silly Sad!!!!"
Not tasty...
taste is very bad
"Worst restaurant for delivery service. I had 4 times bad experience. Sends incomplete order, wrong items, late delivery after an hour, uncooked food..."
"Veg manchurian was half cook, Alu mutter was horrible."
Worst experience today I ordered from 1 pm but still now it is 4.30 not yet comming they don't have any responsibility if I am asking to conform they can't. Very irresponsible
"worst experience ever. food was really dangerous. roti was really a thick papad stone as well as veggies. no onions as well and no sauce for noodles. Unhappy with services ,,üò¢"
horrible fooda
Good size dosa. Order full dosa only if you are very hungry otherwise 1 dosa for two is enough for light meal. A regular veg kind of outlet where you can give order if not looking for any great time and just want to fill your tummy.
"delicious, delivered fast"
"right on tine, great service"
A very basic place. The Ambience is ok hence i mostly order the food from here. The taste is good. At times the delivery is slow maybe due to the weekend.
Excellent service and food
"This is a pocket friendly restaurant.
This restaurant has a quick delivery service which I experienced both when while dinning in restaurant and and when you ordered it at home.
The food tasts good."
the bhaji was quite dry
not good quality of paneer/Manchurian
They delivered chapatis instead of Puri. I have mentioned it in the order .
okay
Good
Good quantity and quality. Kudo's team as always...
Very worst quality of taste
food quality & quantity was good but the delivery was too delayed.
ok
Food served without salt.
"Third grade food, only salt.Worst than road side.Waste of money.Such restaurant should be deleted from your site."
Food quality before it was good but recently i order online from zomato triple fried rice. Quality of food was very bad. Taste was very bad.
Tasteless food
Pulao thali was just ok. Instead of quantity of item care should be given towards its quality and taste. kheer was uncooked. pulao was good but was not extremely tasty . Dals and veggies were not at all tasty. I would suggest rather than keeping so many keep one dal and veggie but it should be simple with less but healty oil yet tasty n fulfilling.
"They have made some drastic changes & now its more than fantastic! The food is just toooooo good! Try nargisi kofta, lassoni sabzi, amritsari.
Their punjabi items are really awesome!"
"nice service...,‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç"
"Ordered dal tadka (which was very tasty...a little less oil would have been better)
Tandoori roti(good)
Sambhar wada which was good though I prefer my sambhar to not be sweet
Rawa dosa which was good .

What I found was there was a difference in rates stated on zomato and actual bill sent with the meal.
Wonder why!!"
The food is good as per the price . They should really improve and work on their ambience . It would be a good option for home delivery as the seating arrangement is not really great .
"Have a thali for family, food was awesome. Place look small from entrance but food and service is really good. Quality and cost wise this place is good compare to other big hotels nearby..."
good food as always
roti naan need too much improvements...
delivery not proper
Pathetic. I ordered a Thali and they did not deliver the rice only. Be ready for an incomplete meal before ordering.
I would suggest a big NOOOO for this option.. Food quality pathetic.. If you are ordering online.. Please make your substitue option open.. Do Not rely on the delivery time and either if it's going to get deliver or not.. Totally unprofessional.. You will get a confirmation call after an hour of your expected delivery time.. None of their provided contact numbers are reachable... NO NO NO...
Very nice south Indian foods like idli/wada/dosa prompt delivery extremely reasonable prices and very nice quality makes this place awesome I for one especially love their idlis and dosas
"Don't order Dal khichdi with them,they just mix dal with rice and deliver..Bad experience,Also taste not so good.
So guys it's goona be Dal Chawal ,not khichdi exactly."
Very poor service. They delivered my order after 2 hours. Taste was also insipid.......................... .................................
"Aashish Dining is a regular veg restaurant at Anand nagar near Wine & Dine bar and restaurant. It is not easily visible from the road as its front entrance is small, in poor condition and its board difficult to spot. It is basically a veg restaurant specializing in south Indian foods. I have been to thus place about 10 times and what I like is the taste is consistent all the time. I usually order the range of dosas they have and almost all of them are of good authentic taste. The tea and coffee are just too good. I always end up ordering one more cup. Overall, they make some of the best dosas you can get. Definitely worth a go if you like dosas with tea or coffee. Avoid the AC...read more"
Extremely poor service particularly delivery... don't want to rate it even..Hope they improve it in future..
Worst hotel to order if you are in need of good food. Delivery time is horrible on top of that the manager is too rude to complain about delivery. You must know how much time it will take to order food is the his answer.
"Quality of food was good but guess how it will taste if your food item does not contain SALT. Chole in the chole-bhature without salt...chef should be careful atleast, with the salt."
"Fantastic food (taste + quantity) with good service !! One of real authentic restaurant in Kasarwadavali, Thane area. We had a thali for lunch over there and it was totally worthy with price they committed for it.

Loved it !!"
These ppl are really worthless... First a fall they couldn't find my address... The delivery boy was giving me missed calls... Initially I didn't understood that whose calling.. Then he called again and I picked up the call and was really laughing when he told me to call back then only he will tell me who he is... And then he just can't find my address.. I was really loosing my mind... Finally after 1.5 hours food arrived.. I ordered breakfast that had idli wada and uthappam..it was fine... 2 stars only for this...
"Very fast service , 1st time I ordered food at evening around 830 pm It was delivered within 15 minutes.2nd time I ordered break fast in morning at 1030 Am it was delivered within given time of 45 minutes. My 3rd order of two vegetable was delivered within 45 minutes at 1030 PM. I prefer this restaurant because I am a regular customer and know the taste of my tried and tested vegetable Cooked by staff.Value for money in small amounts."
"Good Place Good Food...
Its just that they will give you fried bhindi you ask for bhindi fry(and the sabji which is the case with rest of Mumbai ) ."
"If you want a simple home cooked feel, this is the place you should go for. I opted for home delivery and the food was there with me within half an hour even it was raining like hell outside.
I ordered 1 steam rice, 1 dal fry, 1 aloo Jeera and 2 chapatis.review comments below:
1. Food quality : Quality was good, dal was thick, chapatis were also soft and fully cooked from all sides (unlike few, will not take names :p)
2. Price : As compared to other restaurants in my locality, it is quiet economic.
3. Taste : As i said, i wanted to have simple meal so i ordered dal and rice, taste was satisfactory.

P.S - These are my personal opinions and i found it was worth ordering food from here."
Good restaurant for vegetarian. All food items have good taste. I don't prefer much veg items but whenever I order veg food only this restaurant comes in mind. Nice food.
It was late night and we had ordered food as we were very hungry.We had ordered some rice but the taste of rice was very bad and were not cooked at all.Also salt was missing from the rice .
"This is one place where I can save my money and still have a full meal. Me and my friends have been to this restaurant many times. The prices are within range. Food tastes good. The waiters have been good to me and the deliveries to my home have been not later than half an hour. Yes, there needs to be some improvement, but I couldn't ask more if they provide me food when I'm tight on budget."
"1.0 is a higher rating for this restaurant. Be careful people this restaurant is filled with cheaters. Yesterday I ordered lunch as home delivery, and the bill was 490. I gave a 500 note and the delivery boy gave me back 10. Then suddenly the boy started checking the note and showed me some colour on it and also showed it was torn a little bit and asked for other note. I was surprised because i had just taken the money from nearby ATM day before and all the notes were crisp as per my knowledge. I had no option but to take the torn note and give back another one. But after that while having lunch I felt like this guy did something. After lunch I checked with the society management for the...read more"
"Pursuing further with @eat within your locality"" I ordered a simple Pav Bhaji & a juice...which never got delivered for over an hour.It finally came at 4.15 pm (lunch).I politely declined it with my feedback of why I don't want it.
This was after my two calls & two more prompt call for action by Zomato team!Wondering if they have serviceable partner or just rush to register & expand!"
It's the WORST damn restaurant I've ever come across. Guys can't read for gods sake. It's taking over 2 hours for my food to arrive. I kept trying to guide them to my house with over 10 phone calls and finally losing my mind. The food still isn't here. Over this they're arrogant and don't even know to deal with customers. It's a NO in every way.
"It was late night and we wanted a Masala dosa while returning from Vashai for myu wife. So, my friend suggested this place which is right in front of my place. They were closing and we did not have much time to look for their interiors but I would say they were quite good looking at the cost of their items in the menus.

The first thing which I didn't like about them is that they did not tell me well in advance that they will not serve the dosa with Sambhar, what they did that they tell me at the time of delivery. That's not acceptable et all. Second, the chutney was not good which they provided with the dosa and it was more on the oily part. So, overall Check before you order ........"
Worst experience ordered at 9 pm did not receive order till 10:45 pm. Manager is rude and unapologetic. Food delivered was very cold and Unhygienic.
"Worst experience ever. The order was placed through zomato 1.5 hours ago. We are still waiting for the food to reach us. However many times we followed up, we are being told that the delivery boy is out with 10 parcels, hence taking time to reach us. Does that mean we eat our lunch at dinner time ??? Never order from this restaurant."
"Tried to order thrice, restaurant refused without any reason.

Ordered from them before but this is first time it has happened. Food is good."
Dont go by th looks of the hotel.. the food served indeed is amazing.. this had become our often visited spot when we had moved to thane.. the biryani is awesome..
Nice place have dinner.good veg food available.... I love pav bhaji its very tasty...good place to hang out with friends...overall good...nice veg curry's available. Also thali...
Worst for delivery on sundays...often I order something and get something else in it...happened 5/6 times in 1 n half month...one time found stapler pin in the rice...
Best and quality food.. And hats off for maintaining the delivery timing..i called and placed my order of choola bhathura. They said will deliver within 40mins(ie11:45). Exactly 11:44 the delivery boy has rang ma door bell.
Reasonably priced with ok food . Quite unlike restaurants at kasarvadavali which charge exorbitant and give crappy food or which charge cheap and give crappy food . Don't expect a gourmet food however food which is decent justified by the price charged .
"A hidden gem.
Their USP is reasonable price and amazing taste.
I went there twice and 1ce ordered south Indian.

I tried their chinese cuisine, where Paneer chilly was really great in taste and sizzling. We Ordered hong kong noodles which was bit burnt in taste.
we also tried their Punjabi food and taste was really worthy.

Strongly recomended for a visit.
Also their food delivery s on time and well packed."
"Wanted to give -5.0 rating, which was not present here. A Type of restaurant from where you can rarely expect timely delivery. And Plus a downsized food quality 

I had ordered a cuisine , that was uncooked and stale, and even after conveying the same to the concerned authority of the Restaurant, there was no proper response.

I Request to all those people who are looking for a delivery through this restaurant, should try any other restaurant rather than this one, as you will end getting bad quality food at their remarkable prices."
"So yes! This is purely Udipi based hotel.
Great valuable menu.

The south Indian is just Awesome like south indian , lol.

Thali's are of south, north and Maharashtran mixer.

Pav bhaji is superk

Ultimately a valuable hotel."
"Ordered home delivery so many times.
Very nice hotel, food is great and definitely value for money.
However go dine-in only if you don't care about ambiance or you want to eat out good food without spending much."
"This is your typical neighborhood idli-dosa-punjabi joint. Typical food, fairly reasonable price, fair taste, that about sums it up. When I need some inexpensive south-indian snacks, my quota of idli-dosa-vadai, I call them up. With free home delivery, this place is convenient too. My advice - use this joint to fill your stomach, don't expect anything gourmet out here. Good for the eating out craving without much money in your pocket."
Its value for money. Price is very reasonable. Food quality and test is also good. Ambiance is ok and may not suit for family. They provide free home delivery so I always prefer to have them deliver the food at home.
Good food.. Ambience is fair enough..
its value for money and good taste specially since new mgt took over
