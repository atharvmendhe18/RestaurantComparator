"Medu vada, chutney, sambar and masala dosa had one thing in common, and thats no salt!
Portion size was too small for the price and quality was not upto the mark."

vry nice
taste is good
"Didn't like it. felt like eating rubber. sambhar didn't taste much , felt like water"
Packing needs to be better and quantity is too less
"It was yummmm, quick and a very nice place to order for South indian breakfast"
great taste loved by my family and friends I am so happy
ordered idli. they sent idli which was stinking and had a foul odor. possibly last night's idli
dosa was not tasty this is the second time will not order again
"Don't buy anything from this restaurant,they served rotten chutney,cold dosa
Also it's overchary"
chutney was sour like it was frm long days ppl need fresh
"Idli and Mendu vada received in news paper, there is no safety followed by restaurant... it is highly unhinged"
low quality sambar abs chutney not satisfied. should improve the quality and quantity
Taste is good but not chutney was given no sambhar was provided
"Have ordered from this place quite often, their masala dosa and medu wada is nice. Crispy medu vada and masala dosa was decent. Overall happy with this place."
not good as I have eaten the masala dosa it's was raw
Packing and hardnest of sada dosa and butter masala was made in oil as there was no taste of butter
Not tasty unlike previous orders . Found change in taste . Packaging is very bad . Needs lot of improvement
"the person who prepared idli,wada,chutney&sambar is not from south,ask him to go south & learn to cook or learn from kubera restaurant. very bad at this rate the restaurant has to put lock. who ever gave reviews must be ignorant of south dishes"
"the sambar and chutney is all water. medu vada is good but water chutney spoils the whole experience.

please put less quantity and more quality in chutney and sambar."
Do not prepared as per cooking instruction.
pathetic.. the size of the medu vada is so dam small and they charge 50rs for it.. the chutney is just water.

"just look at the package and the idli and vada ,i had to throw it away as am pregnant i cant eat it"
fantastic medu vada. ordered cheese Mysore masala dosa and there is no cheese in it. if there is any I cannot taste it.
