"worst customer service ever , I had ordered the food just 1 min ago that I had wanted to cancel but they refused to cancel the order saying the delivery was already ready which was next to impossible, if the order was ready in a minute that means they are not serving fresh food , they argued with me over the call and in the end I had to forcefully buy the food . the person talking on the phone was very rude too , would never want to order food from here ."

not following instructions given
Pav was very dry not fresh. Pav bhaji it was just masala not cooked properly

"No proper packaging, food wrapped in plastic bags. looks like ordered from road side food stall"

Food is good
Soup was pethetic cant even taste one proper sip. Daal rice was good. Too much oil in roti. Cant have the home thaki feeling at all as they gravies had too much of masala.

worst food served
Medu vada was raw from inside and sour in taste. either it was over fermented or the dove was not fresh
for only 3 pieces of paneer
white coconut chutney is missing
"Horrible experience
Sandwiches were burnt cold without veggies
Medu Wada was sour not fresh
In all not edible."
Tasty. sambhar was superb. portion good enough for one person
