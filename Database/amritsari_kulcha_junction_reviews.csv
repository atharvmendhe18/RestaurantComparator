Oily food poisoning

Ingredients of Aalu tikki and Bhalla papdi chaat were not packed separately.. as a result the crispyness was completely lost.. it was like a soft mixture !! These items are supposed to be crisp and not soft because the vendor decided to mix curd and chutney to it.
"The packaging is expected to be as per potion ordered.
It all mixed and sent."

That was the worst butter chicken Iv ever had. How was that even a butter chicken?? It was no way near a butter chicken. And you guys call yourself ‘Amritsar Kulcha Junction’ ? Or may be only Kulcha’s are worth.. But butter chicken was a fail. Highly disappointed :(
