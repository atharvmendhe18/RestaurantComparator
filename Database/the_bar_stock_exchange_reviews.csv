full pizza is cold
prawns are smelly
neither the prawn basil not the Kung pao chicken were delicious... kung pao was missing the red chillies completely... it was strange Blanc and completely not a king pao... the prawns were just oily soya sauce covered.. not a single basil leaf in sight .. i think i guess this food is only for those beyond inebriated... sane people can please avoid

"The survice was very cheap, staff don't even serve until you say them and then to they do forcefully, and have mandatory survice charges. bar rates are ridiculous as they show on app and they didn't even inform about the app at first. food was average worst experience wasted my time and money here. very upset form TBSE. my day has been spoilt, first time I have ever hated any restaurant and had to give my review I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT"
"Chicken was well roasted and seasoned. I personally don't like cheese in indian rolls. But, overall it was great."
not value for money
we have received cold pizza ... order was placed at 8 pm and pizza delivered at 9 pm...
"The restaurant is always late
Please change the timing mentioned to avoid misinformation"
Paying service charge is mandatory. No if no buts.
worst food I ever had. very slow service
soggy and oily food
""
By the time food came after one and half hours because he had to deliver 2 orders it was cold so it didn’t taste good

Quite tasteless and bland. Asked to make it spicy but had no taste of garlic either

Items missing chicken pieces

"Must Must Must Recommended Rolls
Ordered Panner makhni roll and gave insturctions which were followed
Roll was loaded with panner very good packing and taste wise also best soft panner pieces smoky makhni flavour Just made my day
Thank u Bar Stock Exchange."
"No side onions sent, even after request. Nothing was delivered"
Poor quality
I'm amazed with the taste .
"good part :
portion and packaging was good.
bad part:
wings were very dry and the chicken was not upto the mark. possibly it would taste good in the restaurant but not good for delivery.

we have had better wings when delivered. this was just average wings and not great as we read in reviews. will try and order again and see if there is any improvement."
Excellent place
"The packaging is too bad, the oil was completely spilled over the bag."
"Bland food
Not proper butter
Not good taste
Ask to write a message even that not done"
Lollipop was bad
"amazing aglio e oilio

cooked well, lots of olive oil and garlic as well, which was perfect

but the two stars go away because the description said ""cheese"" and there wasn't any in my pasta.

also, the garlic bread was so good too. it had a generous amount of garlic and the right feel to it.

overall, great. but description is a bit deceptive. I'll order again."

quality not up to the mark
Charges service charge even with poor services and when the law says that you can’t charge service charge

"The chicken quality was bad, the chicken was not cooked through."
"Great taste, hygiene, well packaged. Have ordered food multiple times and they are consistent and amazing. Keep doing the great work team."
I went here last night with my friends. Vibes are good but the food taste is horrible with such brand name. And the service they provide is a mess. For order you need to download and install the app which takes 10-15 min to setup. Then you will get a food on your table which is not so good in taste. And the one who arrange table for customers is very arrogant and rude.
This restaurant imposes service charge of 10% which is not acceptable and done as per the government policy and if asked the same to the attendant they become stubborn about it
"The service was absolutely horrible. The whole place was empty and they refused to let us sit where we wanted to even though the WHOLE PLACE WAS EMPTY. We requested for a place where the light was not direct due to my migraine and they still did not consider it. The waiter was so mean and kept staring at me which made me very uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend this place at all.

The food on the other hand was also not that great. We ordered for a triple fried rice and it was very sweet. The chilly paneer was good but the whole experience was a 0/5."

"1. We ordered cocktails which were just sweet definitely did not have the required amount of alcohol, after telling them again and again they got it right, after the third drink
2. We ordered for Hummus which had a hair in it, they replaced it
3. Masala peanuts also had a hair in it
4. We ordered for Veg Thai Curry and they served us Thai curry with PRAWNS.

Is your chef drunk or your waiters are inefficient!

Such a horrible experience, wont recommend this place to anyone"
