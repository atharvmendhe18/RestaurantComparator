"A good place for all the vegetarian this place is always famous for its Morning breakfast and It's Pav bhaji. The food is also of good quality also it's has a good home delivery service.
Packaging was perfect the service was on time really loved it
Thank u so much for delivering in this high time"
"This is a good pocket friendly restaurant. This restaurant is very famous for Pav Bhaji.

Food 4/5
Service 4/5 ( quick service)
Ambience - ( certainly not good but can be ignored for its quick service and tasty food)"
A good place to eat whenever you want. It can be more cleaner but average ambience and staff. Snack items are good in taste.
Best for veg food
We decided to randomly try out mushroom cheese pav Bhaji at this place because of its uniqueness and it tasted quite well. The Bhaji had big chunks of mushrooms and was loaded with cheese. The service is quick and value for money!
"I have visited this restaurant many time  and each time i was happy.
Must tries:
Pav bhaji
Veg Kholapuri  with butter roti
Dahi wada
Masala Pav"
""
Very decent ambience but good food quality. Have tried their paneer tilka masala with naan and ot was too good.. their misal paav is a mist try
"Really good taste best place for family outing
Rating :4/5
In frame :Maysur chutney sada dhosa
Good taste buttery dhosa
Served with chutney and sambhar"
"Good place for lunch and morning breakfast.
Family place and typical Indian food with good taste and quantity.
Friendly environment. Good for kids too."
"A small local place with amazing food! Been here on a Sunday morning. While roaming with a group of friends with a hungry stomach and all other places being still closed at around 9 a.m., finding this place open was such a delight.

We decided to go in with basic expectations for a breakfast and ordered South Indian delicacies like Medu Vada, Idli, Dosa & Uttappam; whatever they served was top notch. The place is clean, and serves tasty food."
"Not so fancy restaurant.
Average food in taste.
Also the quantity is disappointing.
The ambience is simple,dont expect much.
The staff keep staring at you whole eating ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Also it doesnt3have ac so it might get a little hot as they have the kitchen just in front"
"Visited this place for a quick bite.
Ordered cheese onion uthappam and mosambi juice..
Cheese onion uthappam was good ans had lots of cheese in it. Even chutney and sambhar was decent.
Mosambi juice was also fresh..
Ambiance was decent and service was good.
Decent experience overall..."
Wenevr i am hungry in the afternoon and im dadar i always visit this restaurant. Very good pav bhajo and south indian food preparations. I even like veg manchurian dry. My very favourite dish. Highly recommended for vegetarian food lovers
Good food. We order mostly at home only some of the dishes which are good. Nice if you wish to have something on a budget. Friendly staff and prompt delivery. The seating area is different than shown in photos. Those photos are of neighboring sujata hotel. This is a simple non AC restaurant.
"Good food with good hygiene..
And budget Friendly hotel ..
I had visited there so many times with my friends for breakfast as well as lunch and dinner in very low cost.. service is also quick
Cost4/5
Taste4/5
Ambience 2/5
Service 4/5"
A pure vegetarian restaurant which is very well known for it's quick and good service in dadar. Would recommend for strict vegetarians.thumbs up
Anugraha hotel known as budget friendly. Taste was good and quantity is also good. I love the waiter treatment for customers. Hygiene is good. Highly recommended dish is paneer makkhanwala with roti.
"Good food at affordable rates. The food we had order were Panner Manchurian, Pav Bhaji, Masala Papad, Roti, Butter Naan with Veg Kofta, Veg Kolhapuri & Panner Tikka Masala. It was really good in taste."
Staff is way too rude. They used to be polite and courteous once upon a time but now are simply a pain in the you know what I mean and it's not any good any more
"Good food restaurant to dine with family as a casual dinning restaurant!! A small good restaurant is worth spending time, if you compare with many more good restaurants it is not that best but i can say a good restaurant!!"
"We celebrated birthday
We enjoyed with family we done dinner at last night at some hotel we get acidity but there were no acidity . The serving was nice"
"This is my go to place always for Pav bhaji. The taste never gets old. I have been going to this place since I was a kid. One of the very old places in dadar. Staff friendly with a fine ambience. But the highlight is the delicious taste of all the dishes. I have never had any dish here which I didn‚Äôt like. The pocket friendly rates are like cherry on cake. My favourites include Pav bhaji of course, besides that I like schezwan fried rice, rava dosa, chilly paneer, paneer pulao. I would definitely recommend this place."
"We were actually just passing by and the smell of paav bhaji made it irresistible for us to move ahead without tasting it

So we had
Cheese paav bhaji
And normal paav bhaji
It was nice not that exceptional
Paav was sufficiently laden with butter!!"
"It is just like a second home for me.
.
Food : The food tastes delicious. Starting from starter to desert.Good place for dinner.The food is bit spicy but still delicious.The Jain food is also tasty.
.
Service : The service is quick. Waiters are friendly. They serve happily....
.
Speciality's
Starter : Paneer Crispy and Manchow soup
Main course : Veg kofta,Veg malai kafta, Veg kohlapuri Paneer butter masala, Kaju masala, Paneer tikka masala, Paneer pasanda.....Veg Biryani, Paneer pulav, Triple sechwan rice.......
Desert : Dahi wada......"
"I've never been to this place before. One of my foodie friends introduced me to this place and we went there for dinner.
.
Food: starting with starters, we had paneer crispy which was very delicious and the paneer cubes were very fluffy and soft and you get the taste as soon as you put it in your mouth. Then ordered Kaju masala and butter naan. Kaaju masala was looking very appealing and its taste was better than how it looked as it was so yummy and with butter naan every bite became heavenly. Kaaju masala comes with cashews in it. And the butter naan too was very soft and perfectly baked. Serves 'Jain food' as well.
.
Ambience: It holds a good ambience nothing very fancy in this...read more"
"Alot to say about these restro..Anugragh is located near shivaji park..Anugraha is a pocket friendly restro where you can have your full lunch of two within 500 including desert..Must try dishes are paneer chilli,Green peas masala,kaju masala,Manchow soup,fried rice,dal khichdi.and also various types of icecrema"
"Worst food experience till now ,we ordered 4 veg Curries and received only 3 curries on takeaway.
When called back to inform them ,they denied and labelled us as ""FRAUD"". Poor work ethics by receptionist."
"‚≠ïThis is a home-like place to me. I almost visit this place twice a month. So it will be a detailed and long-term review.
.
üîµAmbiance: This place was always kind of dark and shady before, but now it is well lit. It is kind of average type of interior without any eye-catching designs or stuff. So nothing extraordinary in this field.
.
üîµFood: The most important thing. The food tastes delicious. But something yes, it's not that great. My experience being good for food at this place is 8/10. Still a good place for dinner with family. I found the Jain gravies of North-Indian food to be one of the best so far. Ya but it's a bit ""Masaaledaar"". The JAIN food tastes amazing...read more"
"Love their Sezwan/Hakka Noodles & Mushroom Fried Rice! üçú yummy smokey flavour! Also loove their Pav Bhaji.. Sometimes inconsistentüëå
Idli is also very good! We have tried their Bhindi Masala.. Which is also good. Their chapatis are good. Service in the restaurant is very good."
"I know Matunga east is supposed to be the South Indian heaven but this small joint is a hidden gem.
Had gone for a casual breakfast and fell in love with its south indian spread. So far the yummiest sambhar I have had.
I have tried their all kinds of dosa,Uttapam on the menu and nothing disappoints you. They even make the dosa/Uttapam crispy if asked:)
If you are too tired to visit Matunga east for a good early breakfast do visit this place."
Anugraha Pure Veg is located near shivaji park Dadar. This place offers you best quality and quantity food in reasonable rates. I almost tried all dishes and all are my favourite. But most liked dishes are paneer chilly. Taste of which i have not found anywhere else. Soft paneer and perfectly fried and yummy gravy. Dhai wada is another personal favourite dish of mine served with bundi which i found something different from other dhai wada i had.
"Good food. But the staff is not good, dont know how to talk to the customer. High Crowd, small space, slow service. Been only once so that was my experience."
"Courteous staff , quick service and tasty food. Udipi menu is customised to suit Maharashtrian palate. Good place for quick bites. A decent veg only restaurant centrally located and easy to reach.
I tried Cheese Pav Bhaji here. I liked the taste of bhaaji. Pav were fresh and super soft. Personally I think the menu is slightly over priced‚Çπ‚Çπ
Plus point: They add Butter generously.üòâüòã"
It is worth the price you pay... during morning do try South Indian especially schezwan dosa .. pav bhaji n dal khichadi is good ... value for money restaurant...
Been visiting this restaurant since a few years.. Must have pav bhaji.. Ordered a paneer tikka masala with butter kulcha and butter naan.. Very good in taste and quantity..
"Nothing more to say its worth the price .you will enjoy food dal khichidi was good, pulav is good, dosas are worth a try, misal pav and pav bhaji as it should be. Place is little congested but in Mumbai at this price its the place one can afford. Overall a good experience not a place where you should have a visit for some variety. A regular place for daily eaters or casual lunch or dinner"
"Recently paid a visit here with my friends. The service was quick considering it was a weekend. Based on one of our friends' recommendations, we preferred to order Chinese. Both the Paneer dishes: Chilly & Crispy were tasty. Liked the quantity & taste of the Schezwan Noodles, though it was a bit too spicy. Being located close to a busy main road, don't expect a good ambiance. Also the hotel too wasn't spacious; seemed as if just tables and chairs were arranged. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time here(only due to food & service). Would visit here again if possible.
Food - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
VFM - 4/5
Ambiance - 2/5"
"This restaurant located at shivaji park area n walking distance from my home. Have seen this restaurant for a number of years from childhood but been to it today for the first time. No sort of ambience simply just tables and chairs put. Only sum dim lights around. The space too is small just 12 or 13 tables.
Service here is quick and they serve with a smile on their face.

Coming to food this place is just like any restaurant serving most of items. We ordered cheese pav bhaji and menu wada sambhar which both quantity was good and both were tasty too. Filled with this food didn't have place to try more of their food. But the menu instead so I can order at home.

Pricing is just ok not...read more"
"This is one place which I never went to because of some of the presence of other popular restaurants in the vicinity.

In 2008 I first visited this place with a friend. I had a potato wada with sambar. And I was really impressed with the quality and size. From then on I have frequented this place often.

All types of dishes which they offer are good in general. Nothing stand out as such. But whatever I have had here till now has tasted well. Be it the idli, dosa, potato wada, pav bhaji, dum aloo etc.

I will surely recommend this place. Especially because people generally consider other popular options in the locality to this. This is equally good if not better."
Just a random visit to this place for there mushroom cheese pav bhaji! Must say it's really yummy like lots of mushroom goes in and it's not just for the name sake! Never heard something like this and Its totally worth every money you spend! Also would like to mention abt the sweet Lassi which I orderd was make to perfection thick and creamy just the way I like it not so ambience friendly please but that can be ignored for the food they serve
"A perfect vegetarian hotel....
Vegetarian food of this hotel is awesome. Paneer makhanwala or anything veg is very tasty. So sit down at eat all you can eat. It is a very nice place to eat for a vegetarian."
"Nice, small and cosy place. Food is nice. Service is a bit slow and sometimes erratic. But reasonable cost, good tea and snacks. A place for a quick bite!"
"Very useless service...one should not order from here.. delivery boy would not know the address so denied my order...

I would opt any other competitors of theirs"
"It's been many years since I've visited this vegetarian restaurant so can't recollect anything regarding its ambiance or interior. I can vaguely recall indulging in their dosas, the sada or plain dosa and masala dosa and I can remember the taste which had been really, really good, if not very well. The name of this pure veg eatery is by the way simple, homey and warmly inviting."
"If you are lookin for a lavish meal look elsewhr this restaurant is decent n good(some may call it cheap).
Ambeiance is typical as that of any mumbai restaurant, service is good, staff is alert & quick. It is full during meal tyms so plan in advance waiting tym is 10 15 mins max..
Nw the food is good both quality n quantity wise.. punjabi dishes highly recommened.. southindian & chinese r good too..
All in all good restaurant for a decent meal.."
"Typical low key Indian veg restaurant. Food quality is good. Quite a famous restaurant in Dadar. Difficult to get a table during peak hours, unless you're alone. Economical and lay mans place to dine.

Another thing worth mentioning is that they claim that they have free home delivery, which is not actually the case.
I ordered a dish at the restaurant, and then I ordered the same thing to be delivered, the cost was a little higher than when I ate at the restaurant.
They have a different take away menu, which already incorporates the cost of delivery but does not mention it anywhere."
"Breakfast on Friday morning in Anugraha.üòã
--Tried for South Indian Dosas
--Really worse in Crispiness
--No Taste in Sambar at all (it was as liquid as Rassam)üò´
--Cheap in Prices as compared to Neighbour hood eating joints. Same is the case with quality too.üòí
-- The only good thing was prompt service.

This was my first and last visit there for sure.
RIP DOSA @ Anugraha.. üò¢"
"Very disappointed with the food here. I tried the uttapam and rawa dosa. Uttapam was sweet, very unexpected. Dosa was average. the sambar was extra sweet. Won't visit again."
Veg Kolhapuri was bitter and oily.Veg Pulav was ok with lot of paneer pieces. Sambhar and chutney are not at all good.Chutney is watery and tasteless. They should focus on FOOD QUALITY. Rates have been hiked.
This place is at Ranade Road.A normal family restaurant.Good veg crispy but a bit sweet.Dal tadka khichidi is a must try out here.In the main course paneer butter masala is good with the dal tadka fry.Punjabi dishes are good out here.
"I had a very bad experience dining here. Service was too slow and quality of food was not at all worth its price.

Think twice before dining here."
Food tastes good n homely. Yesterday i went to ddr for somework n during lunch i saw this restaurant. Its simple restaurant with good n tasty food n good service too.
"A nice & a pure veg budget restaurant so anyone can have a visit even with a less cash in your pocket. Located near Portuguese Church Dadar(W).Their Indian vegetarian dishes are worth to try & are really good.Snacks here are also nice. Bachelors like me are always in a search of such places as you can enjoy your meal in budget & with such a good quality.The cost for two people here is almost 200.A must try place in Dadar west. Try anything,most of the dishes are really good but some may be worse but they are very few or least in a number compared to good ones."
"#Anugraha its like second home to me love the food here my wife too loves it here the # misalpav good so are other food items....
We eat into a friendly atmosphere great experience n the special treatment we get here love this place üç∑üç∑"
"The ambience was modest at best, nothing great. The service when I went was bad, food arrived late and staff was very unresponsive. Even though the food was good, the bad service meant I left the joint extremely angry and unsatisfied."
"Good food guaranteed. Cheese pav bhaji, spring rolls & baby corn mushroom masala are my personal favourite s here.
Fast home delivery and good food."
"A good place for delivery, great selection of vegetarian food. One of the quickest delivering in Dadar. Pav bhaji is a must try at this place"
"Wonderful hotel. I am almost regular here. Tasty food. Food quality is good and maintained. Service is quick, even for home delivery. South Indian should be preferred here."
"Good vegetarian restaurent, near ranade road. Quick delivery. Good Service. Have maintained food quality. Its not big but good for take aways."
"I have been here only in the evenings to drink some good tea. Alongside tea i ended up ordering French fries. The french fries are crispy and 'chatpatta'. And to make it even more Indian, its accompaniment is curd and chutney. What a combination ! I've never really had a meal here but would some day love to :)"
"I can only put down my review about their food as am always lazy enough to barg into a restaurant alone. This was one such occasion. The food is delicious and maintain the authentic north indian taste which a true foodie always expect and the good thing about this place the naan are not at all sweet and crispy as I faced most of the restaurant's do so.The lassi was another star to its cap which was very well packed and taken me to the punjab while gulping it down. Over all you looking for something tasty in veg at affordable rate, hit it down here! !!"
Good quality veg food
The Restaurant Is Located At The Heart Of Dadar . Just opposite shushrusha hospital . Ambience Is Not That Good. Lacks Space . Though They Have 2 AC Rooms But Not Spacious . As Far As Service Is Concerned Its Good. Food Quality Is Again Good but Quantity Not Upto The The Price . It Needs To Increase the quantity .
"We went to this restaurant on a Sunday evening. There were a few families waiting outside and the irritation of waiting period to be faced starts. Surprisingly, most of the families took away their parcels and left the place. We entered and were politely pointed to an empty table. Water was served and later Menu Card was dropped on our table with equal politeness. We thought this would be a typical Udipi restaurant specializing in South Indian items. But the menu card had everything - South Indian, snacks, Chinese, Punjabi, faloodas, desserts and ice-creams as well. A craving since long time and we saw a direction - Chinese.
