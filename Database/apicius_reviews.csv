Review
Why did you guys stop making the pesto pizza? That was the best thing on your menu! Ordered the new spinach corn calzone today but was pretty disappointed.
"*Went there for a corporate party!*

Located slightly off the link road, on 8th floor of a building it may be difficult to locate, they need to put up some big boards to show directions. The place is pretty huge. There are many tables. Round tables for 6-8 people, long tables for 15-20 and so on! The theme is kind of raw where the walls and furnishings are pretty raw and don't have any fancy catchy decorations etc. 

There is an inside area which has a huge bar and that's where the dance floor was also arranged for us. If that is their regular dance floor then it is very small and can get super uncomfortable. The DJ was boring honestly, nobody seemed to be enjoying the music! The...read more"
"Ambience is quiet good for all the Music lovers! Food is Good, but the place is not so spacious as expected. If you are a beer person and like to dance all night in a casual floor with some variation of lights then this is the place for you."
"The perfect Chicken Tikka Pizza with the best desi spices. Also, ordered a brownie, which was not good at all, but the pizza covered up for all of it. Would recommend it to pizza lovers."
"I order regularly via FP, and whilst it does take a little while to be delivered, the pepperoni pizzas are outstanding. On a par with Pizza Express in England and I will continue to order. Please try to deliver quicker!"
I wish I could give anything below 1. Ordered Veg Mexican pizza and I received a half baked pizza loaded with just Rajma... It was tasteless and will not recommend this to anyone else. Horrible experience.
"Nice ambience but the Food was average the worst part was DJ playing the worst music, I felt like I was a part of a wedding function, the guy barely knew what is to be played at what time for what crowd...sad"
"I ordered a ""make your own 12inch"" pizaa was above average actually excellent, good quality bread and cheese used. a very good experience.

I would be ordering again, the cost of this pizza was half of what you would pay with a known brand.
Also this pizza is close to the actual pizza one gets in italy or europe, so its very possible that people who have not travelled and are used to Indian style pizza on thick bread with masala wont be happy.

its a place with a small menu, so trust me whatever you order would be fresh and good quality"
"Have never gone to the place so this is purely based on the taste.

Ordered a Paneer Schezwan pizza for the first time and it was really good. Lots of toppings and the paneer was really soft with was nice. The overall taste was very good.

Ordered the Paneer Tikka for the second time and it was the best pizza I have ever had hands down. And saying this means something coz I have was a Joey's fan before but now I am hooked to this place.

All this when I have not even mentioned the price till now."
"Found out about the place through Foodpanda. We ordered in a Chicken Tikka Pizza and a Chicken Mexican Pizza along with a Garlic Bread with Cheese. Loved the crust. Personally, the Chicken Tikka was better than the Mexican. Definitely a must try."
"My friend told me about this place, so we ordered 2 pizzas one pepperoni pizza n other 4 cheese pizza with extra toppings.
I must say the pizzas were tasty and worth try , 4 cheese gave best taste with fresh toppings and was up to price but it was not served hot if it was served hot it would taste more delicious , I think next time they will take care of it but indeed a gud taste and quality ..."
We ordered a large pepperoni pizza. It was perfectly done. I'm so glad I got to know about this place. Loved the pizza! Will be ordering again for sure üòç
"Insanely good pizzas at incredibly low prices. I used to order their Mexican Pizza all the time and it was amazing, and all for 200 bucks. Their paneer tikka pizza too is pretty great. I moved to an area recently where they don't deliver anymore and I genuinely feel bad about that. I've never been to their outlet but if I'm in their area, I am definitely gonna pay them a visit."
Cold and very pathetic pizza ..never ask for home delivery and when u communicate to them they will say that our quality is good so u cannot say anythings
"Ordered in via foodpanda, the food was very okay , judging by the pizza that was delivered I don't think I will be ordering in again. Still have to visit and see if the taste or quality is any different ! For now I think 3.5 is a good enough rating !"
"Apicius serves the best pizza this side of Italy. Very innovative combinations. Generous toppings. All pizzas are thin crust, so one really enjoys the flavours. I have tried each and every, veg & non-veg variety. The brownie is totally OMG. Haven't noticed the prices as the food is superlative."
"A decent pizza. Tried due to foodpanda discounts,but the pizzas are too thin as if it went under a road roller multiple times before baking .Delivery was quick but the taste was ok ok."
"Placed an order with FP for this place took over 90 minutes to have it delivered. It was obvious by this that the order would not remain fresh. So i had to pay for COLD PIZZAS( highly not recommended). The pizza i ordered was 4 chesse and what i get is a THICK LAYER OF CHEESE which by noway is equal even 2 cheese. So i called nd complained and what i hear in return is ""sir we have no complaints so far and we don't do replacement for any one. In future we will definitely take care and have it delivered hot( what about the pizza u jst delivered??? ). Sorry i cannot take a risk of ordering FOOD FROM HERE AGAIN!!!"
"The Contact number mentioned here does not seem correct, Nobody is answering the phone calls and once someone picked up and said, call the another number and disconnected abruptly.

Please update the same soon.

Thanks"
"An amazing restaurant nestled in Andheri. Tried the pasta, pizzas and lebanese sides. Everything cooked to perfection. Spaghetti and penne pasta with chicken in red sauce, delicious, heavenly and pocket friendly too. Highly recommended. Have been ordering out 5 times a week eversince this opened :)"
"The Pizzas are good, generous portion of toppings and the quality of the pepperoni was surprisingly good as well. The pasta on the other hand was over cooked and runny, almost inedible I would say. Stick to the 12"" Pizzas and you'll be happy!"
"Worst pizza i ever had in my lifetime. Till date i have tasted many different pizza centres however this one is the worst i ever had in my life. I ordered their pizza from food panda. I had ordered Mexican pizza and to my surprise the pizza which i got was very hard to eat which means it wasnt made fresh and just baked delivered to us. Not only that mexican pizza had all the ingredients of Indian flavour like RAJMA, Kotmir, etc. Who the hell put rajma, kotmir etc on pizza.. WTF! The pizza was so hhard to eat that even my puppy couldnt eat and just left it aside for me to throw in the dustbin. HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED and DISSATISFIED. After this attempt i would never want to try any other new...read more"
I heard this place has amazing pizzas and hence decided to order one for lunch. I'm very disappointed as the pizza was cold by the time it reached me. The flavoring on the pizza was good but I couldn't enjoy it was the pizza the cheese was dry by the time I could start eating. Highly disappointed.
"Apicius is an old time favorite. Love the way they try to blend authenticity of different cuisines on Indian palate. They recently started with pizza delivery. Their thin crust pizzas are beautifully cooked with generous layer of pizza sauce and good helping of veggies, that others are stingy about. Their pesto is also delicious and I loved their garlicky penne Alfredo. Its an absolutely value for money place for pizzas. They deliver on time with good packaging.
Welcome change as I have now given up on Domino's and Pizza Hut."
"Awesome restaurant ambions as great roof top bar n well decorated important wines winery n all its nice to look

Managers and all staff was friendly
