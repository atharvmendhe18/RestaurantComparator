I ordered for beef do pyaza . I got chicken do pyaza. I send video and pic to Zomato but they could not figure out. beef do pyaza comes normally as a boneless pieces of meat. this has bones an white meat. beef is pinkish meat. I have had this before from this restaurant. I have attached a picture. it's a breast piece with wish bone. how will beef breast be like this. I paid for something and got something else. this is ridiculous . did not expect this from this restaurant

Gravy is so bad
The quantity of rice should be more in biryani rest all is perfect 👍

"I have received beef boti fry instead of what I ordered ""chicken boti fry"" . Dear Zomato this has happened for the second time you'll can't keep escaping by delivering beef and then replacing it when you have already hurt human and religious sentiments!"
delicious food

"all the gravies are so much salty..even i waste my money. if i get a chance i will not give any of the star to gravies.
