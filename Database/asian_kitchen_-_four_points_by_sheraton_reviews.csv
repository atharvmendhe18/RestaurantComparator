Review
"The dining experience fell below expectations. Despite booking a table for three, we were met with a lackluster reception at the entrance, where no staff were present. After a 10-minute wait, we approached the manager to request our reserved table. Once seated, we had to take the initiative to ask for water and menus as the waitstaff seemed inattentive.

Regarding the food, the starters, including crispy fritters and veg cutlets, were disappointingly oily. One paneer dish even had an unexpected fish oil taste. The chicken tikka lacked flavor and was overly dry. The chaat, consisting of pani puri and dahi puri, was average at best. The salad counter and Dahi wada were also subpar; the wada...read more"
"This Sunday brunch buffet Asian kitchen located in Four Points by Sheraton, Vashi, Navi Mumbai is something which you should try. Live music and huge buffet from salads and soups, to huge variety of starters in different cuisines, Indian street food and main courses. Serving cocktails (on demand) and mocktails on the buffet to an amazing array of assorted desserts. We fell in love with the gourmet brunch buffet and would like to recommend this. Coz folks- you need to try these!! I am sure you will go crazy like we did over the taste and variety."
"Food is not at all good. had dahi bhalla and chana papdi chaat and they were overtly sweet. Their desserts were also too sweet.
Spread is way limited for the price we are paying.
They had called a singer to perform, the speaker was too loud, especially for such a small space. I even asked them to reduce the volume but they just ignored"
"we visited Asian kitchen for lunch a couple of days before new year. They try to position themselves as a high class restaurant but the food is anything but high class. Most of the food is quite ordinary and some of the food items were outright bad.
They served fish tikka labelled as a chicken dish. Nothing was done even after multiple people pointed it out to the staff. the chilly chicken was hard and chewy. Nothing else in non veg starters. Main course at best can be described as very ordinary.
In dessert only gajar halwa was good, but they soon ran out of it and it wasn't refilled till we left. There was a caramel pudding which was completely burnt!!!

"The establishment boasts a remarkable ambiance characterized by scenic views and comfortable seating. Commencing with the beverage selection, the singular offering, Kala Khatta, impresses with its authentic and enjoyable taste. Transitioning to the Bread and Salad offerings, the array of beautifully crafted salads, notably the Bacon Salad and Bacon Salami, stands out. However, the limited variety of bread, including less appealing options like garlic bread, detracts from the overall experience.

In the Starter category, a diverse range of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options captivates the palate. Regrettably, the absence of lamb dishes in the main course and a somewhat limited...read more"
The restaurant has not given offer on drinks
"Love the ambiance here, food is always delicious and a better spread compared to other 5 stars around in Navi Mumbai. No brainier for us to come here for special occasions."
food was stale
"Disgusting service and pathetically stale food. Seafood made us all sick. We had booked a table for dad’s 70th birthday. And all I can say is that this place is an utter disaster. No one to attend for like 30-45minutes. We had to look for people to ask where our food is. It took over an hour to serve. Since we didn’t reserve any other place we ended up staying. And omg the food turned out to be terrible too. And the funny part was when I went to complain, two other people were there doing the same with the same reason of super late food service and stale food. Zomato shouldn’t host such restaurants in the future. The review rating is fake. Please avoid this place at all cost. Also...read more"
food was served after 25 min delay in service
"The food and service both were atrocious. Inspite of giving feedback regarding the food, the Chef kept arguing with us.
I feel extremely sad that the quality has deteriorated so badly."
The main course and chicken starter was good but the desert could have been made better
The food was cold and not tasty at all. The service was as pathetic as the quality of food. A complete revamp at all levels is required.
"If you have had good food before, do not go here. This place located inside the four seasons nonetheless offers just about the most ordinary to aweful take on making food. The cost is up there is the high stratosphere but the food is just naala. They even screwed up the basics, rice (undercooked), dal makhni (just butter and cream and bitter flavors), raita (stale boondi) ro name a few. The only good dish we got was chilly paneer. There was a cocktail with rasna and some spirit, a bad to stale red wine. Just avoid it and go to any other establishment nearby."
The restaurant staff didn't make a table available despite prior booking through zomato gold. extremely disappointing
"Awesome place, nice service, served by Hussain and Kunal. Was a joy"
They charged me extra bill they tha be changed the charge from 1st sep but Zomato has not updated the charges Zomato has give 699+tax but not it’s 1499rs Zomato must update this price change

2 star is for the service and ambience . If you are looking for good food don’t opt for this place.
"It's one of the most disappointing places I've visited in Mumbai. I may be more annoyed cos it was my birthday dinner. The ambience, the food and service-everything was a big let down right from the salad to the main course. The dessert Tiramisu(a pastry) was okay.
I saw people eating Indian cuisine and I assume that is the only option that is edible. Will definitely not visit to give it a second chance. The food may look okay in the pictures but the meat was stale and leafy was bitter. Thankfully there was Zomato gold so it was not too heavy on the pocket because of which I'm leaving 2 stars."

"Asian Kitchen is one of the oldest places in Vashi which offers a luxurious dining experience. We recently went here for our anniversary and it was indeed a wonderful celebration with good food and live music playing in the background.

We had made reservations but it being a Sunday the place was quite packed. After waiting for half an hour we got a free table and settled down, with mocktails promptly served on our table. We chose to try the Sunday brunch buffet.

There's an assortment of mocktails, salads, appetisers, breads, and soups to begin with. Main course has multiple items, while rotis are served on your table. There are Chinese and Thai dishes and also live counters for pasta...read more"

Food variety and taste wasn’t good… Mutton and prawns was missing in the buffet

"The food was not hot, starters were sort of stale and they charge 325/- for one water bottle and don’t inform you about the same. On the other hand, service of the waiters was good and they took our feedback. Hope that’s taken into consideration."
