"Hotel Archana has not prepared food on time as per Zomato Delivery boy. Ordered placed at 9.30pm, spoke to hotel Archana person at 10.35, then also order was not prepared by them BCS they have not seen the online orders of Zomato as per concern person. Then why Zomato have such partners who is not respecting your online orders. Spoke to Hotel Archana person but no proper response from his end. Zomato should reimburse our money back bcoz in mean time we prepare food at home and had it. Food and money is waste. Zomato has to take action and see to it our money get it back. order was placed at 9.30 pm and delivered at 11.27pm. One of worst service I could see it."
"worst pav bhaji till now

"Ordered veg handi jain and jain paneer Biryani. Both orders arrived post 30 minutes and came with Onions in them. To rectify the order, it took them 20 more minutes."
"I found a pocket friendly place in mulund
If you want to chill with your friends or if you want to have fun with your family or to have dinner this is the perfect place for you
The ambience of the restaurant was amazing

Ambience 10/10ü§©
Price 8/10üòç"
"I am slowly going to reduce the time I order online since the hotels are jacking up their prices, plus we pay delivery charges, plus taxes"

it was good
rice was too dry... manchurian too less. wish it had taste
was not spicy. delivery boy was very quick had delivered order quicky. just the utappa was not spicy.
pathetic
Proper order not received‚Ä¶.see image‚Ä¶.how can I eat‚Ä¶.I want cash back‚Ä¶..packing was not good by hotel
"This is one of my favourite restaurant in Mulund. One should definitely try Paneer Satay, Veg Crispy and their Chinese Sizzler.

Will keep visiting here!"
"Mysore masala dosa was good not up to the mark, but was fine. But the thing with Medu vada is when you have it with sambhar it almost taste like water, sambhar was not that good.."
Loved food the dishes r too tasty from pav bhaji to paneer tikka all good mushrooms tikka is a must try
Chutney was spoiled and sambhar not like expected from Archana
"The quality of the food is easily great - no complaints about the food at all.

But the restaurant charges a rather high amount for ""packaging"" - which is a clear rip off. It comes to around 10% of the bill, but its just simple plastic boxes & regular tinfoil wrapping paper & cardboard boxes. Nowhere does it justify the high amount. Will make us rethink ordering again from here, surely."
"food was nice
packaging was also good
deliveey was on time
but price was really high"
paneer angara's taste is worst n no salt was added in food..No one is happy with this restaurant
did not recieved pan fried noodles instead recieved paneer rice

"Extremely unprofessional staff, they don‚Äôt follow any good instructions despite repeating it. Not recommended for anyone."

This place is very close to my house and i often visit this restaurant for some light snacks. They serve some amazing South Indian snacks and the pav bhaji here is lipsmacking.
