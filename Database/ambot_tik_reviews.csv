"Ambot tik serves lip-smacking Goan and Chinese food.
The Xacuti masala is authentic and packed with loads of flavour.
The squid butter garlic is a must-try.
In Chinese, the Schezwan Lollypop is drool worthy and the Chicken Crispy is perfect.
They serve pretty good Indian food too.
They serve a variety of Biryanis apart from the normal Chicken Biryani.
Do ask the staff for suggestions and we're sure you won't be disappointed.

"Awesome!!!! Specially for Goan food and seafood is worth trying, best I have had in thane. Very reasonable, Family Friendly atmosphere and very hospitable."
"The food here is wonderful! We ordered pork chilli fry, Goan sausages pulav and bombil fish thali. We loved it! The quantity was exceptionally good. Two people could easily can eat it in one plate. The taste is good and the price is affordable. Highly recommend this place."
"Food Quality & Quantity is good. Thali is best option. Biriyani lovers can try Matka Biriyani. Clean place.
For fish lovers it can also be an option."
"Had dinner with friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Ambience is good, Nice staff, Service was awesome. Will be back definitely!"
"Good food with affordable price..nice place.. They have Matka biryani, Solkadi, Goan fish curry üçõ..caramel custard and also have bibinca ...must visit with friends or family..."
"Today visited Ambot Tik in evening at Castle Mil, Ambience is good, have issue with parking in front of hotel, I have ordered Mutton Kolhapuri with Tandoor roti, Food test and service is good with reasonable price, if you have dining plan then Ambot Tik is better option to you. Hotel area is small and AC service not available hence please avoid to lunch plan in Ambot Tik else it's Good and Affordable."
"Nice food joint they serve all varieties foodlike Chinese,indian , tandoori & Goan food we tried all cuisine we enjoyed food , keep it up good work ."
"Good food & decent place
fish bombil rawa fry too tasty . Pomfret goan curry
Frrsh lime soda presentation was super....
PRICE is very reasonable"
"I have got food delivery from this hotel, liked it but had a very bad experience at the restaurant. staff was inattentive no one was really caring if we order or not they primarily focused on the delivery part and chose to ignore us and a side table.


Very bad experience visiting these guys. they didn't even care customers leaving their restaurant.

food ordered earlier : 4/5
Service: 0/5
Ambience : 3/5"
Would not have given 1 star even ... it was a time when i was in love with seafood of ambot tik ... but now it‚Äôs absolutely ruined ... ordered rechardo pomfret and what I received was stale pomfret with a cpl of spoons of rechrdo sause .... never ever order food from amotik again
Great food at a great price! Love the fish plates as well as the salads...goan food is just üòãüòã..Love this place!.. Must visitüòé spend your time with your lovable oneüòçüòç
"Had ordered chicken lollipop which is not supposed to be bad at all. It's a staple dish and if you get it wrong, then something really serious is happening with the food quality. The chicken lollipop was so so bad and burnt and stale that the entire dish costing 155 was like a pack of ash. This joint has really lost the quality of food it used to serve. Would ask people to stay away from here, just cause I want you to enjoy your lollipop"
"This place took over two hours to deliver my lunch, given it was a public holiday, zomato told me that they were having a lot of orders, so I needed to wait for an additional half an hour (an hour after I placed the order) and so I did, and the food hadn't been delivered even still, on contacting the customer support, they told me that they couldn't get in touch with the restaurant, nor the delivery guy. Furthermore the status of the order changed to delivered, when It definitely wasn't. Support kept telling me to wait for 15 minutes everytime I reached out to them. The food arrived rather late, when it was nearly tea time. Very disappointed at the service."
A mismanaged restaurant. Why dont they stop taking orders when they have delivery constraints. It took almost 2 hours to deliver my lunch. Over that they stop answering phone calls. Will you pay to get such below par services?
"Great Place, Ambience is alright! Service was quick and on point. Though it's just a 8-10 table place , food tastes pretty well! Also they have quite well portion of food. Goan cuisine is too unique and tastes so good!"
Ordered Dal Khichdi Tadka. Quantity is really good and the taste is good as well. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're out of ideas on what to eat.
"My favourite place for nonveg ..
nice staff and amp
Me and family enjoy all food from here..
Chicken tikka masala , Bangada fry ,pot biryani very nice"
"Had ordered through Zomato , Goan sausage and pork fry
I had Goan food earlier but this version was different
I would prefer Martin‚Äôs at Colaba anytime"
"Been here on Friday with two friends... Ordered Kolhapuri Chicken Tandoori,Chicken Crispy, Chicken Tikka Biryani and Caramel Custard.
1) Kolhapuri Chicken Tandoori :- Exceptionally awesome taste with wonderful marination and perfect cooking.(Only one drawback is that they serve only half portion viz 4 pieces.. if visiting with larger group you've to order 2-3 portions.
2) Chicken crispy:- Name justified... Chicken pieces were crispy till last piece in the plate. Taste was also nice.
3) Chicken tikka biryani:- Average Tikka biryani.. Nothing much to say.
4) Caramel Custard:- It was nice except the Caramel syrup was less thick.

Staff is friendly and service is quick.
Will definitely visit...read more"
I have been ordering from this place regularly and it has never disappointed me. But today I ordered full chicken tandoori and I was really disappointed when I found a cockroach in my salad. And now I'll think before ordering the next time. Ambot Tik please take care of this. It is something serious.
"We had ordered for dinner. However the food was absolutely cold and one of the dish was pungent (spoiled). Dishes ordered were Chicken pahadi kabab, Chicken chilly, Boneless Chicken Tawa masala , Boneless Chicken tikka masala, Butter tandori roti and normal tandoori roti.
The taste of chicken pahadi kabab was fabulous but rest all the dishes was tasteless. Boneless chicken tawa masala was spoiled. Very disappointed"
"Excellent food quality. I am so happy with the quality of food and service that, I seldom order food from any other restaurant. Hopefully they will continue to maintain same standard."
Really good food.. Authentic goan food! Highly recommended. I enjoyed its goan fish curry and chicken xacuti. The portions are generous and so go ahead with this place.
"The chicken tikka masala was stale, stomach upset the next day"
I ordered egg schezwan rice and it was average to be honest....nothing great
Pork Chilly - The dish is not at all worthy ......You guys need to learn how to cook chilly items when Chinese cuisine are considered . The recommendation dishes are really fake and I really don‚Äôt understand why it is not getting filtered by Zomato . Kindly taste the item if I am wrong .
Had ordered food at home... everything was really good. The kingfish was super fresh and really tasty. The potato chicken chops were very tasty and the filling was superlicious. The chicken lollipop was nice as it had minimum coating on it. The chicken tikka Biriyani was delicious too. All in all paisa vasool food .. must try
good food. balanced flavours.
"excellent out of the way service.
part of my delivered order was incorrect. so I contacted the restaurant regarding the same. to my relief they said they were happy to have my correct order resend within next 30mins, and in the next 20 minutes the delivery guy was at my door step with the right order and an heartfelt apology, no frills.
The food was delicious and piping hot as it should be.

mistakes are human nature, but how you handle that is what makes the difference. now that's what I call owning up to honest mistake and rectify it in such way so as to leave a lasting pleasant impression on customer."
food was good... rice quality was not that good as we get at their place
Awesome ... as always
I just love to eat chicken biryani and this place makes me crave for more. Being honest it's a small place but I don't mind having it from here as it's always tasty
"Ordered today after a long time and the bad reviews made me want to.
Had a pork roast all by myself. Enough for two people but I hogged it. So no problem about quantity or taste.
Also ordered chicken cafreal and chicken 65 for the wife and daughter who gave a thumbs up. They are very fickle about tastes so I'm happy. Also bhakris are awesome and the solkadi added a final finish to the wonderful meal."
We visited this place on 19th Oct 2018. Place is neat and clean. But the food was not upto the mark. We ordered chicken lollypops and they were just a bone fried with flour no flesh on it. We ordered pork chilly and they served mainly pork fat pieces. Chicken xacuti was of only black pepper masala. We have disappointed with the taste.
"Place with good taste
Especially chinese and sea food
Simply loved it
Ambience is good
Service and staff is good
Overall good place to visit"
The food was very yummyüòãüòãüòã everyone should try the foodüòãüòã the most important thing is the service is very good üòç loved itüòò The Chinese food was good Triple fried rice was yummy...
Food taste is very good and fast delivery we have order more than 20 to 25 times. I love this goan food. You are order from here n experience taste
"Their food quality is going terrible. We had ordered some Goan food , as we have done before. They buggered up my order and instead of apologising, they started quaralling with the lady folks in my house . Food connoisseurs should avoid ordering food from this place ever. OMG THEY ARE SPOILING THE GOAN FOOD TASTE ."
"Hey I ordered Veg Manchurian and American Chopsuey. The quantity of Manchurian was too less but the quantity of American Chopsuey was fine. The taste was not upto the mark. Moreover, while ordering I especially wrote that it shouldn't be spicy at all but they didn't bother to even take my request. ONE bad experience of ordering..won't order again."
We had ordered food from here which was chicken main course. Being honest I liked the taste however family members found it very oily. But taste is good for sure.
"Ambot Tik is probably the only restaurant I've rated '5 Stars' in over the years. Reason? Food was loved by everyone on the table. A bit difficult to find and wrongly placed on Google Maps, this place comes out to be a medium sized10 table restaurant. Knowing how popular it is, I seriously recommended them to expand. Now food! Ordered a few starters which included Croquette Chicken, Chicken Pahadi Kabab and Prawns Butter Garlic which came in decent quantities. Croquette Chicken are rolls of chicken - slightly sweet, mixed with some veggies served with spicy green chutney. Prawn Butter Garlic are prawns saute in Butter and Garlic and some other spices served beautifully. Chicken Pahadi...read more"
nice..I have ordered biryani..its pretty good..
"Chinese from this restaurant is very nice
Indian food is not great, I recommend chicken Manchurian, triple chicken schezwan rice, paneer manchurian"
nice food
"Awesome and Authentic Goan cuisine.
You won't be disappointed.

You'll find them close to Castle Mill Naka, at Uthalsar. You can't miss them, due to the big neon sign outside.

Try their goan fish curry, kalamari chilly fry, goan fish rawa fry, caramel custard and sol kadi.

Meat fans can also try their Chilly Fry, Roast, etc.

Good portion sizes and value for money.

Best place for die hard goan fans. A taste Goa right here at Thane.

Just remember there's NO AC seating. Ambience is simple, just enjoy your food."
really nice food and prompt service
"Today we had Sorpetel and Chicken Xacuti with Rice bhakri and Triple fried rice. As a Goan I will say it was perfect in taste and at reasonable price.
Always maintain the taste and quality of ingredients."
hardly any chicken pieces
Our family all time favorite. Always been food delivered at home within the time frame. Food quality n quantity is good. Service is great. Please don't let the quality n quantity dip.
I ordered shwarma from this place! Must say one of the best!! Well cooked! Amazing blend of spices.. mouth watering! Dal khichdi as always best! Would love to explore the menu for sure!!
The delivery person was very cooperative.
"I ordered the chilly pork, it caught me by surprise. Pretty good. The meat was fresh and well cooked (something I don't find true around Thane-Mumbai most of the time). If you're skeptical about ordering pork dishes (like me) , this one can be trusted for sure."
"Ordered two chicken dishes for dinner- Chicken masala and chicken methi.
They are pocket friendly priced at 165 and 195 bucks but weren't that delicious. The chicken methi was better than the masala one. Both the dishes had about 4-5 pieces only
. The chicken masala had a weird taste and was too oily.
Very average food for the price that they charge."
Excellent food. The drums of heaven were truly heavenly!!
Keep up the good work
"Ordered for my wife in Thane. She liked it a lot.
Thank you guys."
testy food
Great food..
good
Too much masala in the biryani. Kills the appetite
oily food
Best Goan spreadüòã
Food was Good it would have better if tandoori was served with Green chutney.
not cooked properly and on top of that who gives stale onion
rotis were half cooked.sabji was not good.its taste was really bad
yumm
very bad food quality. could not ste it.
Food delivered was really good with a very good quantity .Will be glad to visit the place too.
keep up the good work!
"Good taste, reasonable prices. Order quite a lot from here."
I ordered for first time from here and it was really great. First it was delivered very fast. I ordered butter chicken and chicken tawa masala from their menu. The quality and quantity was good enough for 3 people. Butter chicken was really nice and hot but I like bit spicy. And chicken tawa masala it was really great chicken was perfectly cooked. Both the dishes are great I will order again.
"We ordered food from here for dinner and must say, it‚Äôs really good. A perfect blend of coastal flavours.
Chicken masala gravy is a must try !
The veg kohlapuri was tooo spicy for my palate.

Food 5/5"
food quality was lil low men....kitna masala tha like i ordered fuh 235 n i get just 2 chicken piece
best quality and quantity. and deliverd before estimate time. quick delivery. A big thumps up... keep it up
I was forced to cancel my order by restaurant when I was reluctant the restaurant had to deliver the order but it was delivered very late. It's humiliating that when you are hungry and don't get the food on time.
worst butter chicken ever
"Food tasted absolutely fine!
delivery took very long, if you want to order consider 1.5Hrs in advance."
