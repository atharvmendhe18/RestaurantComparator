Wrong food

Schezwan Fried rice was beyond spicy. The whole taste of the fried rice was spoilt because of extreme spice level
Too much garlic in panner chilly that too big pieces.
did NoT send spoon
"Ordered 2 plate masala pav and 1 plate pav bhaji. Received 1 plate masala pav 1 plate butter pav and 1 plate pav bhaji..
Zomato delivery w/o uniform.. no branding of relax in the cover or any of the packaging"

"The food was severely undercooked
And tastes awful"
