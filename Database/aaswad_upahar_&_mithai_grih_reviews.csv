Review
"Was always on my list to visit this place. Heard a lot from my SP colleagues and friends.
Ordered
1) masala bath. Tasteless dry. Not worth.
2) Aamras puri. Good. More than Acceptable aamras. But was very sweet.
3). Misal. I can say was ok. There are many places which offer better misal than them.
Overall i can say that places like these who earned name, is not upto the standards. May be way back when it was established there were no competitors to their taste.
Not worth a visit."

"Best Maharstrian cuisine in the heart of mumbai. Once you taste the food the wait to enter the restaurant will be worth. Must try.
We tried Puri Bhaji and Veg Thali"
"After seeing so many videos of this restaurant off late ü§£ decided to try it out. So we ordered 5 items
1. Misal Pav - staying in Maharashtra for last 11 years and eating it for the first time was an eye opener that how and why didn‚Äôt I eat it till now - 5*
2. Sabudana Vada - little overrated - 3*
3. Dahi Vada - very different, curd was sour and they try to balance this with extra sugar - 3*
4. Thalipeeth - Nice dish with white butter - 4*
5. Masala Bhat - Average - 3*
Super fast service and true value for money. Just Rs.441 for all these items üòä
Overall a üëç experience"

"The restaurant serves Marathi cuisine, and have all types of food which you can have breakfast to dinner . We were there for Breakfast and had a good selection of food from pooran poli to aamras pori to wada pav, to thalipeet.
Food was quick and tasty, they also serve Chinese and south indian cuisine. They undertake delivery and catering orders as well.
Just next to the restaurant there is a sweet shop where you can take away some lovely sweets to moodaks .
Over all quite good food and filling."
