"These idiots told me there‚Äôs an offer on bira white and bira strong as a pitcher for 999.

When ordered a pitcher of bira strong, they gave me bira white. Any beer lover knows a peculiar taste of a bira white to have an orange tangy taste whereas the strong has a peculiar taste known to beer lovers.

They‚Äôre trying to cheat is the problem. Not the cost or something but deceiving the customers is what i feel isn‚Äôt needed

The manager came and argued about it being a bira strong. Giving all logic-less excusess, trying to save their own reputation for their own act of cheating.

"Great Place, Stumbled upon this place to binge a beer. Food is good, service is top notch. Lookout for Suresh & Ajay for your assistance. Awesome place."
"Pathetic experience, mannerless waiters and below par food quality. The staff doesn't have the basic manners to talk to customers. A road side Chinese stall gives a much better customer service compared to these people."
"This is the worst restaurant you can visit.We order 3 dishes n it took more then 1 hour 45minutes to bring the 2 dish and we have to cancel the 3,rd dish.the service was so slow and the food was so bland.there was only 2 waiters and they juggling so hard.the restaurant was not even full and the amount of time they were taking thts too much and the quantity was so less.I ll never suggest someone to visit here"

This place has got indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangement. The food quality is not good. Service is quite slow. Place is full during evenings.
This place remains crowded during evenings. The outside seating area which is an open air space is always packed during evenings. The food quality is not worth but this place is good for some drinks options. The service is cordial. Minimalistic ambiance.
Great place to hangout. Good service and good food. Tried out some prawns and chicken. A nice place to go after a work day. Some background music would have added a nice extra.

Good and simple ambience.

This was my first visit after the redo. I don't see any major changes in terms of the looks of the restaurant but the place looks more clean n tidy ( unlike before).

The food quality and taste has improved a lot....the prices has been increased but it's worth the quality.
I still think this place is way to pocket friendly as compared to other restuarants.

The service is also good...

Went to hot spot on wed ( 20-mar-2018). First time post renovation. Really really disappointed the standard of service has dipped drastically. Really poor service. Left the place eating chakli. Really disappointed. Hope the owners work on it as it used to be an amazing place
