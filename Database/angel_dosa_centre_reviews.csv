Review
I went to this place with high expectations but it took just one bite of dosa to crush it. Someone please teach them how to a prepare good quality dosa. Never had such a pathetic sambhar and chutney in my entire life. I urge everyone who is reading my review to think twice before visiting this place. Didn't understand why the prices are so high considering the fact that the ambience is bad and nothing is great about that place. Never visiting this place again even if someone gives me free food to eat
"Bad ... Unhygienic place, unhygienic staff ,bad service, dirty waiters n tables, no option of even washing your hands before or after eating. N highly over priced...if i m paying 400 rs fr one dosa I expect quality n hygeine n clean staff"
"This joint in our locality was once a go-to place for evening snacks. But over the last few years, this place has consistently degraded its quality with increase in price. Also, service is pathetic. It usually takes very long for the waiter to come even for a spoon or anything."
"This place was on my list of places to visit since a long time. We wanted to try the Burj Khalifa dosa, after seeing its size we were unsure of finishing it. It was loaded with cheese and very tasty. For ‚Çπ400 it was good. Obviously we took some parcel."

Tried cheese nugget dosa at this place. It was very tasty and fulfilling. Adequate for 3 people. Would definitely visit again.
"There was so much hype about Angel Dosa Centre's 'Bhurj Khalifa Dosa'..that I had to try it. I must say that it is worth the hype. This was the tallest dosa I had ever seen in my life..with three layers of filling. It has got veggies, noodles, sauces and oodles of cheese. You definitely need 3 people to finish this gigantic dosa. So if it's ok for you to spend Rs 400 over a dosa, then go for this one. You won't regret it."
Angel dose is in thane. This place has various dosa options. It's full filling as well. Quite heavy .
"One of the favorites of Thane people. They have so many varieties of dosa.
We had tried the best seller ""Burj Khalifa Dosa""
Unfortunately the dosa fell while the person was bringing it but then they had made another one for us.

Ambience: 3/5
Food Taste: 4/5
Quantity: 3.5/5
Quality: 3.5/5"
"Finally tried the Burj Khalifa dosa from here , the Internet trending dosa of all time , taste was good , but could have been more better , presentation is nice , the dosa was for 400 ‚Çπ , would have been better if it was a little less than that ."
"Had Burj khalifa dosa.
Good in taste,
Too overloaded with cheese.
If you are cheese lover then you will surely like this.
Chutney is well spicy and tasty.
Highly recommended."
"The quality is so bad, and the staff is so unhygienic. The owner is rude as hell. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The dosa was like rubber and the pav bhaji dosa concept is so weird I rather go have pav bhaji somewhere instead of having that dosa. Don‚Äôt go there!"
Not hygienic place at all. No proper cleaning of tables and floor. No hand sanitizer. Not expected when you charge so much for the food.
"Angel Dosa in Thane is a good place to try and get your hands on variety of Dosa's trending as ""Cheese Bursts"" being enjoyed by many.
.
This place is developing manifolds since it's inception. They've recently renovated, has got indoor and outdoor seating capacities.
.
The place has good Dosa's to offer but over a period of time the quantity, stuffing, filling is decreasing and prices are increased.
.
One literally has to wait or call out many times if any add on like chutney, sambhar is needed. With these cheese burst trends one can't anyway expect a proper delish south indian chutney and sambhar so they're average in taste. Order takes alot of time to come on table.

Quite comfortable seating arrangement.
Taste and quantity is at top . Both perfect.

"One of the worst Dosas I have had in Mumbai. Hearing good reviews I visited the place to try Jini Dosa, Burj Khalifa dosa, Chutney Dosa, Pav Bhaji dosa.

Jini Dosa was no where near to the taste we get at ghatkopar...


The batter they use is a issue. The dosa dont turn crispy and become like Stretchy Naan in 5 mins.
Usage of Maida, Rice Flour was very evident.

The masala's stuffing was okayish. They try to compensate everything with double quantity butter.

In all its a not to waste money place....."
"My honest opinion for this is ...The Place is just over hyped..especially about its Burj Khalifa Dosa.
The fact is due to over amount of cheese and inappropriate filling..its doesn't even taste good..
Yes ..the presentation is quite unique..which grabs attention of a lot of people..but after all it is supposed to taste good...
Secondly..very over priced..i e 400 for this is a waste of money..
Coming to the filling..the Dosa must have Potato bhaji as a base..atleast but no.. they have paneee and noodles filling..which is not liked by everyone..soo here recipe developer must take care..
Lastly their cheese really don't taste good.. very disappointing..i found it to be much saltier..

We ordered Ginny and starter dosa.. both were cheesy. For Ginny taste was good but quantity of gravy was not enough. And for starter dosa I can say ok ok... apart from cheese didn't get any other taste from gravy.
"*ANGEL DOSA CENTER*
Started in 2010, this place is in Thane and has a variety of dosa.

I tried *BURJ KHALIFA DOSA* which is pile of rolled dosa. Taste is ok, price is little high. They put so much cheese that it loses its taste. Chatni and Sambhar is average.

Cleanliness is maintained and quality is good too, sitting arrangements is also good.
Overall I'll give 3‚Ä¢5 stars üåü to ANGEL DOSA CENTER

"It's was not that good. I expected it to very tasty, but it was okay and it is very very very over rated. Like 400Rs for one dosa. It was not worth at all.. Very disappointing. Moreover, the person there sells you the duplicate water bottles. Very disappointing.."
Best place to eat dosas! I had this burj khalifa dosa which was huge and absolutely delicious full of flavours and filled with cheese! Highly recommend! Love the food here‚ù§ do try it!!!
"This review is strictly of just this one dosa that we had at the Angel Dosa Centre i.e., the Burj Khalifa Dosa.

BURJ KHALIFA DOSA-
It is made up of three layers, the upper most layer consist of one rolled up dosa, which is filled with just their special masala.
The second layer is made up of 2-3 rolled up dosas and has a noodle filling it is which honestly, tasted divine!
The lower most layer of rolled up dosas are filled with manchurian balls which is just a bonus!
They also give a separate bowl of their special filling which is really delicious!

The place is a bit less comfortable considering the fact that it is usually crowded so you gotta sit at the tables they have outside.

"Recently I visited this place and had an amazing experience by trying their famous Burj Khalifa Dosa.
As it's name suggests, this Dosa is rolled and stacked like a tower and served with lot of melted cheese on top.
This was the yummiest and the heaviest Dosa I have ever had and that too with a great presentation.
The ambience of the place is also good after the renovation.
Overall a good experience.
5/5"
"Angel dosa is very famous outlet located at Khopat in Thane. It serves more than 50 varieties of dosa and i have visited this place many times.

Recently visited this place to try their Burj Khalifa dosa. This dosa is made by stacking Paneer dosa and Chinese
dosa on each other. This dosa contains paneer, noodles,manchurian, liquid cheese and is fully loaded. It was a very deliciously huge dosa and you need atleast 2 people to finish it. It is definitely a must must try!

My other personal favorites here are Jini dosa and chutney powder dosa. So overall its an awesome place to try cheesy and delicious dosas, but i feel their seating area and service does needs to be improved.

"Angel dosa was suggested by my friend and it's worth more than what he described. As of now it's renovating a bit so you might find the place little mess, but I guarantee you the food will make you feel like heaven. Cheese Maggi dosa was one of the best I had. Taste buds savoured every aspect of its flavour. Worth every penny you spend not even a bit of a regret. Will definitely recommend"
"The dream dosa one must give a try. The dosa was completely awsome. Value for money
The only thing i was disappointed with was the noise n work going on in the ambiance. A lot of dust was there because of it"
I found out about this place recently. I was really hungry and wanted to take a bite into some delicious dosa and then when I found this place I was not disappointed at all. Their sambhar and chatni are so yum and their dosa's are tasty and buttery. Yet have to try their varieties of dosa as I've heard a lot about this place.

"Angel dosa center is one of the famous dosa seller with more than 50 variety of Dosa's. All of their Dosa are a value for money as they are at an affordable price with an excellent taste, for cheese lovers they have a special menu out of best is Cheese burst Dosa. Ambience is no that good."

"Hey Guys, Its a tower dosa fully loaded with cheese. The concept is taken from the tallest tower in world burj khalifa and named it as burj khalifa dosa. Do watch the review at below youtube link

"For years, i was unaware of this place though it's in vicinity of my residence.. the place is currently under renovation so you may get confused.. but the serve really amazing and wide variety of dosas.. the specialty of this place is 'Burj Khalifa dosa' and 'Gini Dosa'.. i am very much sure that on a normal day you cannot finish Burj without someone's help.. the taste is spot on.. you must also try Kerala masala dosa, Pav bhaji dosa and Manchurian dosa.. after eating with pleasure, your pocket also won't feel sorry.. kudos to the team.!!"
"Angel Dosa Centre is one of those places that solely are famous because of the food and nothing else. To say that place has an ambience alone would be an overstatement. To be fair though, the place was even worse before say few months ago. There was not even a seating arrangement. Since then they have upgraded the place a bit. Nevertheless the place is still jam packed due to its food."
"üòä- Angel Dosa Centre

On weekend i went here Angel dosa..Very difficult to find as it is very small place with small sitting area.. Currently Stall is under renovation so it was my bad experience. Dust on Table & Chair,Dosa stand they have kept outside of the stall.

So,Now above taste & food ...it is very famous for Bhurj Khalifa dosa. I also went to eat this dosa only..I ordered Bhurj Khalifa Dosa Rs.390/-.. Heavy dosa one person can't finish this dosa..2-3 ppl can finish dosa..chatni sambhar taste was ok.Dosa taste was ok..

"not as expected or what i had in mind it would look like
quiet a ordinary restaurant with irregular table seating arrangement
no aesthetic at all and no feeling of any kind of ambiance
open cooking so may be chances of dust and dirt in food probably high
but the taste of thi Burg Khalifa Dosa wa Extremely good
its made of two dosas one with noodle inside and the other one with some kind of masala and each dosa roll has a manchurian slice
it is then placed in a way to like that building of burg khalifa
dosa is heavy enough to satisfy 2-3 people satisfactorily
it has got really best taste and one has gotta try this for the taste üòã"
"Given the hype , we decided to give a try to the BURJ KHALIFA DOSA at Angel Dosa, Thane. This place is located near Viviana Mall in Panch Pakhadi naka.
There's nothing to talk about the Ambience and seatings as it's very ordinary. The place was under renovation when we visited. So possibly better days await for the place in terms of appearance.
As the cooking was done out in the open, i cannot guarantee about the hygiene. The hygiene standards are as bad as any thela you can find anywhere.

Angle dosa center is located in khopat. I love the mysoor dosa available here. A must visit place for South Indian food.
Absolutely loved the dosas! The prices are high as compared to other places but definitely worth it. The variety is good and taste is awesome! I tried their Cheese Mysore Masala Dosa and Cheese Masala Wafers Dosa.
"Amazing place located in Thane near Flower Valley.
Serves the best quality of Dosa with Price Worthy Quantity.

If u are cheese lover

1st is cheese mysore masala dosa and 2nd is cheese burst masala dosa
Both were chess game....üòçüòä"

"Overall food was good, i tried bhurj khaleefa dosa which was very good, quality was so good, i was fully stuffed with cheese and nuddles. Shop was under Maintenance so it wasn't clean it all. Staff is quite shabby ."
"I had burj khalifa dosa which was fantastic in taste, appearance, quality of food and even in quantity according to price(as it was for 390rs). It had 3 layers which actually made it look complete like a building of burj khalifa, i really loved it in every aspect.
But i have just one issue that was with ambiance, which should be more better, people come from far places to just have this kind of good food, so i think they deserve to sit in nice place too.
Apart form sitting and ambiance, food was just yummmmm.....

I don‚Äôt know who named this dosa as Burj Khalifa Dosa but honestly the name says it all. This dosa was literally cheesy, buttery and stuffed with veggies. Loved the taste. Would recommend you try this one!

Two people can easily get their stomach full with as the quantity is enough for two.

"Okay so a lot of food bloggers recommended the bhurj khalifa dosa. To start with the price is 320. One single person cannot complete the dosa. So the taste had different layers. And the cream of cheese made the dosa more heavy.
The cheese burst maggi dosa is specially for the people who love maggi. But obviously it tasted decent. The taste however could be more amazing. Is my personal feedback.

"One of the best dosas I have tasted! This place is near Viviana mall, opposite runwal nagar and it's currently under Renovation but the best part is they are still serving and is always crowded. Must try paneer cheese chilly dosa! It's fingerlicking good!!"

A tempting dish which you can resist. However it cannot be finished by one person alone so think before ordering two üòÇ

The staff was very nice
Just a little disappointed with the sitting arrangements.. apart from that it was the best experience

"You find only good dosas here for sure .have tried few they taste similar just that they have alongated the menu for no reason, however taste is good for sure don't go with menu it looks big but tastes same ."
"One of the famous dosa centre in thane.
Place is flooded with people in evening.
Interesting thing is that they have worked over their menu so nicely that different types of dosas are easy to find and differentiate.

I tried cheese chinese masala dosa.
Coconut chutney is good and samabar is little different than usual.

Burj khalifa dosa is a famous dish over here."
Never ever tried such an amazing dosa in life. The quantity and quality are just out off words to describe and it have reasonable price also. The food and service are worthy must visit this place. Highly recommended.
Angel dosa was totally different thing back then. And now the taste has changed a lot. It has come up with lot of variations and all but the taste isn‚Äôt so impressive anymore and the dosas are particularly very oily which I personally dislike to a great extent
"Literally the best Dosas I had ever had , Not even had such varieties of Dosas when I visited south India , this place is a must visit for the taste and the quantity , a dosa may become a meal and can leave you fully packed with taste"
"One of my fav dosa wala in thane. They have a wide menu for you to choose for dosa, uttapas and etc. the taste of the place is much wow! It is just located opp runwal nagar. The hygiene of the place is not that good but the taste out beats it, order a dosa and eat in your car to suffice your hunger pangs. They also serve some fancy dosas like Burj Khalifa dosa, pasta dosa. French fries dosa, cheese burst Maggie dosa etc. The pizza Uttapa and gini dosa is a must tryüòã"
This place is situated on the opposite side of viviana in runwal nagar. One of my favourite dosa wala in thane. They serve best dosas in city. Gini dosa is special dosa.
"This place has a variety of dosa options to choose from, more than 50 for sure! From your regular dosas to fancy ones like ice cream dosa and lays dosa, you will find it all here. I was starving and decided to stick to the savoury ones only. The ones I tried are:
1) Paneer Cheese Mysore Dosa
2) Manchurian Dosa
3) Paneer Burji Dosa
4) Onion Uthappa
5) Mysore Masala Dosa
6) Sada Dosa

My personal favorite out of the lot was the paneer cheese Mysore Dosa, but that lacked some salt too. I would suggest you get your ""bhaaji"" personalized to meet your taste by asking them to add more salt/ chilli. Dosa is crisp and cooked to perfection.

We had a literal foodporn here.
Firstly there is no so called luxury interior or ambiance of this place. It‚Äôs as basic as any fast food roadside stall.
They have a very limited seating area.
But the service and detailing of various types of dosa is a complete 5 star.
I loved eating dosa here and it satisfied my cravings.
At some point the management successfully handles the hygiene of the food preps.
Overall a satisfactory experience for eating."
"Angel dosa started as a roadside shack and now is shifted to a full fledged shop! Though Ambience is not that great, the Dosas are. They have many variety of Dosas and each and everyone is wonderful!

This outlet is hard to miss as u can see a full assembly of Dosa Pans aligned up for serving the crowd!

A very big fan of this place jst fr a reason of having mindblowing variety which turns a simple dosa into some unique dish
U also get uttappam here .
Its a small place doesn't have a proper ambience but wen u have such an awesome dosa in front of u den u tend to forget everything and jst get blend with the taste !!
Overall 4/5‚òÜ
My favourite cheese burst and spcl. Ginny dosa !!"
"First and foremost the most expensive dosa in whole Mumbai and it's not even worth trying. Never visit this place , the chutney was below average and the sambhar is the worst I ever had in Mumbai or even Thane. The Uttapam served was uncooked and even the Dosa. Very overrated by people. Those people who understand and know the real taste should not visit. Yes if you like loads of Butter and cheese and taste is not a factor for you then you can waste your money. Instead go for roadside Dosa in Naupada/Panchpakhadi which is totally worth it and will save your money too."
"It is my favourite place for dosa's, serving all kinds and variants of dosa's from the traditional masala dosa to fusion dosa's all at affordable prices.
They make sure that you don't need to wait for long for your favourite dosa's.
They don't have a proper seating arrangement, but when you have yummy food in front of you, who cares?
You should definitely visit this place once.

The place is quite small bt this is one of the best place for quick bite..dosa lover should definitely visit this place..you will get all type of dosa you want..i love manchurian dosa here..it is a must try..love to visit again this place
The dosas are very tasty but it's the dirtiest restaurant I have been to. Check the pics. Un-Hygienic food off course. If they work on cleanliness it will be a good match
