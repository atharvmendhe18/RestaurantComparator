Review
"Lovely ambience, subtle music and good food (and deserts - special mention; Signature Hot chocolate).. We had a lively evening and the caterer, Sudhanshu was really friendly & professional."
Food quality is not worth the price.
Such expensive pizza and very small portions

"Great time at Grandmama's cafe, Juhu with my daughter.

The food was amazing. One of the best meals I have had lately.

The butter garlic prawns and the avocado toast was simply the best.

My kids love the Burrata Pizza and the fresh juices they had to offer.

Also the hot chocolate with marshmallows was a great hit.

The service was impeccable by Sudhanshu and Prabhat

Also the Grandmama's cafe has been revamped by the incredibly talented Gauri Khan.
The interiors are aesthetically pleasing and love the vibe
Must visit!"
"Pizza had so strong truffle smell...suppressed all other cheese mushroom taste ans Rissotto was extremely watery and bit bland. Hummus, Falafel and Pita were amazing, especially lived their drinks..too perfect"
"The service is so shit, we had to wait insane time for the food and even more time to even get the bill. It doesnt even make sense that they charge a 7% for service when they dont even have people attending properly."
Too oily food. It was like drinking oil. No chicken in the penne pasta. Only the pizza was good
"Worst experience, went for my daughters second birthday, the food was stale and very bad taste, plus there are speakers right above our table and we requested 5 times to lower down the volume, eveytime they used to adhere to the request and again make it loud, the manager is very rude and the staff is also not great. After this feedback too they put a service charge on the bill, when we didnt even complete the food and wanted to just walk off, they say its compulsory and didnt care about the official rule... how have the mighty fallen, never would recommend this place"
"Pathetic food, we had harissa chicken skewers it was bland, we had ordered mango passion iced tea it tasted like diluted slice ,and in wild mashroom risotto rice was under cooked and no cheese at all"

"Salad is only full of leaves. No walnuts, only 2 pieces of beetrrot and orange"
Excellent Like Always

Sugar sachet wasn‚Äôt given

gr8 hospitality
Has called for spaghetti and meat balls along with other items. The meat balls were uncooked and hard.

Very good food. Extremely satisfied.
"If you're used to their original ambience then the current setting is an eyesore.

But thankfully a lot of things are still right, including the flavours in the food and the attentive service.

The menu has undergone a massive overhaul over the years. But a lot of my comfort food including the breakfast selections and the Italian mains still remain. The sandwich options are completely disappointing overall, which I would love if they could revive.

During today's visit there were 2 occassions where something I'd ordered came back from the kitchen as unavailable, making it harder to balance a cheesy and filling Italian meal with as I couldn't think of switching to Indian or Chinese mid...read more"
"Disastrous Valentine's Dinner Experience at Grandmama's Cafe - Juhu


I had the misfortune of choosing Grandmama's Cafe for Valentine's dinner with my girlfriend, and it turned out to be a nightmare from start to finish. Despite having a reservation, we were made to wait for 30 minutes before being seated. The service was abysmal, with the waiter taking ages to even acknowledge us, let alone take our order.

When we finally managed to order cocktails (Anti ageing Caprieoska and Kamikaze), it took an eternity for them to arrive, and the quality was mediocre at best. The waiter conveniently ""forgot"" to inform us about the 1+1 offer, only mentioning it when we asked the manager for...read more"
"Chicken is completely raw, unavle to eat, absolute waste of money"

"It was extremely unpleasant, the ghee/oil was floating on top like hell. Worst experience"
chicken shawarma was not clearly described neither did it tast anything like a chicken shawarma

Saturday evening and you don‚Äôt get 2 out of 4 dishes that you want to order . Worst is they are not even apologetic and wanting to suggest options . It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ your choice u want to have or you want to go . So we left
Food is not good we had king pao potatoes it was utterly disgusting and beg momos were given from the frozen packet for sure as it was not looking fresh at all
after ordering had called venue for some requirement but unfortunately no one picked and also no revert back....called 3 times.

Did not follow instructions

"They didn't deliver half the order only gave one part of the order,quite disappointed."
Not at all tasty.
Great experience on Delivery service
roti se patla pizza
"The Grandmama special pizza was a true taste of comfort and tradition! Laden with a generous variety of toppings, to fresh veggies, each bite was a flavorful journey. The combination of flavors was reminiscent of homemade cooking, and the crust had just the right amount of chewiness. Whether you're a fan of classic pizzas or looking to try something new, the Grandmama special is sure to satisfy your cravings for a hearty and delicious meal."
"This is not roast chicken, whatever it is, it‚Äôs undercooked. I would not risk eating it. Vegetables look to be soggy. Grandma needs to read a cookery book.. not fit for purpose will be requesting a full refund and they can take this rubbish back."

I asked for no onion and no Garlic and the pasta was filled with Garlic

""
Portion size was less for a full bowl of soup

"Burger was good in taste, packaging was done good, bun was fresh and well cooked by the restaurant,I was fully satisfied with the taste of the food.

surely reccomend."
It had burnt particles in it:( . Really disappointed

"I had visited Grandmama‚Äôs Cafe Juhu on my birthday recently. The food we ordered was delicious. The quantity and quality of food was top notch. Had a lovely brunch at this place. Would totally recommend.

Delicacies we enjoyed :

1) Creamy mushroom and Chicken dumpling Soup
2) Buffalo Chicken Wings
3) Buffalo style chicken pizza
4) Shepherd‚Äôs Pie
5) Caramel Cheesecake"
chickpeas were extra crunchy. they are supposed to be cooked soft not crunch
Very disappointed...then quantity of hot chocolate was very less. not even full glass it was. It was just little more than half cup...in restaurant they give good quantity but in parcel it was not that much...as if it was fooling..i want full refund

The pasta was too sweet
"Good food
great ambiance
the staff is good"
packaging was bad
The pasta was good but roast chicken was horrible
"The coffee did not feel like authentic cold coffee, it wasn‚Äôt thick at all, as it should‚Äôve been."
There were garlic peels in the M&C

"The food in this restaurant was absolutely pathetic. I visited this restaurant about 3 years ago and the food was amazing but now that‚Äôs really not the case. I ordered masala fries, chicken wings, grandmama‚Äôs signature hot chocolate and a chicken pizza. The fries and wings were absolutely drowning in SALT and they tasted so bad it was borderline unbelievable. The pizza looked and tasted like something you can make in your microwave at home by using a ready made base and the hot chocolate was the most overhyped thing I‚Äôve come across in a while because it tasted like Bournvita mixed in hot milk. Absolutely disappointed. I can‚Äôt believe that food in a restaurant of this stature can...read more"
Very Nice
"The hot chocolate was soo indulgent.. so thick, chocolaty.. soul fulfilling.. we were licking its remains from the empty cup. Absolutely worth it. ü§§ü§§ü§§"
"I had a delightful experience at this small cafe with a cozy vibe. The pizza was delicious, and the hot chocolate is a must-try for anyone visiting. The pasta also lived up to expectations, and every other dish I tried was equally satisfying. A definite recommendation for those who appreciate good food in a welcoming atmosphere!"
"Amazing experience always with the food, ambience & service especially by Mr Sudhanshu & the Manager
it's a must visit place for all ages !!"
"The food taste was stale
The salted caramel tasted really sour. Highly disappointed!"
Taste of my laksa noodle soup was good but noodles were not cooked well.
"Chicken broth dumplings soup was sour it had too much viniger in it had to return it.
Chicken strogonof had too much wine taste in it, the wine was not reduced, hence overpowered the dish.
The time taken to serve was more than an hour... the kitchen was slow in bringing out the dishes"
