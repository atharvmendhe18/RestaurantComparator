"Swadam Bhog never fails to amaze with their delicious food.
Not only the taste...but they also take care of the valuable time of customers by delivering on time."

"the paneer had been made from burnt milk, it tasted awful"
"It's an amazing place to have pure veg delicacies.
The elaborated menu gives you a wide range of cuisines to choose from. Must visit to hang out with friends at brunch and suppers."

"Excellent food quality, unique taste and reasonable price. Despite such fabulous food, the place is not crowded. Very under rated place. The only issue is slow service (takes a lot of time to receive the order) but it might be because they serve freshly cooked food. In our past few visits, we tried sizzler, paneer kathi roll, moon moon, paneer Hunan sauce etc, everything was awesome. Be it quality or taste. It's a must try place.

Disclaimer - people who are impatient might get disappointed with the pace at which food is cooked and served but in terms of taste and quality i am sure it wont disappoint anyone."

Extremely disappointed with the service. Was there at the restaurant for 70 mins and only ended up with mediocre soups. Was looking forward for some good Indian dishes but the slow service and there was no expectation setting with us that there would be delays.
please use a little less oil to fry the bhature if not the taste is perfect

@swadambhog is a place where you should head to and enjoy their veg food.

They serve wide variety indian, punjabi and Chinese food. Their ambiance is so damn cool. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangement. We get such a good vibes. Their service is also fast and their staff is also super polite. I would surely like to visit here again.

"Hey guys, just been to this amazing Pure Veg Restaurant Swadam Bhog, Amazing Food, Perfect Ambience, Very humble Staff. A perfect place to have your Lunch/Dinner."
"Recently visited this amazing place. Its an pure veg restaurant. They serves the best vegetarian food.
So I had tried :
1.)Shyaam sawere with masala roti
2.)Potato chilly dry
3.)Sarso ka phool

All the three items were amazing in taste. Potato chilly dry is my personal favourite. It was very crispy nd perfectly made.
Sarso ka phool is an cauliflower dish, served as starter.
Shyaam sawere with masala roti was delicious too. It has paneer kofta in it.
Overall had an amazing experience.
Recommended."

"A small restaurant with 6 tables - but let me tell you, if you are vegetarian and living in borivali - this is a must visit place. I am in love with this restaurant- the ambience or the food both are something that makes you in awe of this place. I have been here so many times in the small time this restaurant has started.
What i love here is the punjabi food. Must try is Chilly Mili sabzi it is SB Special dish. It is finger lickin good.
Try Amritsari kulcha or the paneer cheese kulcha.
You get authentic punjabi food. And the host themself as so so good. Must visit for vegetarians"
