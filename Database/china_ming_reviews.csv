"China Ming in Goregaon delivers an exceptional Asian fusion experience. The sushi was fresh and flavorful, while the Thai curry was a taste of Bangkok's streets. The katsu was crispy outside and tender inside, a true delight. Vegetarians will love the perfectly seasoned tofu dish. The drinks menu offers a variety to suit every taste. With impeccable service and a vibrant ambiance, China Ming stands out. Highly recommended for a memorable dining experience!"

They have a Great Selection in Cocktails & Mocktails that are Super Refreshing. In Mains, we tried the best Thai curry in Mumbai, hands down. And the Caramel Custard here needs no introduction. Visit China Ming Now for an Unforgettable Time!"
"China ming restaurant is a hidden gem! I had an incredible meal there. The asparagus sushi and chilli garlic prawns were mouthwatering. The burnt garlic fried rice with mix vegetable gravy was a perfect combination of flavors. And let's not forget the amazing mocktails, especially the carribbean mango and dancing lady. The caramel custard and ice-cream with honey noodles were the perfect way to end the meal. The service was top-notch, and the ambiance was lovely. I highly recommend this place for a delicious dining experience!"

"disinterested restaurant staff, seating is cluttered and tightly spaced occasionally people and servers bumping to them. Food is decent, waiters generally discourage you from ordering Sushi, taste is decent certainly not a restaurant to command a premium price tag."

"This place used to be good but recently has become more like a fast food joint- with some tables getting served lot faster and others being totally ignored. Even after doing a reservation for a table we had to wait for 20-30 minutes as they were catering to a group. I guess that meant even super slow service- it took another 15 minutes for someone to come over to our order. Hope the management focuses on ambiance and quality service rather than bulk group service, would have rather expected restaurant to call and let us know that they are occupied in such instances then coming to restaurant and then have to wait and subject to poor service. This was unacceptable experience and for sure...read more"

"I recently dined at China Ming, a fantastic restaurant located in the Hub Mall, Goregaon. The culinary experience here is truly a treat for Asian cuisine enthusiasts. From Chinese and sushi to delectable seafood, the menu offers a delightful range.

We started with the Peppery BBQ Cottage Cheese, which was incredibly delicious, featuring soft and flavorful cheese. The Tangy Vegetables in Hot Chilli Sauce, a spicy and tangy gravy, was a hit. Pairing it with the Malaysian flat noodles made for an excellent combination.

For drinks, we savored their special mocktails, 'Death by Chocolate' and 'Incredible Seduction.' I particularly loved 'Death by Chocolate' for its unique and delightful...read more"

"""OMG, China Ming in Goregaon was lit! üôåüèºüî• I had the most amazing time there! The mocktails were super refreshing, and the Devil Chilli Chicken had just the right amount of spice. The Shanghai Chicken Dimsum was like little pockets of yumminess, and the Prawns in Hunan Sauce were so flavorful. The Flat Malaysian Noodles were on point, and the Honey Noodles with Ice Cream and Caramel Custard for dessert were the perfect sweet ending. The food, the vibe, everything was just perfect! Can't wait to go back for more foodie adventures there! üçΩÔ∏èüòç"""

"The staff here is only interested in doing upselling of the food and the dish suggested by them is the worst. they have kept pocket friendly dish outside the menu and when you ask for those they will say we have only kept costly items to make more sale. Even the costliest of the items here is so pathetic in taste and portion.

Not going again for sure next time, had been a regular customer"
the order was not packed properly.. had no zomato tape on it and the entire rice spilled in the pack

"It was my life‚Äôs worst Chinese food! It was stale, weird and pathetic in taste. It was a clear waste of INR600"
"I must say it has become one of our favourite stops for asian cuisine. Especially we simply visit it for having only Sushi and dumplings
We had randomly stumbled across this after watching a movie in Hub mall Goregaon East.
We were hungry and craving for Pan Asian cuisine and luckily we saw China Ming just a floor below the cinema hall.
Immediately went for it and my god , it was a decision well taken.
Excellent and delicious food, no doubt. We are regulars now.

Items we regularly order :

1. Philadelphia Cheese Sushi
2. jalape√±os and cheese Sushi
3. Crystal veg dumplings"
"China Ming, an Asian Bistro in Goregaon is known for its authentic pan asian cuisine.
We tried their Virgin Blue Lagoon and Red Roger mocktails, Philly Cheese Rolls, Edamame Truffle Dimsums, Thai Green Curry Ghankheaw Wan, Khao Phad Gaprao and Honey Noodles With Icecream.
The experience was quite unique, and the ambience is good enough for a relaxed date.
So if you want to try some chinese, thai or japanese cuisine, chinamingbistro is the place for you."

"This asian restaurant has beautiful ambiance and yummy food paired with mesmerising mocktails
These are the dishes we tried:
1. Dancing Lady Mocktail- A refreshing sip of strawberry and litchi together
2. Virgin Mojito- Served in the fanciest way you would have ever seen
3. Asparagus Tempura Sushi- It was made so professionally and served very aesthetically on a ship with smoke which elevates its beauty! Sushis are a MUST TRY here!
4. Shanghai Chicken Dimsums- served in a bamboo box, Tastes yum
5. Nasi Goreng- not a big fan of it but you could give it a try!
6. Burnt Garlic Fried Rice- Delicious rice with juicy and tender pieces of chicken

"We visited China Ming on 21/06/2023. It's an incredible Asian restaurant. The ambience is simple yet charming, perfect for a relaxed dining experience. Their style of presenting is a treat to the eyes. Their Bento Box was extravagant. You can choose from the options as per your liking,it contained sticky rice /noodles, a salad, your choice of dumpling and sushi pieces, wasabi and ginger pickle, an appetizer and gravy. Each bite bursted with authentic Asian flavors. The drinks we ordered were Virgin Mojiito and Red Lagoon; unique and interesting way of serving and they're a nice palate cleanser. The desserts cannot be overlooked.We ordered the all time favorite Sizzling Brownie and Caramel...read more"
