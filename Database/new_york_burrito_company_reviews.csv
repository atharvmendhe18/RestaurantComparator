"The quantity of food was a joke, it was so so less. Definitely dissatisfied for the monies taken . Never ordering from here. I couldnâ€™t find the rice, there was barely any beans and avacado i had to look out for. Sour cream was not to be seen. Vegetables also limited. Literally needed a microscope to find the ingredients, horrible decision and complete waste of money. Will not recommend this to anyone. Ruined my Sunday dinner."

The food was stale.
yummy as always....

I had ordered large which is over rs 450/- but I really doubt the quantity .
""
"INSPITE OF TELLING THEM THE SIZE OF LARG & MEDIUM PORTIONS FOR THE SALAD IS THE SAME..
THEY CHARGE YOU FOR A LARGE AND GIVE YOU THE QUANTITY OF A MEDIUM...
AND I SAW THIS WITH MYSELF AT THE RESTAURANT... IMAGINE WHEN IT COMES TO US AT HOME WE WILL NEVER REALISE IT..
NOT HAPPY AT ALL"

"They have an outlet at terminal 2, where the lady refused to take the order just coz she did not have change. On top she is saying you can eat somewhere else.
Atleast train the staff on how to handle customers"

"Our experience at ordering from your restaurant was extremely sad. The counter staff were terribly rude and unwelcoming. To add to the frustration, they seemed preoccupied with entertaining other clients, leaving our call on hold. Additionally, our delivery was very delayed by almost 50 mins. Improved staff courtesy and prompt service are crucial for customer satisfaction."
good taste but v small portion size

the quality of the food has deteriorated drastically. Ordered for a Panner Bowl just got 2 pieces of panner. The qty of sauce was way too much which made the taste horrible.
