Review
"This place is managed by few elderly people. They only have an outdoor seating available. The price range is too good for the quality and the quantity they provide. The best on their menu was their chicken Mayo roll.
We also tried :
Chicken burger - 4/5
Chicken croquet - 3/5
Chicken Mayo roll - 10/5
Chicken lollypop - 4/5
Chocolate muffin - 3/5"
""
While the counter staff are polite and courteous. It is the person sitting at the cashier who is way too disrespectful and impolite. His constant grumbles put me off and the comments were uncalled for. I don’t think I’m visiting this outlet again.
The staff is pathetic.. they only attend females and are way too polite towards them.. and don’t give a shit about male customers.. always lurking after females … ..

Affordable place which serves good food. Must try their mayo roll & chicken hotdog. Also well known for the choco balls & other bakery food. They only accept cash so make sure you carry cash along. The outdoor seating is good & well maintained.
Very small joint with a lovely ambience. To eat in s courtyard with a lovely off street view os a taroty in India. The food is very teasonable sn pretty decent.. try the choco laxa cake is a .ust try and give the samosa a shot. Lovely owners sweet and courteous.

It’s 2021 ! Can we please accept credit cards or digital payments !! Not all of us carry hard cash around in a digital age….
"One of the best place in Bandra, good food reasonable rates. Small outside seating area. Mostly people take parcel. You must try chicken roll here, they are the best."

"The owner and people working there are rude and very biased. Just because we were students, he treated us very badly. We were two people standing in the queue, he told us to wait and called in the two ladies standing behind us. Nothing so great about the cafe. No proper seating arrangements. Unhygienic. They don't wear mask properly. And for the price the quantity is not satisfactory. There are other good bakeries in Bandra beside them."
"I like this place, but they need to keep up with the times. I specifically went there to place a bulk order, but had to walk away with nothing."
"This gem of a cafe has a beautiful variety of dishes. The chicken sandwiches, cutlets and chops were sooo tasty! I will be visiting again for sure!"
"Cafe Andora was one of my favourites to hang out during college days. From cutlets, to pattices and rolls and the lollypop to all the muffins and cupcakes I love it all. Great music, good company and delicious food is all you need. The pricing is very reasonable and the place is all the time packed with college kids."
"I cannot believe I did know about this place for so long!!!!
THIS ONE IS A GEM and so underrated!! 😢😢
It has sooo many varieties, you'll just be so confused.
The staff is soo polite and sweet!
And the food is absolutely LIPSMACKING and soo light on the pocket!

It's a highly recommended place cafe!!!"
"Loved their selection of freshly baked food.
It’s greaf for a quick takeaway or even if you are planning to have finger food at a house party."
"A small place opposite Andrews college known for its snacks.. have been here ever since i was a kid since it was around my school, hence tried almost everything..

Ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken chilly, mini chicken puff and mini chicken samosa..

The fried rice was tasty and a good portion for Rs 100.. even the chicken chilly was tasty..

The chicken samosa is my favorite.. nice and crispy with yummy khatta meetha kheema inside.. even the mini chicken puff was tasty.. and all so cheap..

Taste - 9/10
Price - 9.5/10"
"I have been to this place zillions of times and every time I have something different and love it
The shezwan chutney needs to win an award for the taste
Just the best
We had their cold coffee and it was bomb .com
They are so affordable and a mini snack place for all the bandra people"

What an authentic place - giving right food for the right price! Kudos to the owners for keeping everything so constant! Simply unrealistic!
"Great food! Loved sausage roll chicken croissant mini chicken roll chicken lollipop
Chicken fried rice chilli chicken! Highly recommended!"
"Down the Memory lane! 15 years! Visited this place after a good 15 years.. Seems like a lifetime. Things have changed drastically. Better space to sit, and ambience feels different. Food quality is good but ofcourse the prices is 4x now, yet at par with other bakers around. Had a chicken burger (3.5/5), mini hot dog (4.25/5). The roasted chicken looked great, would try it next time. Back in those days, their chicken fried rice were awesome at dirt cheap prices. Post 7.45pm there are discounts upto 25% on specific items - so that's a bonus."
"Cafe Andora is a small cafe in the lanes of bandra.. next to st Andrews college, this cafe has a very cosy, simple and homely vibes.. a nice place to have some yummy snacks at very reasonable prices..

Things I've tried:

1) chicken mayo roll - this is available in a mini version too.. tasty mayo with small pieces of chicken in a roll..the mayo was very tasty and the roll was very soft and fresh..

2) chicken lollipop - crispy chicken lollipop cooked to perfection!

3) fried rice and manchurian gravy - this is my favorite combo of this place.. tasty fried rice with a spicy and yummy manchurian gravy.. if that was not enough, the Schezwan sauce at this place is a killer!

4) chicken...read more"

"This place was recommended by my friend also an alumni of St. Andrews college. It has a special place for all students studying or have studied in the college. This place located just opposite to the college has a cozy ambience for around 15-20 people to accomodate in.
You need to place the order at the counter and collect it and find a place to sit (all by yourself).

In frame - Chicken chilly roll

1) Chicken chilly roll- (4/5) This roll was scrumptious as it had generous amount of chicken pieces and tossed in chicken chilly sauce. The bread was fresh and soft. A must try.😊👍🏻

A lovely place to sit and enjoy your food. Very friendly staff. Love the environment here. Good food too. Mostly young crowd.
"This place is located near St Andrew's College, Bandra and I have been visiting this place since many years now.This place serves a wide variety of small bites . The roast lamb sandwich that they serve is to die for. I also love their chicken chilly croissants. The only cons are that they don't accept card payment and they have very limited seating."

A nice small place serving great snacks and coffee. Good seating area and nice ambience. A meal for two costs within RS. 500. The only disadvantage I saw is they don't accept card.
"A hidden gem in Bandra. It is a little cafe that's serves extremely tasty snack items. I've visited this place several times and everytime I go, I love it even more. I've tried many of their items like the chicken croissant, chicken samosa, mini hotdog, chocolate tart,etc. Nothing ever disappoints me. Even their burgers are extremely tasty. Plus, they are very affordable."
This is one of the hidden gems of Bandra. No wonder why the place is always full and at times you might have to wait for your turn. I have been here multi times and to be honest everything on the menu is a must try
"Cafe Andora is a small joint near Andrews college

What we ordered-
1)Chicken burger:
One of the best burgers I've eaten for the price! They are soft as well as juicy and just heavenly with their schezwan sauce.

2)Mayo roll:
Its a very samll roll which you can literally finish in a bite. The overall taste was good.

Don't go around the evening as most of the stuff is over

Also you have to pay extra for the schezwan sauce but trust me, it's worth every penny."

"Super Duper Hit😍

They've been serving yummy snacks & a few maincourse items too.

Located near St. Andrews College this place is among the most famous eateries in Bandra W.

We have eaten most of the items from here which include Chicken Chilli Roll, Chicken Mayo Roll, Chicken Crockett Roll, Chicken S/W, Lollypops, Donuts, Breadpudding etc.. the best part is they serve mini version of all their signature rolls.
Some rare items that we can get from here include Lasagne, Pie's, Bread Pudding, Danish Pastry & more.
The food is awesome & one will actually fall in love with the taste.

"Andora's has been a classic favourite for neighbouring colleges and schools for many years now, serving vegetarian and non vegetarian tid bits such as chicken patties, sandwiches , rolls and even East Indian fugiyas ( which are nothing but deep fried balls of dough) and have also earned a reputation for their shezuan sauce. A good place to pick up appetizers."
"A cute and cozy place to enjoy your date, away from all the noise pollution. The interiors gives the proper cafe feel. The staff is friendly. Good options for coffee and desserts are available"
Think the food quality has deteriorated over time. This used to be great with the best being the chilly chicken crossaint but that’s a thing of the past now.
"Got a takeaway from this place... had heard alot about it
Savouries are okish at affordable prices... the cheese croissant and the cheese inside was very hard... the spring roll was good
The vegetable sandwich, I felt, was overloaded with green chutney so it felt salty... the chicken sandwich was good
Packaging was fine... I feel it can do better
Will give it another try to try out different items"
"The chicken chilly roll and mayonnaise chicken roll are my favourite, the Quiche is also amazing. The roasted chicken is yum and also the best veg sandwich I've ever had is from here."
"For bandraites this is home.nice and cozy,place where everyone loves to hangout and yet the vibes of this place is do home like where you munch and talk and just be and know for their food it's like evergreen they have maintained the consistency of the taste of their food."
"Best bakery in Bandra
Do try all the bakery products
Best quality and reasonable price and friendly staff
Near Andrew's college

Sunday closed"
"Amazing place. Situated in a niché opposite st. Andrews high school,it promises you delicious yet budget food.
Tried their chicken roll and chicken sandwich which was yummy. My friend tried their cheese croissant which was good too.
Not many options for vegetarians though"
"This is a landmark snacks shop in bandra west off hill road and the go to place for st Andrew's College and school students. It has been there since ages and direct competition with hearsh bakery just 10 minutes down the road. Classic snacks are hot dog (kheema) chicken roll, chicken croquettes, chicken mini croissant (but sometimes this has only stuffing and no meat or hardly any meat inside) personally I prefer the choice frm hearsh bakery. The chicken biryani is slightly sweetish (catholic style)"
"I quite enjoyed the unique bites offered up at this warm - college student friendly cafe where Sausage Rolls, Chicken Croquettes, Chicken LollyPops & other popular snacks are served. The service was prompt & the crowd looked like they were looking for a fuss free snack. I was impressed with how chunky & juicy their chicken lollypops were & also enjoyed their croquettes (which aren’t commonly available in Mumbai). I can imagine that getting small bites for an intimate gathering from Andoras because of just how yummy everything looks. Look no further if you’re keen to grab a bite on the go or sit for a few minutes & get those carb cravings satiated."
Tasty and affordable bites. Chilled-out vibe. Lots of variety. A truly simple and nostalgic place. We particularly enjoyed their date and walnut cake this time around.

"Have been a regular to andoras for years now. All my school snacks were sourced from her. Great place, love the spring rolls and the pepper chicken croissant, but i hear they discontinued it now."
This place is situated at hill road next lane to St Andrews this place serves nice croissant and breads my favourite is chicken roti and Punjabi samosa Very yummy it's a small caffe in Bandra but quiet famous one
"A pleasant café that serves amazing Chicken mayonnaise hot dogs, mouth watering barbeque chicken and much more that you can try. It is extremely reasonable, the staff members are really kind and sweet ,they can try to serve a bit more faster, but its worth the wait."
It's the best place in bandra for a light snacks. They do Chinese food it's awesome Excellent home made authentic... very hygiene... will surely tickle your taste buds... highly recommended... reasonably priced.. must try for all!
"Excellent place for school and college kids.
Just opp st Andrew's college and school this place can never be missed.
Tiny place with outdoor sitting but amazing food is a place to visit.
Their chicken roll and barbeque chicken is worth trying.
WARNING:As it is a cheap and good food joint its over crowded.
But still worth the wait😊"
"Been here 25 years back during my college days and till date is been consistent with the quality of food they have .

Always feel good to be here, lot of memories attached to this joint .Decent sitting outside to hang out with friends and family. Definately recommend this place if your looking out for good food without pinching your pocket Much."
"Don't think this place needs any introduction.
Popular among most people in Mumbai foodies, especially people from Bandra.
Have had most of their dishes which are so reasonably priced and have liked almost all of them: -)
Should definitely try this place.

Dishes that should be tried: chicken samosas, chicken chilli rolls, chicken lollipop

Food 4/5
VFM 5/5
Service 4/5"
"It's a cute little and very crowded cafe opposite to St. Andrew's school. Everything is so dirt cheap that you won't believe your eyes. We had chicken samosa chicken mayo roll, chicken sausage roll, chicken chilli croissant, chicken puff and potato chicken chop, chicken lollipop and coffee. I liked the puffs better than the rolls. You can go there if you're around linking road and craving for some light-on-the-pocket snacks."
"A typical, typical Catholic cafe which offers a great deal of mouth watering delicious at dirk cheap prices. The cafe is placed right opposite Andrews which is kinda the end of Hillroad. So after a tiring shopping haul out there this place is the best to end your day with. Ordered a lasagna that was served in good quantity and tasted great. Then we ordered Chicken samosa, Minced Chicken pie, cheese croissant and a mini hotdog, everything was amazing and the bill came out to be quite reasonable too!

The place brings to you the atmosphere that you’d probably experience in one of Goa’s cafes. So if you’re in Bandra and like hanging around the retro cafes do pay a visit here!"
"Cafe Andoras his located next to my school in bandra and I have been eating from here for the last 25 years. The best part about bandras is that they offer real maglorean-goan savory food. My favourites here are the Potato chops and the chicken sausage rolls, mini hotdog rolls and pan rolls. but you must also try the spring rolls they are out of the world."
"Been a regular at Andoras ever since I was in college and they always have been awesome.
Their savouries are always good and tasty.
Must tries are the Chilly Chicken Croissant, Burgers, Hot Dogs and rolls.
Their grilled chicken is also yummy and perfect if your looking for something healthy.
Overall they have managed to maintain their taste over the years and go super easy on the price.
Excellent job Andoras."
"Cafe Andora had this amazing chicken hot dog.The first time I tasted it fell in love with it.The flavours are mouthwatering.It's a self service but the people working there are kind.The rate are reasonable and pocket friendly.The atmosphere around the sitting area is so chilled and freshening and feels close to nature.The cafe proof the saying right that ""old is gold""."
"A must visit for students as it is really affordable with good quality food. This place is almost always overcrowded with the students St. Andrew's college bandra. The staff service is good. It is a self service place and provides seating area too.The food here is finger licking delicious and craved by students as well as the residents of hill road.
Must haves are chicken croissants, chicken burger and chicken fried rice."
The vibes of being in South Goa hit me hard whenever i hit this place! Favourite food place also an amazing place to hangout with friends and family! Food is reasonably priced! Also the music and the ambience make this place scintillating!
"A small bakery situated bang opposite St. Andrew's college. This place serves budget yummy confectionery and you'll always find this place buzzing with all types of crowd who come here for a light meal.

Cafe Andora is known for its chicken items as well as cakes, muffins and brownies. You can also try their meals where they serve Chinese food.

One of the best place to come during break time of St Andrews college. The meals over your are quite affordable and the quality of food served is apparently one of the best in Bandra
"We visited this place for breakfast today. We ordered the chicken burger, chicken puff, chicken Samosa, chicken roll and veg pie. Everything was really good. The advantage this place has over A1 and Hercshe is that they have a proper place to sit and eat. It's a nice pocket friendly place mainly for college students."
Just been here few hours ago...this place disappointed me badly; especially after going here since decades; the staff is extremely rude especially the short man with salt and pepper hair..if this is the hospitality industry then customer service is of utmost importance...there is an ocean of cafes/bistros in Bandra...so you'll please teach your staff some manners first...an absolute terrible experience...👎👎👎😡😠😡😠
Fantastic place to brunch on some chicken rolls and decent lunch.... Located bang Opp St Andrews.... Totally in love with the food.... Hiwever it will be great if these guys could start delivery from zomato ..
