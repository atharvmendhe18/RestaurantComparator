Review
The biryani was not authentic dum Biryani. It was a thick gravy based rice dish and too spicy to be eaten. The starter chicken tikka was quite good. A very small place with limited seating area.
"I have order...
Nawabi biryani and cheese garlic both are soo much tasty and yummy and delicious..
Quantity and quality of food are also good...
Packing was nice..
Delivery was on time....
Order form this place and enjoy the amazing food"
"Must visit if you're a Biryani Lover ..Comfortable and cozy place specially if you are a Foodie. Also the Kabab were Amazing..

Staff quite helpful and Nice Decor

"This is a place in navi Mumbai where u can actually enjoy biryani. In the name of biryani one can eat different kinds of pulav in resturants but this joint actually has improved the bar with their preparation.
They have different servings based on no of people's. Best part is the biryani are cooked in earthen pots with sweet dough covering. The cover taste awesome with their garlic mayo. Their mayo has a distinctive taste which is for sure can tingle ur taste buds.
For desserts u can have caramel custered to complete ur eating experience.

"I wanted to visit this outlet since 2018 but My experience at Birista Biryani outlet is really horrible...

‚è∫Ô∏è Murgh Burrah Kebab : 8 small pieces of kebab giving only black pepper like taste and it was not at all worth for Rs. 320/-

‚è∫Ô∏è Murgh Nawabi Biryani : we had ordered Double size...As per recommendation given by waiter it is the spiciest Biryani they offer....

"Murgh Nawabi Biryani - The biryani was cooked on dum and served in an earthen pot which was sealed with a dough for proper mix of the spices. It was one of the most amazing biryani's I had which was full of spices and very flavourful. Also, the basmati rice was fairly cooked, chicken was juicy and tender with the right amount of masala. One pot serves two. 5 stars for this biryani.
Starters:
Murgh Sia Seekh - The grilled seekh was soft and succulent which had flavours of mint and coriander which served 4 pieces.
Surkh Murgh Tikka - The chicken was tender and spicy which served 4-6 pieces.
Murgh Burra - The chicken is cooked full in red spices which is topped with cream and when combined...read more"
"Although the spices in Nawabi Biryani tasted good, the chicken in Nawabi Biryani was not good. It was either stale/undercooked. Earlier had ordered Butter chicken which tasted amazing. Had good hopes for Chicken Biryani."
"Tried out the Chicken Seekh Biryani and opted for meal for 2. Absolutely loved the portion, the flavours. It was so flavourful and spicy that I had tears in my eyes (not a bad thing). Ended the meal with caramel custard, which was simple and nice. Hope they open an outlet in the suburban."
When it comes to desserts all you wanna have is a beautiful caramel custard. And birista in belapur serves you some authentic biryani and kebabs along with these delicious custards. Highly recommend place if you are somewhere near belapur.
"Ordered a birista biryani for two
Quantity was not sufficient for two
Had only bones with somewhat meat
Not a good experience.üôÅ"
"Visited with very high hopes for the biryani but i didn't find it an extraordinary. The portions were on the lower side but the kebabs tasted amazing. üòã
5/5 for the caramel custard tho üòãüòã
Maybe i should give place another go with the Biryani but as of now, I'm not at all satisfied with what i had. üòÖ"
2 very very small chicken pieces. More than 70% of rice was only masala. Very bad for rs 330. Absolute waste of money.

"This place can blow your mind with their super yummy Mughlai delicacies. A laconic way to say it's a must visit place for Non-veg lovers and Veg peeps can give a try. Taste, Quality, Service everything was just perfect."
"We decided to have lunch at Birista, there was a lot of hype about the Pot Biryani from Birista, so we thought of trying it
To my suprise the place didn't look very hygienic
The table wasn't cleaned properly and the plates given were also dusty.
The staff was cooperative but I felt they should have more idea regarding the menu.
Coming to the food
‚Ä¢Surkh Murg Tikka- It was tender and spicy, could have been roasted more but it was fine .

One of the Best Chicken Biryani's ever had. Superb Space & Ambience. The best part of all is Delicious Food & Ultimate Execution & Cleanliness. Keep up the Standard & Growth is all yours team BIRISTA :)
"A small cozy outlet with good ambience and courteous staff. We had ordered, Chicken Tangdi Kebab and mutton Birista Biryani. Both tasted so damn yummmmyyyyyyy üòã. But Biryani was super duper amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è. A must try guys. We wanted to try mutton chaanp but unfortunately they didn't have it at that time. I am definitely going to visit them again to try their mutton chaanp."
"The order was taken incorrectly..asked for non veg , and delivered veg.right order was delivered by 3 on for lunch.plus food wasn't up to the mark.first and last order on Zomato"
"Birista does full justice to it's name and serves scrumptious kebabs and biryanis

Anything and everything tasted there has been beautifully cooked and spiced to perfection.

Might be tough to get a place to sit as it has very few tables."
"LOCATION - located in CBD belapur sector - 15
AMBIENCE - the place is small yet so well maintained, neat and clean. Sitting arrangements are good not too congested. The dinning tables are wooden as well as chairs. The center of attraction here is the food pictures are framed on the wall. They clay pots are arranged on the wall so beautifully and it's eye catching. The one thing is lacking is hand washing facility the most basic and important thing is lacking.
I have visited the place with my husband.
MAIN COURSE - as the place is very famous for biryani we decided to order one murg nawabi biryani (one bone) served for 2. The quantitie was sufficient for 2.

"This is one of the best place to have biryani. The murg tikka biryani is absolutely amazing. It is a must try for everyone. For the vegetarian ones, the aatshi aalo is great. Have it with paratha."
I was wondering about the taste of Biryani from Birista. So I ordered Veg Birista Biryani which turned out to be perfect. It was served hot and in a traditional clay pot. It was a good packing and presentation. Taste wise it was awesome. Fresh veggies cooked in a gravy and fragrant Basmati rice. Totally worth it.
"A small place, good food, family vibes.
We ordered 2 biryanis and both were really tasty and frankly too much for our stomach. The staff was courteous. Overall good experience."
"Visited this place an witnessed some delicious Pot Biryani and tasty and tender kebabs!!
.
What we tried?
Murgh Nawabi Pot Biryani:
Extremely yummy and fingerlickingly delicious!
Aromatic rice, cooked with ginger jullien, chillies, goghurt, garam masala cooked in earthern pot.
.
Aatishi aaloo: all potato lovers pay attention. Your favourite aaloo is getting a makeover!!
Soft and creamy made from selected potatoes cooked in yellow and red masala, mustard, and stuffed with panner.

Do visit this place to try all your self!!

"Simply amazing, really a gem of a place. Neat, clean and delicious food. Felt like having biryani for dinner, Zomato came to the rescue as usual. Was a bit skeptical given the size of the place, having crossed it umpteen number of times going to other outlets. Anyways, went in ordered the least spicy chicken dum biryani with bone on the recommendation of the server. What caught my eye was the neatness of the place and the way in which the various tikkas, kebabs etc are displayed. Mouthwatering to say the least. Had to wait a bit as expected. Biryani was delicious, the server also serves the dough cover on top of the handi along with the biryani. It goes beautifully with the chicken....read more"

This place was highly recommended by some friends, and I had very high hopes when I finally managed a visit.

We ordered the kakori kababs and the Deccan murg kababs for starters. The Deccan murg was quite succulent and flavorsome. I guess the kakori wasn‚Äôt bad either, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs never been my favourite kabab.

Alas, I was quite disappointed with their biryanis. While the presentation was great, being served in a sealed clay handi, the same can‚Äôt be said for the taste. I could not get any flavour except kewra, which is not something I care for much in biryani or anything else. The mutton and...read more"
"Belapur is one emerging place on food scene and Birista is a surprise find. Its predominantly a biryani place.

Murgi Birista biryani is what I had, the dough coating is to be eaten with mayo(loved it), coming to the biryani, it was good, q bit different but good.

While you there, you must try their murg burrah with paratha, it's awesome.

Tried their caramel custard and rabdi, while the custard is good, their rabdi was awesome."
"Have visited this place a lot of times
They make great biryani and great starters !!
Always enjoy my visit here.
Murgh burrah and Tikka biryani must try!!!!"
Here u can enjoy the best DUM biryani flavour and spices and the dessert over here is the best part. I have tried chicken boneless biryani which was super good and MUST TRY BREAD RABDI.
I ORDERED A MURG BIRISTA BIRYANI. IT CAME IN A POT LIKE VESSEL AND IT TASTED AWESOME. DO TRY THAT IF U LOOKING FOR A GOOD BIRYANI. THOUGH THE QUANTITY WAS FINE.
"This place has some mouth watering kebabs - MUST TRY all of them!

This place is actually famous for its biryani which I actually just found very average but the kebabs were soft, tender, perfectly cooked, well spiced. ü§§

Love the little chutney box and freshly cut onions to add to the flavour."
"Birista - Biryanis & Kebabs - Kharghar

Sunday we order Murgh Tikka Biryani for 3 to 4 people. We shock when we taste that biryani. Taste was very bad, rice quality was not good & smiling horrible, chicken quantity handily 4 to 5e pieces. Biryani quantity not sufficient for 4 person. This kharghar outlet was not up to the mark. Please try CBD Belapur outlet for Taste Biryani"
"Ordered via zomato Afgan paneer biryani for lunch.
You get biryani delivered in this lovely pots covered with roti, mayo n raita as sides just wow!!
The aafgan paneer biryani was lovely... the flavour and spices were perfect ... paneer was juicy n tasty ... rice cooked well. It was 5/5 üòã
Quantity is less wen you compare to prices.
No matter taste is best!!!"
"I ordered Firni from Birista and it was tasty. I wouldn‚Äôt say the best but it was good, if the rice granules would have been a little softer then it would have been just perfect üëåüèª. The sweetness was perfect Neither way too sweet nor very little . Overall it was good."
Pathetic chicken tikka briyani over spiced chicken was hard and over cooked. And the Rabdi (dessert the last and the best part of the meal ) was disappointing in all the sense the taste and it gave a flavour of the mud of the pot it was served it . Totally disappointed with the food please improve the standard and deliver good food instead of spending on packaging check the inside product and work on it people are spending for the food also not only the packaging.
Great place for biryani and kebab lovers. Staff is also friendly. Worth the money. Loved the food. Veg biryani is also amazing. Verity of veg Starters can be improved.
Excellent biriyani. Tried Afgan paneer biriyani and boneless chicken biriyani. Very well balanced flavour. Not overly spicy or greasy. I loved their portion concept where in u can order the same dish as per the number of eating members. The ambiance is relaxed and very open and the waiting staff is great. The menu is slightly limited and my suggestion is to include some drinks.
"So we visited Birista, since we wanted to try the famous Pot Biryani. We had this Afgani Tikka Biryani and Murgh Sia Seekh.
.
.
The Kebabs were so goooood. They were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. The chutney that was served with the kebabs was a mix of mayonnaise and green chutney and they served it with onions.

Kebabs - 9/10

Coming to the Biryani, so because we had the kebabs which were a bit spicy, we ordered the Afgani Tikka Biryani which was not spicy although it was a bit sweet, not too sweet but had a good taste.

"visited here for sunday brunch. had ordered butter chicken, taste was good, less spicy; murgh birista biryani whose presentation was good with each rice grain to be seen perfect, chicken was perfectly cooked and the zafrani phirni and shahi rabdi, both tasted good. fully recommended for 0ot biryanis and shahi rabdi."
This place is an example that we can expect a lot at a reasonable price. Biryani is marvelous. Chicken is nice and juicy. Deccan chicken has foodgasmic flavor
Good food I often visit and order online only the problem is if you order only one pot biriyani for under the category of 2 or more as they give option still birista gave one raita and one mayo which is very very less . If I am Ordering for two or more then I should get Raita and mayo in same ratio. Just this part is sad rest is good
"Undoubtedly Awesome Food, one must try the Taste of Birista. It should have branches in South Mumbai & North Mumbai. Delicious Deserts as well."
"Starters are lip smacking. Biryanis are not that great.
Service is little bit slow. Ambience is hard to fit in.
Not heavy on pocket. Menu is limited for Main course.But starters are worth try."
Birista has amazing non veg starters; my fav is always Murug Anghara. I have never visited the place in person and mine was always ‚Äúhome delivery ‚Äú. The delivery is prompt and they have amazing North Indian food . The chicken Biriyani served in a pot is not only yummy but also has a large portion.
"Had chicken afghani and chicken biryani on a lazy Sunday. Starters was well cooked , soft and juicy. The biryani was made very spicy which made it difficult to eat"
"Of all the biryani outlets that I've tried at CBD Belapur, there are hardly good biryani outlets here and Birista biryani is one of them.

Great Indian mughlai food. This place is very well known for its kebabs.. something that I've tried and would like to recommend -üî∑Cheesy paneer corn seekh- sinful and absolutely yummy veg variant of seekh...must try!

üî∂Mutton kakori seekh- Mouthwatering minced mutton seekh which melts in your mouth.. worth it.

"Birista is one of the restaurant which serves fresh and delicious biryanis as well as kebabs. The area is small but it is worth visiting. Rates here are reasonable and for three of us, we had to order 2 starters and 2 double biryanis.

STARTERS :
1. Murgh Burrah (the one with white sauce) - This dish had 6 pieces of nice tender chicken with tasty creamy sauce.
2. Deccan chicken - This dish too had 6 pieces and the chicken was bit spicy and the green chutney goes perfect with the Deccan chicken.

"I read good reviews about this restaurant and decided to give it a try.

We ordered Dum Biryani and one Kebab. The Biryani was way way too spicy, so much that we did not enjoy the food at all. The kebabs were also pretty average. The restaurant had nice ambience and clean looks. We asked the waiter to give us some plain biryani rice as the biryani was full of Green Chilly and he gave us a few grains in a very small plate that did not make any difference."
Over hyped place for biryani. Waited for long time in queue before getting the table. The biryani that we ordered wasn't that good. Amount of chicken added was less.
This place is absolutely worth a try... Their biryani is perfectly cooked... though the place is little tiny..so u cannot sit for a long time once ur done with eating... But...its absolutely fine... Better thn biryaniguru

I ordered Murg tikka Biryani. The quality and quantity of the food is awesome. I love the packing. It was a nice experience. Must try Biriyani
"The most delicious biryani in Mumbai. Tried a variety of kebabs, Murg Pasanda was by far the best. The rest are quite average. They only serve parathas with the kebabs which is crunchy and super tasty. The portions are great too. Staff is cheerful and friendly."
Perfect place for non-veg lovers ......menu is very small and simple....they have different type of kababs and Biriyani.. desert is also very unique. ... quantity is little less but quality is good.... service is also good... I like to come again....

"I had ordered veg biryani. It gave me the feeling of authenticity. The rice was soft, sweet and moist. Every spice in the gravy expressed its flavour. It was overall a lovely experience. I would definitely recommend it."
Worst biryani I have ever tasted . Very very spicy . Mouth was burning even after rinsing . Very oily and no balance in quantity of rice and gravy
Kalmi Tangdi was really tasty but the biryani that we ordered Nawabi biryani wasn't that good. It was very average and the quantity was really not sufficient enough. Quite disappointing tbh.
"My cousin and I planned for dinner and we opted some options and finally we decided to eat Biryani and that too to try out at a new place so we went for Birista Belapur.

Their menu doesn't have much of varieties yet but what they have is grt and best.

"I am a regular customer at birista and the experience has been exceptional. However today when i visited the outlet they possibly served us stale chicken and the after taste was horrible. The place has been a regular visit spot but today has been extremely disappointing. Also surprisingly the place had a foul smell today. Despite informing it to them, the staff said they had no air freshner and did nothing about it."
Amazing biryanis. You can understand when the food is made with love. That presentation for a home delivery is rare. It comes from a restaurant that really cares about their customers. Definitely recommend this place !
This is a small outlet which serves amazing biryani. I had their signature birist mutton biryani and it was delicious. I really liked that we could eat the dough covering the dum biryani pot. They serve a garlic flavoured mayo which goes really well with the dough covering the pot which in itself has sweetish taste.
one of the worst biryanis ever had. expected good result. especially after hearing so much about it.
The biryani was packed in a small matki and was presented nicely but the chicken tikka was under cooked and i could feel the taste of raw spices
"Cravings for biryani..birista is the place..üòã
