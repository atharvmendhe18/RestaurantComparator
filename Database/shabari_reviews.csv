Review
"The delivery person was very rude
He didn't have a change in notes for money
trying to fleece
my bill was 411 ,no change he had
i have 511 ,he did not have 100 Rs change"
I have specifically asked for gravy manchurian. Sent me dry Manchurian. Have also asked in cooking instructions to add more gravy.. they even accepted it. They should have atleast informed

worst service you will have to adjust with other customers if you go single or duo pair there is no tables for duos and thus you will have to share the quad table with other people
One item was missing - Crispy veg

I ordered without onion garlic but I received with onion garlic
The crispy Veg consists of only coating n almost no vegetables.
Did not get Mazza which was ordered. The restaurant forgot or the delivery guy did not send.
