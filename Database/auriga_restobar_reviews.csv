Review
Went to this place for the evening with friends.. Do not recommend anyone go to this place as the staff was very lousy and service was extremly slow.. the food was horrible and overpriced..
"Horrible food and service. I don't recommend this place to anyone . Go at your own risk, and it's overpriced for the level they provide. Not worth it at all"
"This place had Lousy food, terrible service, bad mannered staff, unbearable music and serously terrible drinks.
Definiteky a place to avoid !"
"Third class place with no courtesy for patrons. Bad food. Reluctant service. No value for money. Regret visiting this place. Pathetic music , ill mannered staff , lousy drinks, place kept dirty. Will never visit this place again."
"Found the food very mediocre. If anything was worse than the food, it was the service. Do not recommend this place. Won‚Äôt be back anytime soon."
A great place to spend your night. Firstly it was named Tonic. Right from the music to drink to food everything is perfect. Bar looks fabulous. There mocktails are clear winner. Service staff was polite. This place goes mad after 11. Recommended this place for food ambience and D. J.
Me and my wife decided to have a nice evening and planned one at auriga. To begin with everything was wrong about this place. Our reservations were not noted and had to wait for a table. The food ordered was unhygienic and my wife found a dead insect in her dish. On complaining..the staff was reluctant to help and put the blame on us. The management was peculiarly uncourteous and uncouth. The food and floor service is below industry standards and not up to the mark. My advice for anyone planning a visit to auriga/tonic is to give this one a SKIP!
I would like to rate (-)minus not even 1...terrible food n pathetic service..would not recommend anyone to go...i n my friend just happen to go to this place but didn't know would be such a bad night n experience..not worth it at all...
Does not deserve even 1 out of 10. Maintenance is bad. Mannerless staff... Food is sub standards..what do they charge for.. I once apparently went along with a food critic... And we were shocked to know about their ways of cooking and kitchen hygiene ethics. Hidden stuff.. you can't cheat and try to put up a good place. It deserves to shut down... The way it's functioning
"Miserable food and service. Never been to a worse restaurant. Wonder how they have managed to survive for so long. All previous good reviews must have been self-written.
Roadside food would have been better."
"Terrible food and service, definitely would never go there again. Authorities should take action against such poor establishments. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to any one ."
"Pathetic service - The staff just don't care - They need training badly - After getting their attention they are so slow
Lousy food - also need a better choice of options
Unclean place / Loo
Highly avoidable"
"Obnoxious behaviour, atrocious service, stale and unhigenic food, the management and staff was extremely rude with ladies. Avoid, avoid at all cost!!!"
"Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Food options so limited, there's no point having a freaking menu. Staff a little slow. Hopefully the food tastes good. Recommend you to avoid coming to this place. Completely ruined our mood."
"Last night we organised a pillow party for around 100 people ! And when taken the review from all ,
Each one of them had the best fun !
The ambience , the DJ , the music , the food ,
And the pillow fight fun they had was just just amazing !
Thank you Rakesh sir & Santosh Sir for everything
Looking forward to organise more events"
The worst bar. Don't go anytime. orders never come on time.. please avoid it................................................ ................
"I like to experience new places, so one of my friend suggested this place which was firstly named as TONIC.

Food was good, but the service was poor on which they need to take in consideration.

Ambience was great and inspiring, no parking available. Other part of Auriga is in construction."
Been with frnds it's a Happening place in good budget.food and drink with lovely music loved this place .wil recommend others also....wil visit again üëç
"A great place to spend your night along with dinner. Music is amazing, Food is delicious. Ambience is so lovely, Makes you fall in love with the place."
My first recommendation is just go!!!! Right from the music to food to drinks everything is so brilliant!! Well most catchy part was amazing music..I am still not over it! The best place to have great night life .
Been here for one of our corporate parties. The ambience of this place is pretty amazing. They have a separate floor where the parties can take place. Music is great. The bar looks fabulous. The food is decent. Worth checking it out.
good ambiance and the taste of the food is good .
"CUISINE:  Asian

FOOD AND DRINKS: The menu is extensive and while it is hard enough to choose what to eat, it is harder to pick a mocktail; there are some creative blends ‚Äì pineapple-coriander, banana-wasabi. In the starters, we tried the shiitake mushrooms (spicy but too strong in garlic), the chef‚Äôs hat (seaweed rolls which take some getting used to) and the crispy pomfret (we recommend this). In the main course, we recommend the Vietnamese rice with lamb for its spices and great balance of meat and egg. We tried the vegetarian chargrilled flat noodles but found them too bland. The desserts were disappointing. While well presented, they just didn‚Äôt taste right.

"If u want to hop on d floor with great Music & some finger food. Thats an amazing place to be in d heart of the city. Asian food is good to try after u finish dancing :-)
Mocktails are nicely crafted with the menu. The Service n security are very co operative."

"It's not a place to trust...I had inquired about this place to host a party to which they attended well but later we realised that they cheated on us fr lot of things and when questioned about it they had no answer but manipulated the whole thing.
Manager of the place has not been very generous and inspite of our repeated follow-up they have not shown up.@
I would never recommend this place to anyone as they lack basic proffesionalism and ethics...they can't be trusted upon."
"This spacious resto-bar has exquisite interiors and some best food to offer. he food is lovely, and what was nice is that our server informed us that almost all options could e in veg., we ordered Mongolian Baby corn with five spice was fantastic to start with while the Balinese vegetable curry with white rice made for an excellent and filling main course. service is too good.."
"You will get disappointed with the amount of crowd this place pulls even on a Friday. The lounge downstairs is mostly empty unless there is a private event invited confirmed set of guests. So not the ideal venue for a fun night out. 

The restaurant upstairs is the only saving grace for this place thanks to the chefs cooking up reasonably delectable dishes. We offer these points mainly for the delicious Khao Suey that we savoured during our visit. It is not very often that we get to enjoy these rare dishes in the city especially considering the handful of restaurants that actually have it in their menu. However, again if you are the only ones sitting in a restaurant, it doesn't exactly...read more"
"This place has a very pretty and well structured decor.. I liked the ambience of this place. The service was good too. The drinks were super cheap during happy hours. Good crowd. However, I'd prefer to go to tonic instead. Auriga is done up just a stylishly as Tonic, awaiting some chic paintings for the walls that have been kept bare for now. A huge place with all options of seating ‚Äì sofas, high chairs...and now food test is awessome We were in for Burnt Garlic Cottage Cheese Burger ‚Äì you will love it for being just the right taste and just the right size! The cottage cheese feels refreshing with the veggies, and in case you are a meat-eater, you wouldn‚Äôt miss meat at all; Grilled...read more"
"This place is just above tonic.The place is small but the music out here is updated and really good.They have a screen too where they play the song and the video. We ordered risotto, paneer chilly,magherita and red sauce pasta.Magherita was bland.In drinks we ordered black and white scotch,miller and LIT.Black and white with red bull is advisable. (Not good with the soda).This place goes mad after 11 . Definitely worth a try."
Food was great. Tried quite a lot of things but would go again for the spiced bambooshoot dumpling.and the veggie tortellini with burnt butter sauce. Booze is a bit pricey but worth it. Special mention to the DJ.. great music!
"Check zomato, the interior pictures are really fascinating. However when you visit this place, its even better.
I had been here once for dinner and had a great experience.
Food was better than what expected but priced a bit high.
They have good options in happy hours though liqour prices are a little high.
Service is is quick and the staff is good.
The highlight of this place is its interiors which makes the ambience really good.
Had a great time, worth a visit.
I would recommend this place for its beautiful interiors.
Cheers!"
I am in love with this place...I have had the most amazing time here and the staff is also very helpful. The amazing interior adds to experience. The food is also delicious and I have been recommending this place to all my friends for dinner plans ever since my first visit.
Amazing ambience.. Quite cool place. A good happening restobar to be at with your buddies and GF... Know for its food too.. Not a cool place for non drinkers.
"After partying at tonic we headed upstairs for dinner and this was around 11:30ish so it was pretty late and the kitchen was about to close in an hours time. We were a vegetarian party so we ordered Schezwan Fried Rice,Thai Rice and a Chinese Manchurian kinda gravy which were all good to taste. The portions of the rice items were a little limited I felt. The gravy was a disappointment as it was more like a Manchow soup as it was devoid of any sort of dumplings. Otherwise the rice items had the usual taste you'll experience at any Chinese restaurant; nothing extravagant.
I had ordered their specialty dish of Mac n Cheese which was scalding hot but I enjoyed it very much. The portion was...read more"
"I was in Phoenix Mills window shopping when suddenly my friend had a craving for Chinese food. I searched cuisine specific, and, wallah, Auriga showed up. Not too far from there, and apparently open till 1am! The friendly guy on the phone said they will be taking orders till midnight, no problemo. I was very casually dressed in a tee n shorts (Hey, this detail is important!).
It was 11pm on a Sunday night and I expected the place to be half empty and it was.
The ground floor is a pub called Tonic belting out hip music. The upper area seemed like a sitting space.
We were about to enter when the guy at the entry told me that there is a ""dress code"". N i was clearly underdressed. I...read more"
"Invited for a friend's party. The upper level is pretty spacious for a resto bar and there is ample place to dance if the alcohol demands so. The food served was good enough to suit the palate, but not delicious. The service was a highlight though. Prompt and courteous."
"Awesomest food, especially the korean sesame chicken & thai spicy chicken. Service was great by a mr. Fernandes. Good music & good staff overall."
D ambience is one of its kind...music is just rockin...food n drinks is yummy...d only drawback is dat d place gets shut a bit early...needs to xtend it by half an hr...45 mins..dats d suggestion il like to give...cheers
"Deirus the manager is the man we just dropped in at the place and he gave us the table though the place was reserved
The food is good above expectations  the music is nice makes u remember ur college days"
"If you want to drink...this the place....if you want music...this is the place...if you want to dance this is the place...if you good starters...this is the place..if you want great crowd... this the place
Highly recommended.. Just go nd hv a blast.."
"Superb place, vibrant atmosphere, classy food... The mngt is also good.. Hosted a party for arnd 50 people n it ws awesome.. Advtnge, no parking issues... Only disadvtnge, no Indian food for desi eaters..."
"Let's just go for the ambience first - AMAZING, sitting under a funky roof which looked like stacked bamboos and fancy lightings, with the bar on one side and a big screen on the other end. There was some kinda private party going on a Friday night, came out to be some college kids which anyways we didn't mind because the song selection was good.
The bartender was good and the drinks were super cheap, well they have happy hours till 1 am, which was pretty unexpected. The sides we ordered were good and the portions were filling enough. Pan asian cuisine looked good on the menu, didn't try anything though cause we were in a mood to just get drunk.
In short visit this place for the cheap...read more"
"Mixed reviews! well, finally paid a visit! 
This place has a very pretty and well structured decor.. Was made up by an architect who wanted to theme this place & he did a damn good job, must admit! 
Food - Well, it tasted good, so unsure if we went on the right day, or did the others land up there at the wrong time :) Loved their food to be honest! 
Well, we had quiet a good time given we landed up here on a Bollywood night! 
Crowd - mood spoilers! Due to which We did not hang out here for more than 45 mins so this is all I summed up !
However, the music and food is something we would go back for :)"
"Had the best pan asian cuisine here. Service provided is amazing. Of all, the ambience is too beautiful which makes one stay there for longer"
"Went to auriga on a sunday night. Place is well made. Got a table immediately since it wasnt packed. Liked the ambiance as well. Unfortunately that isnt the only thing one goes to a restaurant for.
Coming to food, it seemed like that was the worst night to have gone out for it.
We ordered the crispy paneer spring which was sweet (mentioned nowhere on the description is the menu). Next we ordered for their vietnamese spring roll which is one of their signature dishes. One couldnt have had anything more spicy than that. We couldnt even finish the portion and yet suffered from upset stomachs the next day. A strict no no for people who think of ordering it.
We ended with the malaysian flat...read more"
"We had an office party here for 24 ppl on a Friday evening. Auriga is at the top while the ground is Tonic bar.
Very few veg options so we tried the much hyped mini burgers,not something available everywhere and were pretty good. Pizza was cold and cheese not melted, corn and mushroom risotto had too much cheese and 1 serving can be easily shared by 2. Chilly French fries a and nachos were above average but not something you'll miss.
Desserts had only caramel custard, cheesecake,gooey chocolate all pretty good and the only saving grace.
Drinks had an old menu and a new menu (higher priced) which we only figured out after getting the bill; obviously we weren't paying the higher rates since...read more"
"From the Captain's Log : Through the Stargate
=========================================================

After my early evening grub and grog in Tonic, I moved up to Auriga. The old Auriga re-branded itself as Tonic which sits in the bottom and Auriga which floats on the top. The usage ""floats on the top"" works well if one thinks of Auriga as the star constellation of the same name. I walked up the stairs and it was like moving through a stargate. Leaving the neon lit and loud club atmosphere behind; and entering the relatively quieter and darker Auriga.

Ambiance

In terms of appearance, Auriga borrows some elements from Tonic like the caged lights but it still retains...read more"
"i have heard of mixed reviews about auriga before its new avatar however when i had eaten before the new makeover or now after it i have had a good experience.To start of with the place is not overtly crowded and the table spacing is very good.

 Now coming to the food , had the burnt garlic cottage cheese burger first up. Good but not great, honestly this is the best you can do with cottage cheese inside the burger as this ingredient dosent lend itself to a burger.Even when you coat it with all the coverings as MCdonalds does it still gives you the raw taste.It can either be eaten dunked in a gravy or soked in a tandoor .These guys did a decent job but i would not put paneer inside a...read more"
"We went to Auriga from Tonic, after feasting on a whole spread of snacks and quenching our souls with some extremely good cocktails. And that is what Auriga is for. A filling main course, after you have had your fill of music, snacks and drinks at Tonic. But hey! Auriga too has its share of music, drinks and great food. And another big screen TV too. So you don‚Äôt miss the match you were watching downstairs!!

Auriga is done up just a stylishly as Tonic, awaiting some chic paintings for the walls that have been kept bare for now. A huge place with all options of seating ‚Äì sofas, high chairs, regular tables ‚Äì and good lighting‚Ä¶.gives you a complete feel of a chilled out...read more"
Wen it comes to ambiance its damn cool......ya food is good according to prices quantity is less....basically taste of d food has oriental spice......loved it :)
"Highly over rated. Saw the reviews and went there. Big mistake. Firstly the beautiful view you want to enjoy is marred by d fact that the upper part of the lounge is closed for renovations. Secondly Auriga has the ambience, food , music and the booze but lacks in the most important thing, people. Literally none of them. When we in on a Sunday night I expected crowd and waiting. But expect a group of four guys the whole place was empty. Inspite of the lack of people, the waiters managed to take a long time to get our order. So if you're a loner looking for a place which makes you feel like being in a haunted place, then this is the place for you?!!! People who like the company of people...read more"
"I had been to the place once before and knew it would be perfect for my parents 25th wedding anniversary and I was proved right!
The top floor was left completely for us! Their mocktails were everyone's favourite along with the food!
Overall great experience! Must try once cause I know you will go back!"
"Great ambience, although we couldn't experience the lounge, which looks really amazing and edgy.
The food is lovely, and what was nice is that our server informed us that almost all options could be adapted to Jain versions, so this is a good place to try if you've Jain friends! Try the khao suey, turnip cake appetiser and mushroom dumplings. Also they served us Coke in Mason jars which was pretty amusing!"
"This place is worth a visit for the Auriga. The food includes Chicken, Prawns, crisp chilli Potato, barbequed mushroom bun . There is also wasabi prawns and the desserts are awesome. Infact the entire spread is very good and makes a fantastic evening."
it was a wonderful experience. Food was wonderful and service was good. Atmosphere was good overall.You must visit Auriga atleast once ! I love the service and the ambience.The drinks are good.. Overall a very good choice for especially if you have a good appetite !!!
"Although the ambiance of the restaurant and the food was good, I will rate this place low because of the horrible experience I had here. We picked this place for a colleague's farewell on Friday night. We all drank , ate and danced all night. But they served Korean sesame chicken to the vegetarians in our group in the name of Thai crispy vegetables, and when we discovered the goof up they had done.. All they did was say sorry and switch on the light for our table in the lounge. They didn't give us any waiver on our bill and they also charged us for the chicken. I was personally very disappointed. Also, there menu reads 350 INR for a red wine sangria , but they charged us 500INR for each....read more"
"Pathetic
Kindly check your bill before you leave.
Don't want to go into details but the food is pathetic .
Nothing authentic .
The papaya salad was blend to start with.
The dimsims were not at all upto the Mark.
Only positive was the babycorn in the starter sanction .
Overall bad experience.
Will never visit again not will I recommend anyone."
"A great evening

Being one who stays at an arms length from Oriental & Thai cuisines and a vegetarian, placing an order after reading the menu at Auriga was akin to shooting in the dark.
And yet there we were, with close friends, under the yellow lights and the blue zig zag contoured walls at the spacious and sparsely occupied restaurant.
I took my chances, and the result was pretty good.
The Mongolian Baby corn with five spice was fantastic to start with while the Balinese vegetable curry with white rice made for an excellent and filling main course.
The crisp chilli potato was the only disappointing dish of the evening, which for the most part was filled with friendly good natured...read more"
"Was there for a corporate party. Amazing ambiance, very nice music, great food. Best part about this place is its value for money. Can surely be tried once..."
"For me this place was reserved in my list for a special occasion and yes I must say it was worth it!Loved the ambience, loved the food. My colleague had taken our team out to this place for a treat. About food,we could not decide which one was better. All tasted good. Overall experience is great and looking forward visiting again."
"The place has good interiors , plays decent music during lunch hours , has helpful staff and food is quite good and pricing reasonable...despite that the place is running empty ! Went for Sunday brunch and we were the only 2 people to be served from 1 to 3 pm ! It really surprises me !"
"After hearing so much about this restaurant, it had always been on my bookmark list and finally I visited it.I tried spicy seafood, soba noodle, turnip cake and wasabi prawn. Everything was exceptionally delicious and well garnished. wasabi prawn gets a 5/5 which are extremely delicious too.Service is fair. Ambience is good. The prices of the dishes are appropriate for what they serve.However, I'll have to visit this place again for trying out other amusing dishes on the menu!!"
"Among the many eateries that Mumbaikars experience, this one is better than what you might usually expect a restaurant & a lounge to be. The experience will affirm it even more. Residing in Lower Parel, Auriga is place for someone who seeks the pleasures of food, cultures and cuisines that greet you in fair pricing and authentic experiences. With equally extensive food items in Veg & Non-Veg section and in separate kitchens you can definitely keep this in your frequent visit list."
"Its always a great experience when you are at Auriga Restaurant & Lounge, the spread itself is amazing. This time i tried the ginger coriander chicken, teriyaki prawn.The taste as usual was great, my friends also tried the singapur chilli crab and it was amazing as well. I saw a lot of additions on the veg side as well. Overall a great exoerience and waiting to visit again."
"Architect Sanjay Puri has designed the 2-level restaurant + lounge with a futuristically appealing d√©cor; it's a 30-seater open caf√© with silver triangular metal louvers that form an open-to¬≠-sky roof, with a beautiful blend of elegant cane furniture inside. The lounge on the ground floor can accommodate 250 people and the molecular cocktails served there, add to the ultramodern and interactive experience very well.

nice place..good food.. nice ambience.. we had gone on a weekday so it was not that crowded..but it would different on a weekend. staff is nice and sevice.is quick. loved the place.
"We went here this Sunday evening as my friend had won a free meal coupon of this restaurant in an event. I had informed my friends that the place opens at 6:30, but they called up the place THRICE n someone said it opens at 5. We reached there after a good 15mins walk from mahalaxmi station, at 5:30pm, it is situated right inside the so called Famous Studio lane. The person now informs us that the kitchen opens only after 6:30! So we were led upstairs and had no option but to wait for an hour. Although I was disappointed by this carelessness which we did bring to the notice of those people, I was very impressed with the huge space, the geometry of the structure, and the lights.

"Discovered this place on a random Friday night. The food was very good but the service was exceptional. Credit to our server Sunny.

We were at the dinner area but this place has a cool bar / lounge area which is now on my 'must visit' list."
"It's hard to locate this exquisite oriental restobar after evening. But once you do, you'll be happy you came.
I would pass on soups/salad and directly go for the Basa Fish which by the way is the most well cooked in all of South Mumbai. For a change of taste in the main course, a must try is the Balinese Chicken Curry with Jasmine rice. The Jasmine rice a fantastic blend of Japanese flavors and rice cooked to perfection.
Their customer service is excellent and ambience is wonderful."
"Have heard a lot about this place, both good and bad but I tend not to go with reviews so much as they are individually based & with such a cuisine offering, reviews become very individualistic.

So went in with a couple of friends on a Thursday evening and the place was not very crowded. I usually like semi crowded places as the service is always better & personalised.

The place is done up beautifully with it being divided into 2 sections. Music and dinner. We decided to go to the lounge section

Our order of drinks came in quick. Well presented. The music is good, ambiance is lovely. Great setup, the feeling and vibe is excellent.

They have some great cocktails which we ordered...read more"
"Visited on Saturday with my husband, the first thing we liked was the vibe of the place on entering the lounge which was crowded due to some event. We had couple of drinks in the lounge and enjoyed the music and drinks.The staff was very welcoming and warm.

The food, staff and d√©cor is really good and I recommend this place to all."
"Now, here is a place , some 5 min walk away from Mahalaxmi Station visited this place after recommended by my friends

Ambiance: Awesome Lounge at ground &  Restaurant at 1st Level which is more lively and more casual.. second for me the interiors was unbelievable.

I had ordered a particular glass of wine, which was not available but I wasn't informed of the fact until after I reminded them of the order. Food was really pathetic, we had ordered 2 small plates saut√©ed mushrooms & water chestnuts and mongolian baby-corn with five spices, both tasted exactly the same. Like it was prepared in same sauce. Large plates were equally bad, one of plate was half under cook and half over cook.

It's an awesome place people. Please don't go with the previous comments. Love the ambience .. The food is good and so r ppl .. Ashley was excellent and great abt the food being served .... Sunny and Mithun from the bar was exceptionally good ...
Don't have desserts. The cheese cake was whipped cream and Kahlua souffl√© was Hershey's chocolate syrup. The main course Pad Thai was tomato sauce and noodles. Very ok. Only positive was nice decor.
"Pathetic. We called to make a reservation - never to be informed there are two sections - lounge with music, and other a silent section for family. Randomly assigned to the family section, no effort was made by the attendants to try get us a place in the lounge. They were not even apologetic. Could not comprehend what we were requesting for."
Funky cocktails ????
Auriga! what an experience! This place is a good blend of modernity in design and traditional flavor in food. Amazing service and good options in the menu for both vegetarians and non vegetarians! This place is worth trying once!
"Now that's a bad rating but definitely have few good things for the place as well..so it was Saturday evening, like expected it was fluffed with people everywhere ..I like the bar area and the cozy sitting place around the dance floor..
Now to that place, you can't expect a smoking/outside zone where it's pouring during rains and when asked the lounge about it, very casual attitude about it.. Take it or leave it types..
You can't serve scotch in a mug, few basic things to learn
So customer service is all that this place needs to work on very drastically.."
"Tucked away in the 'Famous studio' lane is yet another Asian eatery. Patchy food and worse service but if I were to  come back to this place, it would be for the creamy green curry with all the authentic flavours singing out loud. Or for the burnt garlic Jasmine rice but it ends about there. I asked for the Japanese broth after confirming it would be a seaweed tofu soup and was served this turmeric yellow clear soup with vegetable bits - no sign of tofu or seaweed - tasty enough though just not what I was expecting.

"We had heard a lot about Auriga but when we visited the place, it was like visiting a deserted restaurant. The place has no character with the ambience and decor below average. The food was nothing to rave about, in fact I think one could get better Chinese at a smaller joint. Very very disappointing. And to top it all, the herbal tea ordered was cold!!!!!!!!"
Ambiences n decor is not everthing for a restrobar to work out.. there should b good n tasty food too.. as compare to price its a no no for anyone to visit there for meal. Went last week n food ws complete mess..all veg food ws orderd it ws my bro's birthday bt realise tht guest are not at all enjoying their dine..so finally decided to shift our dinner to some worthwhile restaurant n we all went phoenix to complete our dine.. highly disappointed. Atleast keep such food whch satisfy ur customer..
