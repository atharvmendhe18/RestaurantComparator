"I order Tandoori chicken from here often many times but have noticed recently the quantity has become less and less. The chicken is so so dry and so small pieces. Didn't seem like half tandoori, seemed like one quarter portion. Hope they improve. They are at a prime location and taste wise are good."

I have to say.. looking at the price I was worried about quantity and size of prawns. But Athithi kitchen raised my expectations and fulfilled them to another level. Kudos you guys. Tiger prawns in prawn chilli. Fresh veggies!! And OH MY GOD the taste!! ü§åüèª Just wow!! Thank you guys for feeding such amazing prawn chilli so late at night after 11 30!!
"Found cockroach in my food, very bad"
chicken is undercooked. not safe for consumption
no test
"Chicken lollipop and chicken tandoori was burnt also not fresh and stale,
the chicken lollipop was salty. I usually order from the same restaurant and food is good but this time the chicken was not at all good. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone, DONT ORDER FROM HERE"
more like a masala rice than chicken dum biryani

The test was not good please don't buy.... only sweet sweet test
Quantity was less ass compared to price
"Chicken appears to be not fresh, lots of chewing."
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SO KIND AND ADHERING TO COOKING INSTRUCTIONS! VERY GRATEFUL.
