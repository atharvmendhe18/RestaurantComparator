The bread was fried and was dripping oil. Chicken was not baked.
Perfect place for good food.. chicken crispy is good and tandoori lollypop was perfectly cooked and tasty
"liked the food but 2 things need to improve
1) please provide fried egg with chicken triple Schezwan
2) please pack the fried noodles separately, laying them at the bottom with rice packed over it makes them soggy and looses the crispiness"

Food was burnt

please do not order from this place horrible customer service.. instead of bharwa aloo they sent tandoori aloo...n my main order was delivered to someone else
The food was cold n stale . We ordered Chinese n the gravies were watery n looked like pre heated food . Over all waste of money n pathetic food .they should close the restaurant.
