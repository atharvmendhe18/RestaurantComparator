Review

No ghee and milk was given along with puranpoli which they usually do very saddened
I have a suggestion that they should provide pav with misal as it is one meal they just provide misal how do we come to know to order pav extra
incomplete order was received ispite of paying full payment
not worthy of the cost

Sukaa naral used instead of ola naral
"I have dined at this restaurant several other times and the experience has overall been quite satisfactory apart from slow service. But today they ruined it for me and I will never come here again or will recommend people to not come here! Infact I should file an official complaint with the food safety authorities. So here‚Äôs the problem:
1. We ordered Thalipeet. It had a broken human tooth in it.!! ü§¢ü§Æ
2. Next we ordered modak. The coconut used for making the modak was spoilt/expired.
This is very serious and has serious health and safety concerns! Please be careful and check your food before consuming. Lesson learnt."
In upavas misal if they provide some portion of Upavas Alo Sabzi it would be really better and overall taste is awesome

"bhakri was missing in the food had ordered 2 portions. .....

"Sugar in varan, kadhi and rassa as well. Very bad experience. Didnt know if we were eating food or very bad dessert."

"I have read many reviews here for Aaswad but this one can be trusted by any.
first thing first Ambience is very good, comfortable and then Secondly the staff is Friendly, polite and Helpful.

and now Let's talk about Food

1. Misal Pav (4/5) - You have to mention if you want spicy or else you will get regular which is Good too. service was pretty quick.
2. Kothimbir Vadi (4/5) - The highlight of this dish was the Dry Garlic chutney (which was 5/5). You can use that same chutney in your other dishes as well. It was mildly spicy and flavourful.
3. Puri Bhaji (3.5/5) - Puris were damm soo soft, light and less oily. best puris I have ever had in any restaurant, bhaji was bland but they...read more"
