excellently cooked and delicious.
"The food was really delicious although a little more of oil on all its dishes.. don't miss out on their rawa masala dosa and falooda.

Decent food and decent prices."

"Good restaurant, quick service and decent ambience.

Best dish is Puneri misal and kokam sarbat.

But I feel that the oil content in the misal is too much. It should be reduced."

"Near dadar station its really nice hotel

I tried pav bhaji and its very good quantity and quality.
Good staff behaviour.
Ample seating.
Worth of money."
"Our Family has been dependent on this place for years... Food is Alwaysss good n has Alwaysss been very Pocket Friendly for yearsss... Will absolutely recommend jalfrezi if you like big chunks of veggies in the gravy like Khada Pav Bhaji. BUTTT if You like Well crushed gravy go for paneer makhanwala ,kolhapuri or Pasanda.
All are Great.....!!! Bon Apatite. üíú.."

"Have been going to Adarsha as it is quite close to Dadar station west and is ideal to meet up with friends!! Have loved their misal and thalipeeth thruout.. We spent only about haf hour on a weekday evening..Had dropped in for snacks..For some reasons.. The thalipeeth n kothambir wadi is off the menu but is served if u ask.. Visited after lockdown and loved the revamped look.. Full AC.. Cool vibes.. Pictures of Mumbai n festivals.. However when interiors are changed to welcome young crowd.. So shud the mentality of the management..
While having tea the bill was placed before us.. Even though the restaurant was quite empty..
After dat the waiter was constantly standing over our heads to...read more"
"Hotel location is good just walking from Dadar station in West , the hotel is very clean and beautiful from inside. Pav Bhaji was amazing.Dosa was not uptothemark"
"Just WOW.. fresh food, great taste and superb service.... one of the best food stop for Dadarkars..... everyone must try..."
"Delivery of food was superb, food was well packaged, hot and fresh. Will definitely order next tym, Thank you for great service, keep doing it."
"It is well-known food destination in Dadar. Moreover It is amazing place specially for pavbhaji lovers. Taste, quantity and freshness of the food was above expectations. Must try, highly recommended."
"Small old restaurant tucked in the lanes of dadar market, Adarsha will provide you with authentic maharashtrian as well as North Indian food, dirt cheap prices and good quantity and quality.

The only concern I had was misal should always come with Pav, they charged me even for the pav which generally comes with Misal, I don't mind paying for extra pav, but let the first ones be with the dish. Its a typical standard everywhere in Mumbai.

Otherwise the taste was amazing, the sharbat was great vey refreshing."
"This place is located very close to Dadar Station thus it becomes a very crowded place.
Service is too quick with prices very reasonable"
"Been there today


Pleasant ambiance with good service


Food was average though it‚Äôs value for money

It‚Äôs very economical!"
This restaurant serves some delicious Vada and Tea. Both Vada and Tea are much recommended. Quality and service both were good
"We ordered misal pav in which the misal had more of coconut taste,not at all good never order misal pav because here this is no concept of misal and pav you have to pay different for misal and different for pav. Would never recommend this hotel."
Since I was a kid I have been going to this place. In fact their Misal is one of the best. Better than some of the other named ones in the area. Also Kothimbir vadi and Dalimbi Usal Puri. My standard fare with sweetemblica...
"very famous hotel in the middle of dadar !! The hotel is very famous for Misal !! they have different type of misal such as puneri misal, special misal! and also we have ordered Thalipit which was crsipy and taste!"

We tried Uttapam Pizza and it was Amazing... would love to visit again to try more dishes üëçüëçüëç
Your service was very good the dishes were too yumm we both love it the food was very fresh the taste of the food was very yam the briyani was cooked properly we both love it
Good place to try mumbai food dishes..A good place to hop in with your family. After shopping this place satisfied our hungry tummy.So we tried kotambir wadi and pav bhaji which was good enough.
"We took a parcel of Adarsh Special Misal...as when asked which will be medium spicy out of puneri or adarsh special, the manager recommended Adarsh Special Misal.
He did duly informed us that misal is exclusive of pav n need to order it separately.
To our surprise the misal was sweet and had slight under tone of spice.
The kat or gravy was made of onion n potato while the farsan had kande pohe, pulses onion and farsan which they packed together the farsan went absolute soggy.
If you like sweetish misal this is the place. Unfortunately, it did not please our taste buds!!!"

"Best place to eat with family and friends. I reached in hotel adarsha and order some vada sambar and bhajni thalipeeth . Bhajni thalipeeth was delicious and tasty.

Kolhapuri Missal, Pizza Uthappa, and mouth watering Pav Bhaji were amazingly tasty.To add to our happiness was the perfectly prepared Sole Kadhi which was just an icing on top.We would definitely recommend this restaurant and personally visit again and again."
Ambience is very good and food was also tasty. We had ordered Paneer Tikka masala and Veg kolhapuri with butter Nan. Taste was very good but quantity wise little less. Service was also good and fast.

We can order any kind of food but its with maharashtrian taste, super tasty with refreshing ambience.

Very close to my place and my go-to restaurant when I'm coming home late. It's been renovated lately and the taste of food is also improved. If you are a maharashtrian food lover this place has got it all!!
The place is nice and so is the food...we ordered fruit salad and veg pulav...both the dishes were tasty...also the quantity for the food is satisfying in a reasonable price..
"Great place to have lunch or snacks or even some refreshment beverages. Clean and warm vibes.

Waiters are well trained and are very professional. Food was amazing and ate and liked things i would normally skip at home. 

Would def go back here for more."
"Adarsh Is an Typical Maharashtrian Outlet Located in Dadar West, Walking 2 mins from Dadar Station.
If you are hungry AF and Searching for a Maharashtrian Restaurant! Don't think directly go for Adarsh because People are more likely to visit here.There may be waiting,especially on Weekends!
The Ambience gives an Absolute idea of Mumbai City! The Posters and Paintings are So Classy! üåü
It's an Maharashtrian Restaurant so Misal, Dal Khichdi and stuff are Too Good! Also Milkshakes are So damn Mouthwatering!!As this outlet is not new, It's on from long back!! So people are very well-known about the Taste‚ô•
The Staff is Coordinating.

Food:5/5

"This restaurant is another hidden gem in dadar for vegetarian menu. If you compare the other two famous restaurants in the locality with this place, you will definitely choose this restaurant for it‚Äôs taste and price

What did we had ?

1. Pav bhaji : Flawlessly tasty, perfectly yummy cooked and spiced with plenty amount of butter

2. Veg Thali : Presentation will drool you and taste will impress you, there were three sabji one of potatoes and other of paneer which was fresh both the gravy were tasty and in good quantity, dal is simple yet amazing. Raita was delicious as anything. Gulabjaam was served only one, quantity of rice whifh comes along with thali was satisfying. I‚Äôm surely...read more"
"Adarsh restaurant is one of the oldest restaurants in Dadar that serves ""Maharashtrian"" food to their customer. This restaurant is situated near Dadar station. (Opposite to Nakshatra mall). Visited this place last week with my friend for lunch.

This restaurant is especially known for its snacks like a kothimbir wadi, misal pav etc.

This place is newly renovated. This place gives you fresh vibes and wonderful Mumbai theme is very unique. This place is always crowded on weekdays as well as weekends.

Staff is very good and the service is very fast. Pocket-friendly rate.

We ordered paneer tikka masala and garlic naan, both are really good in taste.

"I'm extremely bad at deciding what to order when alone at home and usually end up making Maggi or ordering McDonald / Carter Blue Shawarmas.

This time thought of going veg and best option to mind was Pav Bhaji. Again, didn't wanted to waste time on searching best Pav Bhaji serving outlet near Mahim and Zomato Offers made it easier, so ended up ordering from Adarsh.

Well, it was a delight neither was it a disappointment is all I could say.

It is not advisable to rate a restaurant over just 1 dish that too ordered once, definately deserves many more chances..

However, my first experience was :

Food Taste & Quality - 3/5
Packaging - 5/5
Quantity - 5/5
