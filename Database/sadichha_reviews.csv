Review
"Worst food proportions in fish surmai thali, taste was bland, Sol kadhi wasn't stored in hygienic state. I am suffering from throat infection the next morning"
"Ordered Prawns masala thali.
The prawns were clearly stale. Anyone could easily tell on their first bite. Plus the prawns were very tiny. Not at all worth dining."
"I never seem to tire of this place, it holds as much attraction for me as the scores of times I have visited earlier. The Surmai Thali, with a large and chunky stake of the premium fish, dunked in the orange coconutty gravy, and accompanied with the ruddy pink ""soul""-kadi simply makes the day. The Prawns thali, with the freshest gobs of kolambi in a darker, thicker onion-based gravy is equally, equally winsome. Not very heavy on the pocket, honest-to-God authentic, and cocking a snook at the Maheshes and the Gajalees.

We entered at 7 pm so no crowd and it has social distancing in place. They take ur temp and note ur name number. Impressed w service and turn around time.

Probably had higher expectations ... Ended up at 2.5/5."

Biryani was a total failure. It was as good as a pulao. Quite sad to see people calling something so far from a biryani as pulao. Biryani needs to have the flavour of spices which are slowly cooked and absorbed by the rice to be felt in each spoonful of it.

"very expensive, rs 400 thali had 3 bhakaris, and three pieces of mutton in dry gravy. Height was, no onion slices were given, why because onion are expensive nowdays for rs 100 kg. What kind of logic is this, i mean u r charging 400 for a thali, qnd u cannot provide onion slices, its a real shame, would recommend Highway Gomantak, just 50 mtr away from it but 1000 times better, rates are cheaper there and yes they provide onion Slices irrespective of market rates"

"Malwani food is one which touches your soul.
Sadichha in Bandra is known for serving amazing malwani dishes.
They have quite decent ambience and a prompt and jolly staff. Their menu is loaded with finger licking fish
thalis , starters and many other. The food quantity and quality go hand in hand . The food is at quite affordable rates.
So in all it is a bumper delight for you and all your loved. ones"
"A childhood favourite, we had almost forgotten about this one. We couldn't help but try all the classics, from bombil fry to Sol kadhi, everything was just as we remembered it. The Chicken Sukkha with vade is packed full of flavour and just the right amount of spice. The Prawn Biryani had plenty of plump prawns. perfectly cooked. The Bombils were cooked just the way we like it, crisp on the outside, melting on the inside."
"Sadhicha

Surmai masala 2‚≠êü§®
Surmai was fresh but masala tasteless why im saying that because i can't feel surami taste in that masala

Tasty soft and light

Chicken biryani 3‚≠êü§©
Little bit different taste not like tipikal biryani only they have to increase masala quantity üòã"
Recently I ordered prawns briyani and I was highly disappointed. It was just prawns gravy added to rice and there were too many prawns in the rice. I wouldn't recommend prawns briyani atall.

Mind blowing chicken masala and all chicken starter special the chicken sucks and chicken masala was yummy And tasty and the chicken liver was very tasty too
"Had been here 7 years back and i remember having excellent Aamras puri, yes you read that correct. Chanced on dinner last night and was happy not much has changed since. Bombil fry was fresh and nice. Crab thali was good, with the bhakri beinf served hot. Jawla sukha was good too and finally the very likeable Kharvas to end on a sweet note. Service is nice and ambience is fine too. At 1100 for the meal, id say it is pretty reasonable"
"Amazing food with authentic malvani taste.....
....Khoop chan - food, service....
..Mouth watering and amazing sea food
Love the food
Must go place with family and friends...

"We had gone to Sadichha last Friday for team lunch. Service was prompt and was Food was good and tasty. We called for quite a few of dishes and each one was good with zero complaints .
Food ordered : sol kadhi, surmai fry, fried prawns, Bombil fry in starters. Followed by Prawns Masala thali, chicken sukha, clams, prawns Briyani. We ended our meals with Aamras n kulfi. Highly recommended"
"Sadichha is a nice restaurant for seafood and Malvani cusine. Ambience is bacis, nice ac section. Service is good. The prawns thali I tried here was nice. The brinjal vegetable I tried here was really tasty. They serve some nice roti to enjoy your meal. Other then all the seafood for a vegetarian side I would really suggest the brinjal."
"Must try - prawns, mutton sukha, vade
Must not try - biriyani

It's a place to get authentic maharashtrian veg and non veg food especially the Thali.
Prawns and mutton sukha are absolutely yes yes. Biryani will dissapoint you as its nothing but rice and mutton curry mixed."
"People who love malvani food must visit this place. They serve amazing fish. The most important thing is the fish has to be fresh and they serve fresh and cleaned fishes.
I‚Äôve also posted the bill image to get an average cost of having dinner with family
This place is worth having fish."
It was just a family dinner. My dad choose this place. nad I must say his taste is as good as mine üòù . Perfect family hotel. Best indian non veg dishes I had in a while.
"Sadhicha
Decided to plan for a dinner just because my sister was in Town.She wanted to try out some Fish Cuisine.I usually visit this place with my family.We went after along time and i noticed one change over there.Before there was both AC & Non-AC seating available at the restaurant.But now they have only AC seating available.If you are a Fish lover or want to try Konkani Food this outlet is for you guys.You can visit this place with your family.Not too Shady.And if you dont like fish then there is also Chicken dishes available in there Menu with some konkani touch.

Talking about my experience,genuinely i don't like fish so much.I would prefer chicken if it is available.As per my...read more"
"Family restaurant ,enjoy the konkani dishes surmai fry,kombdi wade,etc in goan style also various dishes most popular konkani food.for food 3.5/5"
"This is a spot you must try if you like your seafood with masala. Do not skip the Crab masala, tisrya masala, fried bombil and mutton sukkha. You can get these as thaalis or just a dish. Fried Surmai is also delicious.

The fried prawns are skippable. They aren't bad but not the best either.

Aam Ras is available during summer too!"
It‚Äôs place you feel around home food aroma once enter this place and hungry before the food is served in your table . The master piece is the food is platted in such way you would jump in imd to finish imd. Mouth watering and delicious food once should not miss to visit and experience
"This place is great for seafood. They serve fresh prawns, pomfret and Bombay duck. You will find this place very good. Please give it a try."
"One of the best for malvani thali you will get here. This is my all time constant place for malvani thali. As i am a fish lover I just love this place. It is situated right opposite to MIG club. They have a decent ambience. And this place is always crowded with people. Their service is pretty good. I would highly recommend to try out this place! ‚ù§Ô∏è
A must try to their :
üî∏ Chicken sukha thali
üî∏ Fry surmai
üî∏ Pomfret thali
üî∏ Prwans curry thali
üî∏ Fried prawns
This thali comprises of yummy Solkadi, spicy liquid, coconut chutney.

"Sadichha is a small Malwani restaurant just opposit MIG Cricket Club that serves excellent home style food. They specialize in Seafood. I was there for lunch yesterday along with a friend. Ordered a Surmai Fish Thali, Bombil Fry, Surmai Fry, along with Sukha Jawla and Solkadi.

Every dish was well prepared and tasty but the Bombil Fry and Sukha Jawla was exceptionally good. Enjoyed every bit of it. A big thumbs up.

An excellent place for a good home cooked meal during office lunch hrs.

Ambiance- 4/5
Food -5/5
Cleanliness- 4/5
Value for money -4/5"
"Great place to eat any fish thali. Authentic taste and very courteous service.

What you will get:-
1. Big portion of fish on a plate.
2. Authentic Malvan taste
3. Great service
4. Reasonable as per serving & quality

What is awaited:-
1. Parking space (Is not available mostly in Mumbai anyways)
2. Extra leg room in sitting area

Overall must try"
Food is really good but the service is not that great...........................I have ordered surmai fry which was really good but chicken thali was really bad
We ordered chicken masala priced at 200++ which was just a small bowl of chicken curry and fried bombil had all the oil in the world on it. They served us as if they didn't wish to serve us. The person who attended our table was rude enough to remind us the price of the chicken curry.This is worst bombil fry i have ever had.Worst service ever
"You wanna feel cheated while you pay for the expensive thali ? Please visit this place called *Sadichha* , where menu & service is decided by owner‚Äôs iccha ( will ). For me its the first malvani place in mumbai who doesn‚Äôt serve fried fish in a thali. For fried fish you gotta buy a special thali by paying 200 Rs extra !! Doesn‚Äôt even serve wade in thali as option.
Finger bowl is also given to few customers.
Expensive!! Expensive!! Expensive!!
Pathetic!! Pathetic!! Pathetic !!"
"Located right opposite MIG Club at Bandra East, this small restaurant dishes out some amazing seafood. Not too expensive, this is good place to fill your stomach. Food Tip- Better go there early, as it‚Äôs very crowded at lunch time."
"One of the best place for malvani thaliüòç. Silent decent ambience. Staffs are very polite. Dishes here are mouth watering.
One of my favourite place for malvani food. Seafood lovers highly recommended for u guys to try out this place. It will surely satisfy ur seafood cravings, with pocket friendly price.

They serve some amazing finger Licking dishes.
And my constant favourite order here are-

"Had been here for dinner with my family. Good food especially the seafood starters.
Small restaurant but good ambience.
Not too expensive.
Service was quick."
"Excellent place for Malwani food. You know what to expect. Order a fish thali as per your preference. Quantity is not too much but they don‚Äôt serve fried fish along with it. The solkadi was mild and just right. The kharvas was among the better ones I have had. The prawns fry, kombadi vade and prawns curry was excellent.

Overall a very good place for seafood."
I had the surmai thali which contains 2 to 3 smalls pieces of the fish in gravy with sol kadi chapati and rice and red chutney.good taste but not vfm.Also had the surmai fry which was well cooked but the price is APS.So check and order.All in all good but pricey.Efficient service.
"Such a beauty this place is in the by lanes of Bandra East near the MIG club. Very humble and neat little place with seating place for no more than 25-30. Being a pure vegetarian had the veg thali....was almost like home food.....basic masalas, good preparation and just the right quantity....the rice bhakri that I had ....must say was the best I have ever had....the fruit custard....isn't to be missed at all.....sad that I had it in the end else would probably have compromised on rice and had an extra portion of the fruit custard.

My colleague tried the prawns thali and stuffed pomfret and he was extremely pleased with his choice too

The service is nice and quick and pricing is very...read more"
"At Bandra East and craving Malvani food, close your eyes and walk in here. One of the best Malvan thalis served here. The joint looks small and maintained averagely but food is amazing. Fish is a must try here (Surmai recommended). After your sumptous meal, don't forget to end it with 'Solkadhi' to get your gastric juices in action !"
üòçThis place is close to the station road... The ambience just adds to the taste of the food. The waiters are warm to converse with as well as ready to help. Getting back to the most important category... The price is worth the taste and quantity. In fact it is very reasonable. And the quantity is massive. Had ordered #peppergarlicburntrice. One plate was shared by 3 good eaters. You get all types of cuisines here. But if you are a fan of rice roti and Indian dishes this place is a must try.‚ô•Ô∏è
"The restaurant has good fish dishes. Best for ordering in, as the ambience is not too great for a dining out experience. Very reasonable prices though."
"Just visited this place, it smelled terrible, we had ask for air fresher twice. We ordered chicken thali,pomfret thali,1 rawa fried prawns & 2 solkadi.
Chicken thali-chicken was stale n tasteless.
Pomfret thali-was the most horrendous preparation I have had in my life time.
Prawns-were not rawa fried & were loaded with baking soda.
Solkadi-had no taste at all.
Was waste of Rs.1150, utterly disappointing.Minus 5 rating if that was an option."
got there after seeing the rating and reviews .food was tasteless . chicken curry and solkadi was the worst .price is ok.coconut chutney had only salt in it no chilly .
"Sea food at this place is mind blowing. Best surmai fry I ever had was at Sadichha. Other than sea food their mutton kheema was also nice.
Price-3.5/5
Taste-5/5
Ambience-4/5"
"Yes 1star.. that too because of the Bombil (bougainvillea) fry else would given a zero for today's experience! :(
The Chicken Biryani's quantity was absolutely poor. The chicken pieces were hard, u can check that in images I've uploaded.
Another bullshit thing was 1 cannot share their food with the one U've come there with!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yess thisz true.. i.e. they just don't allow u to order 1thali if u r planning to share with ur friend!
Regretted today's visit to this hotel and surely dis was my last visit!
And the Attitude of the manager was kinda rude as well as he said again n again 'no u cannot share!'

"Sadichha is a popular restaurant near MIG club in Bandra (E) serving delicious Konkani & Malvani dishes in particular lip smacking seafood. The restaurant is an old school coastal diner with its furniture & decor. You cannot miss the seafood delicacies especially the Bombil fry & Prawns. The Thalis served are simple but satisfying. I loved the Coconut Chutney which had the right amount of spice. The Solkadi also had a good combination of ginger, spice & tanginess. The Malai Kulfi & Kharvas was the perfect dessert to finish the meal. Overall an amazing experience. I must add the staff is very courteous and the service is pretty prompt even during peak times.

I had crab thali. The crab was not fresh. The curry they served was also cold. Sadly they don‚Äôt give fry Fish in thalis.Have to order separately. Overall average food. Ambiance is good.
"Thanks to my friend Piyush who recommended this place .

Homely food and fish in all form is what you must order surely.

Go there early to grab a seat as it doesn't have many covers for people.

An awesome place for pure Maharashtrian Food."
"Overall quality of ingredients not up to the mark. They should improve on quality of spices they are using
Solkadi was so watery that never like to have again"
"Under-rated and lesser known than some of it's more famous neighbours like Highway Gomantak, Sadiccha is a real gem. Excellent service and super food. Fabulous range. Don't miss their stuffed pomfret. To die for. And, the fruit custard to finish the meal."
"Food is ok..quatity is little less but one thing which drags me here is fruit custurd....super delicious!!!
So you should definately go once and try this super mouth watering dish once..loved it!!!!"

"A bit overpriced but If you are okay with that then go ahead.if you are looking for typical malwani food, you should definitely visit here
My fav is surmai thali , surmai fry, chicken sukkah with wade and bombil fry :)"
Staff is very good ... good ambience .. food is strictly ok .. We had ordered for prawns thali and chicken thali .. chapati was not soft and the chutney given in thali was too spicy with no taste. Prawns curry was ok ok .
"I just had lunch here.
We ordered two fish thali. Fish thali doesn't include fry fish. You get fish in gravy. So ordered separate fry fish for it.
1. Gravy fish doesn't even had any taste at all.
2. Fry fish was not at all malvani style

Highly disappointed with fish
Not worth of 900+ bill for just two persons."
"If non veg is your weak point and you want to really try some good taste of Maharashtrian non veg food then this is a must place to visit .
You can simply try anything from chicken to fish and you simply fall in love with it ."
Evn 1 star is too much.. Dnt evn think to try.. Not at all worth.. Had Orderd fry bombay duck I think they forgot put the fish in there masala and i think oil is free for them. Then the 2nd dish was prawns masala and it was same like the 1st one so small prawns i thought i was eating onion tomato ka bhaji.. üòÇ so dnt waste money better go to modern in sion..
"Really bad experience. I went there with a friend and since we weren‚Äôt too hungry we decided to share a fish Thali to which the management flatly refused ., they said we had to compulsorily buy 2 Thalis. We were anyways giving the valuation of the amount equivalent to 2 Thalis by ordering extras. We had to leave And they didn‚Äôt even care !"
Craving seafood? Rush to Bandar to this place they serve authentic Marathi seafood. Price is little overpriced but it's ok to spend once a while
"Good place to eat Chinese, they quantity suits they're pricing... A very big restraunt.. they will serve you well ... Do try this place .. this is located near vakola bridge .."
nice service. good quality foods make good mood that type I feel when I go this hotel . I like non-veg specially fish so I enjoyed the food . assal malvani jevan
"A Maharashtrian nonveg thali place located opp. MIG cricket club still preserves the small & cozy seat sharing concept during peak hours. Order any thali, but do check with the manager on whats fresh. So far have tried chicken, pomfret, surmai, bombil, prawns & have loved the freshness of meat. Their vade‚Äôs are crisp & big but come at an extra cost in thali. Semi dry garlic coconut chutney is superb to have with vade"
"when in bandra going to sadichha is must .... bombil fry , eukha chicken , and thali is all time good. Never disappoints about the taste always awesome."
"Very cozy place,
Nice food
Try their prawns Sukha - its not spicy
Their chi sukha is good too
Very quick in service
Approx 400 to 500 per person

Just had a delicious lunch here!! I had a chicken suka Thali for me and veg Thali for my Mum.. I was hungry so was not able to take a picture of the Thali and started of with my lunch!! I must say it was one of the best chicken suka I have had in years!!! Mum was happy with her veg Thali as well... I will make visit there soon!!!
"Pls check the quality of the Fish before eating, they served us stale food. The cook agreed but the person seating at the cash counter denied.

They have lost the ethics and trust, we have been eating here for 20 years.

I don‚Äôt recommend.."
"I am giving 1 star overall
Small uncomfortable sitting

Reasons

1) taste was not worth price
2) arrogant staff
3) service issues
4) price higher for food they provide
5) no fry fish in thali was served

I suggest owner to visit (Chaitanya restaurant , Prabhadevi) and taste food.
And improve your food quality"
"Went to this place for lunch from office with a colleague, the place is bang opposite to MIG Club in Kala Nagar. The outlet is too tiny, it‚Äôs like you blink nu miss it.

The place is usually full as the seating capacity is pretty small maybe around a max of 18-20 ppl.

They serve authentic Malpani cuisine. I am not into sea food so I usually call for Chicken Thali. This time around I ordered for Chicken Sukka Thali. They serve 2 chapatis, rice, chicken in thick brown gravy, brown gravy, Sol kadhi n coconut chutney in orange colour with onion n lemon. I‚Äôd also recommend the wada which is poori made from rice batter goes really well with the chicken.

The sol kadhi was ok not so good...read more"
"Greatest sea food, the sea food taste is irreplaceable for me, the bombil fry of this place is ""state of art"" and a must have. But I. Would like to request the owner to make it a little comfortable to sit, the benches are are squeezy but no complains about the food... Cheers.."
One of the best restaurants for Sea Food.. Superb Quantity.. Bombil Fry.. Prawns Fry..Jawla (Dry Prawns) Chatni... Kombdi Wade..Chicken Sikka...n to end with Solkadi... not to miss Prawns Biryani...
"I love this place since childhood üòçüòç
One of the best place!!!
1. Fish Thali
2. Chicken Thali
3. Chicken Liver Thali
4. Prawns Thali(sorry the picture got deleted)
5. Kharvas
Everything was just perfect. Good place."
"Had visited Sadichha many but this had to write a review of this exellent cozy place opp mig club Bandra this place has a great menu mostly seafood is great eg prawns fish and crabs this time I tried crabs to my surprise it was great and I loved it
To the funny side it was a hard work breaking the crab but it deserved ....üòÄ"
"The food quality is average, and overpriced. Bombil fry, fish Thali, chicken sukka and rawas fry is what we ordered, and it was satisfactory. The solkadi was good, and we ended up ordering more of it. One of the most irritating things was the waiter constantly saying that the Thali cannot be shared ( which is funny considering the thali portion size isn't good enough even for one), and on top of that they keep looking like a hawk to ensure the second person is not even tasting from it.Overpriced food, average taste, Ridiculous rules and disappointing service.

Wouldn't recommend a visit here."
Decent place in suburbs of Mumbai. Visited this place on a friend's recommendation. May be the best for non vegans. I dint find any veg options on the menu. loved their Kulfi. It's too good and must try item on the menu.
"It's awesome local (read coastal maharastra) cuisine at highly affordable prices. Dig into the komdri (chicken) wade and bombil fry, or just order a prawns thali (if you have a big appetite) and add a Rawas fry. Or simply go with mutton or chicken sukhe with bhakri. Wash it all down with Solkadi - quite satisfying! And if it's summer, please don't miss the aam ras (mango speciality from maharastra). The ambience is very simple and there is no aircon - but the food makes up for it all."
"I have been visiting quite a lot seafood places recently. & came across This joint through my friends suggestion. First of all I am maharashtrian & Malwani cusine is our staple food. It was a let down when they call themselves Malwani speciality restaurant but most of dishes are made as konkani style. Less coconut. Mild spice Thin gravies Applying Semolina on fried fish are not Malwani style. Neverthless the food taste was satisfactory.

Another let down is their Ala carte fish prices which are highly overpriced. Neverthless Thali prices are VFM. The joint is relatively small & gets too crowded in peak hours. Would recommend to be early bird. & enjoy the food.

"Ummm.. not so good not bad either. Had ordered small surmai( was big for me), taste wise: The fish wasnt properly marinated in Marathi I'll say"" raptavlay "". Small and decent place with fairly lights(festive effect??). I traveled almost 15_20 kms im search of this hotel; but didn't meet my expectations. A ""can do better"" suggestion from my end."
"One of the best places for Malvani food. Amazing delicious food that will fill you stomach but not your intention.

A must try is the chicken sukha along with the bhakri.

They also do delivery orders... so definitely try it out."
"My favorite place to eat the typical malwani cuisine, the entire restaurant is air conditioned now. The food is awesome my favorite is the sukhhya tisrya masala and prawns fried in Rawa. Solkadi with the meal goes without saying."
"Tried this place for the first time. Their speciality is seafood and it is very good. The crab masala we had was mouth watering. They sever authentic malwani food. The thali are filling and tasty.

Place to go if you are craving for seafood."
"It definitely is an ancient place , consistency they have maintained in terms of spicy food they serve . But their fruit custard definitely has deteriorated in taste .
The clams were not opened , in a dish there were quite a few clams that were not served correctly .
But what I liked is they were receptive to listening to us .
I enjoyed their rotis made with rice ."
