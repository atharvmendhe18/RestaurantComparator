Review
"This little ""hole in the wall"" place is a landmark in Bandra. Located at the junction fo Pali Hill market and Dr. Ambedkar Road, this small restaurant has been serving Parsi food with a friendly, family feel to locals for years.

On my recent visit, I brought a couple from the US (Indian wife, Gora husband) here as the first stop in my guided culinary tour of Mumbai. We were not disappointed. The dhansak was flavored to a tee, not too bland, not too spicy, with a rich mix of vegetables coming through in the sauce and with tender mutton chunks.

The murgi boti was quite satisfying, as well. We didn't have room or time for the lagan nu caramel custard, but on past visits, my dining...read more"
Lagan Nu Custard is great too.
"A lovely place for mutton lovers (other non veg is also available), mutton salli boti is mouth watering, kheema, cutlets are really delicious. I'm sure you'd never be able to have what's there on the menu at once and you'll go back as you will get addicted with the taste! #mutton #snacks #kheema #nonveglove #life"
"I hav been eating from this place for the last ten years. The food is parsi cuisine apart from that sandwiches hotdogs and rolls are also available. The chicken salli boti, prawn pattya, chicken farcha and dhansak are superb he also sells brown rice and berry pulav. Desserts also include parsi dairy kulfi and laganu custard. The club sandwich and the puffs are also fresh. The sandwich is pretty filling its loaded with ham shredded chicken cheese boiled egg and slaw. Definitely worth a visit."
"Just came out of this place, disappointed ..! ordered for a ham and cheese burger with a alot of expectation , however ended up getting a dried bun with a boiled ham and raw cheese, it didn’t even look nor taste like a burger"
"I have been to this place in Pali Naka for more times than I could choose to count. This place counts among the dwindling number of establishments serving Parsi cuisine in Mumbai, more so in the burbs. While the old Irani places are morphing into populist eating establishments serving an ambiguous demographic, Ashmick’s is the torch bearer of authentic Parsi cuisine. I am saddened by the fact that it is not as much patronized by the Bandra crowd that once did and, as a result, its very existence may be in jeopardy.

Moving on, Ashmick’s is a café with limited patio-type seating. It gives you the feeling of a street side café and what better setting than Pali Naka. The temporary...read more"
"Went for a quick bite in the evening.
Small place with minimum seating but man the things we ordered were amazing.
Though it's a parsi cuisine place, didn't have it.
Ordered chicken puff, amazing taste , the chicken sandwich was good and crisp with lot of chicken filling.
Next had their in house burger, well made and nice sauce.
So overall had a great experience, next time will try the parsi cuisine.
Pricing is very pocket friendly."
"Went last evng fr a snack. Picked up cutlets which had an overdose of ginger garlic paste, were raw the covering of batter was missing, the chicken roll had mayonnaise which had water added to it so watery and the chicken puff was ok. Wud not recommend you to try their food."
I’ve been taking parcel from here from a long time.. a good friend recommended the chicken club sandwich and I’ve for some reason only tried that all these years.. I have heard good thing about their Parsi Food but yet to try it..
This place is situated on the busy Pali street in Bandra West. I went with a lot of expectations but the food was way below average. The Dhansak rice was really not upto the mark and I felt the taste was too much like some artificial tastemaker. I have many Parsi friends and hence taste authentic Parsi food regularly and am sorry to say this is not close.
A great place for Parsi food.. Chicken farcha and Sali Boti were delicious! The burgers are great for a heavy evening snack and remind you of a lovely homemade burger.
"Visited here some time back, looking for parsi food like we usually have in fort area like military cafe, excelsior, etc. 

While the food wasnt close to expectations, it was decent. 

We tried the mutton salli, dhanshak and 1 chicken dish and all 3 were mediocre. Only thing is that it was served fresh and hot. Havent been there again.

Will surely give it a try once again to explore if they have some other tongue tingling dishes to offer!"
"Unbelievably good Parsi food! Recommend the prawn biryani and the salli boti for any saturday afternoon chill out movie days.
Eating at the makeshift restaurant adds to the entire experience too!!"
This place is a small takeaway place opposite Punjab Sweet House. Their chicken puff is delicious and the best part is that they share the space with tibbs. A must try there is the Chicken Tawa Frankie.
"My go to spot for a quick snack, the Chicken and Mutton puff is always on point. A friendly owner combined with homely preparations makes this a good spot, for snacks. I haven't tried the mains from here or any of the signature Parsi items."
"Ashmick's Snack Shack is a tiny eating joint located on the busy Dr. Ambedkar Road in Bandra West. Nestled among the biggies, this place serves quite yummy, homely food.

Nothing much in terms of ambiance; it is a small little thing with a few tables but amazing food. We ordered the chicken tikka grilled sandwich and fish cutlets; both superb and with complete value for money.

Note, this place is pretty famous for their Parsi delicacies. Will try those the next time. Keep it up!"
"Very disappointed. They even got the simple mutton curry wrong. The mutton kababs were hard on both the inside and out. The farcha was not well marinated and more oily than necessary. The pulao dal was mediocre.
Has such great potential for Parsi food as there’s nothing in the area but they botched it."
Excellent Parsee Food must try mutton briyani it's awesome and please keep up the good workactually all the Parsee food is excellent.Ahura Mazda
"This, I feel was a complete waste. We ordered the Sali botti and the prawn pulao, and must say we were disappointed with the taste and the quality of the food.

I've definitely eaten better Parsi food than this."
"Been here twice... didn't have much the first time round, just a couple frankies and mutton puffs which were both pretty decent.

It was last week that we tried a proper meal, with a mutton salli boti and a chicken farcha. I also had a chicken curry rice with was quite alright. The salli boti was more of a goan dish - sweet and sour. The chicken Farcha was a pleasant surprise in the sense it was a mildly flavoured whole leg of chicken which is fried with an egg coating and is served with coleslaw and a boiled egg.

For the kind of place it is - just two tables that can seat around 8 - some might find it a little unfairly priced. But the food is simple and filling.

Its a nice place if...read more"
"So, yesterday turned out to be a Parsi Cuisine day in the family. While some relatives had a huge lunch catered by some Parsi specialists, a cousin cooked Dhansaak at home, and I ordered from my long time favourite, Mutton Dhansaak from Snack Shack.
As is the norm knowing my fondness for Dhansaak, my relatives and cousin sent me their respective left-overs.
Glad to say, Snack Shack was still the best out of the 3."
"Are you a foodie?
Do you like burgers? If your answer is yes then you must visit this Ashmicks at Bandra. Small and modest Parsi cafe whipping up traditional dishes plus sandwiches and my favorite Burgers. 

To all you foodies Ashmicks burger is a must try, filled with loads of chicken salami, cheese, tomatoes, mayo and lot more.

One bite and you feel heavenly, its not so heavy on the pocket and it gives value for every buck. Tantalizing and a must visit place…."
"For namesake its parsee food, its all dirty unhygienic food doesn't taste like parsi cuisine at all 💩💩💩 bad taste, stale food not fresh.. some catholic guy runs this place, waste of mony shit place"
"Not great. Had ordered chicken kheema sandwich, which contained only bread and kheema. No sauce, salads etc. And highly priced for some items."
It's a nice option for lunch if you're looking for stomach filling meal and not something fancy on Pali hill. I tried the Thursday specials chicken dhansak and mutton berry biryani which tasted quite good. They serve chicken farcha with boiled egg and salad.
"Food is good ....but plzzz don't try kulfis from here.....there are much much better option available.... the kulfi lacks in taste,flavour.... and has only water.... strictly not recommended"
"Very good authentic Parsi food
The patra fish is too good
The dhansak is the best I have enjoyed so far
The service is quite quick and good
Home delivery is also very efficient"
"I would eat anything here, all the time. Such an underrated place! It's a delight, budget friendly, and with great options. Chicken potato chops and chicken puff are superb, the cutlets are very good too.Looking forward to trying out all the non veg items. The bonus is the Tibbs Frankie station."
A no holds barred old school food shack which isn't heavy on your pocket. The food is strictly average but it is cheap and you can fill your tummy well. There are better bakeries around which can easily overshadow this one.
"Food heaven! Every time i find a place that serves good food in Bombay (yes Bombay) I feel indebted to them to write a brilliant review.
I went to snack shack absolutely famished and was glad i was as hungry.
The Mutton cutlets literally melt in your mouth and are seasoned to perfection.
Chicken Farcha was easily one of the most well done chicken i have eaten. Lightly seasoned, it was hard to place exactly why I couldnt stop eating except I couldnt. That one was wrapped up greedily!
Kheem per edu with chapati was yet another plateful of greed enducing deliciousness!
We ordered 3 things convinced that at least one wud fail us. None of them did and we ended up being confused about what...read more"
Horrible. The attitude of the guy is terrible. Its like he is doing a favor on us by delivering our food. Never going to order from this place. Minimum of 250 order for a distance of less than a kilometer is terrible. Hopeless
"Small place which serves Parsi cuisine. Though the tatse might not be aurhentic parsi one,but is still quite pleasant. Mutthon dhansak was quite tasty and so was aaloo mutter. Sali boti could have been better. Nice eat out option for a lazy and quick Sunday lunch."
"Nothing beats the authenticity of Parsi food at this place...

Been eating here for years now and every time I eat here, I walk out with a big smile..."
Best place to visit at pali hill....!!!! Best parsi cuisine i have ever had after a long time.....!!!!! Small restaurant but best taste ...!!! Even I would recommend to have fast food over there😋😋😋

Very small and basic set up... Food is simple and home made style.. . Bit over priced for the parsi food.... The frankie is very good......
"Snack Shack is a place very close to my heart. I used to walk up to the place when I could barely reach their table counter. I was one of their 1st customers and since then I have grown along with their food. One of the most under rated places in Bandra Ashmick's Snack Shack provides happiness through food.

The place that introduced me to Chicken Farcha, Chicken Dhansak, Salli-Per-Edu and Lagan Nu Custard at a very young age. I have been their loyal customer since the day I walked into their cafe on the very 1st day. Everyone at Snack Shack is my family and they have spoilt me with good food as a kid. On a weekend when I'm chilling at home Snack Shack is my take away place and if it's a...read more"
"Best place for Parsi food in Bandra. Although the place is small, the food is delicious. Must try out the Chicken Sali Boti and Prawn Curry rice. Definitely go on a Thursday or a Sunday to have the Mutton Dhansak. Also try out the famous Raspberry Soda to bring the whole meal together. Favourite place to go to either for lunch or for dinner."
Nice little joint. Had spotted the spot and stopped by for a light dinner but ended up filling ourselves to the T. Amazing food and nice service.
"Been visiting this place like since forever I remmbr.. Years back was a popular joint for parsi cuisine .. Small joint 2-3 tables .. Now they have frankie stall so more crowd comes for that .. But I wud suggest going there for their dhanshaks and Lagan nu custard 👍
Nice price factor .. If ambience is an issue do take parcel but must try for sure .."
"'Eat at a Parsi restaurant' was on my to-do list in Mumbai. But couldn't make it to the iconic Parsi places in the Fort area, due to time constraints. A little googling revealed this little place with a blogger mentioning his Parsi mother-in-law approved of this food. So went to this tiny three-table roadside hut for lunch.

Ambience and service are just about okay. It's clean and friendly enough to not be a turn-off.

Now the food. The legendary dhansak wasn't available, so we ordered
1. Keema-per-eedu, keema filled within a fried egg with a juicy yolk (soft but not runny, just the way I like it) served with a piece of roti. The keema was delicious and since this seemed like a 'manners...read more"
"Took a friend from Delhi out for a Frankie as a Bombay food, so it had to be Tibbs Frankie. Ashmicks is a cute little place in Pali market. If you're looking for ambience - don't bother going here. Interested in just the food, then yes. We had chicken and vegetarian frankies - cooked well, spiced perfectly and served relatively quick. Watch the generous portions of cheese on a Frankie if you've ordered one with cheese. Also, bonus points for stocking ice cream sodas."
"Two months back I'd have rated this joint a 4 for its brilliant salli boti and dhanshak, when I chanced upon it between two meetings in Pali. Yesterday I went again in full earnest. Ordered Patra Nu Machchi. Machchi came with the packet OPEN!  A pomphret placed on a banana leaf with an overdoze of over-sweet green chutney smacked all over the fish. The nightmare? The fish was UNCOOKED. Translucent and pink @ the bone. I could hardly eat 1/3 of the fish. But had to pay for the whole of it. Damages? 5 shocking hundred bucks! LOOT LIYA SAALA!  Never expected this from a  Bawa joint."
Best biryani and caramel custard... Value for money.. Fast delivery.. Have ordered from here quite often and they have maintained the food standard well..
"A decent small place that serves you authentic Parsi food! I tried their chicken n mutton biryani sautéed well with spices and their lagan nu custard soft and tender with right taste of sweetness...

The raspberry drink wasn't that great since it gave a pungent taste of a cough syrup.... You can try their masala soda...

Staff has 2 old men, and both r equally benevolent and courteous... The place is very much worth the money!"
A Good Small Place in Pali in Bandra West with Limited Variety of Parsi Food Available...As the Club Sandwich is one of the Amazing Stuff to have....Covered with ham and Cheese with Vegetables....The Chicken Dhansak is Good....As a small place there is very limited Tables Availble....as has the most Business comes as Take Away...would prefer this place not always....
Mindblowing food... been here couple of times. I reuest management to serve more Parsi varities and improve the seating arrengements. But let me tell you no other rests can beat this one. I can eat here all 365 days day & night.
"Parsi food has never delighted me to such an extent before. If you're ever at Pali Naka and looking for farcha, patra, custard and/or raspberry soda, this is where you should ideally go. It will satisfy your every need for Parsi food without a doubt.
This joint is bang opposite five spice and is a little difficult to find considering it's a very small place. The seating takes up about a third of the restaurant with kitchen taking up the rest of the space. Keep that in mind if you're planning to visit late evenings or afternoons, or you always have the option of takeout.
It is modestly furnished, but the ambience isn't what you should go here for. We ordered the anda chutney (egg covered...read more"
"Thumbs up: Parsi non-veg food, value for money, and Pali Naka's location. Thumbs down: Hygiene, lack of veg options, and rude service to veggies. Tip: Try the Sali boti or dhansak. Don't expect much in terms of ambience and you'll be fine."
"Mickey's place is loved by many people for their Parsi fare... I love it as well, but surprisingly for some of their other offerings which are usually treated like the kid that goes home with a prize for 'best behaved student'

In the chaos that is Pali Naka, this has always been my go-to place for a decent grilled sandwich... The ham & cheese in particular is a no fuss tasty snack as it should be. Also been fond of their pepper chicken sandwich. 

The other stuff that I like from here that others may have not cared about includes the chicken tikka roll (ask them to grill it). And would you believe it, they have one of the best chicken patties even though there are so many bakeries...read more"
"So here I was in between lunch time and way ahead of breakfast and bloody hungry, since I was near Pali naka and had not ever stepped into this place before I just went ahead with my gut feeling thinking its a nice quaint place to have food, especially since it's owned by a Parsi I knew the I omelette would be good.

So ordered a Omlette Sandwich not toasted, it took around 7-8min for it to come and yes it was hot and nicely made, couldn't resist so had to order for Chutney cheese sandwich which was also nice, the green chutney was very different and nice.

Guys I didn't try but should try the Paneer Akori and apparently the Dhansak is also kick ass."
"Excellent food and authentic parsi bhonu. Well priced.. I would prefer to order at home and enjoy the food as the place has limited sitting option. The salli boti and dhanshak were highlight, not to kiss the custard to top. A must visit"
"One of my fave places that I used to recall fondly even after I no longer lived in b'bay. So when I moved back, this was one of the 1st places that I headed to. Love the chicken cutlets, the chicken tikka pulao and the mutton sali boti. I also like the mutton dhansak but it is little too spicy for me for a regular meal. So I order that only if I am in the mood for something extra spicy. Gregory (the guy at the counter in a french beard) has been around for the last 10 years (which as long as I've been going to Ashmick's) and can always be relied on for great service and a good suggestion if you are wondering about the day's specials. Oh - and almost forgot to mention the laganu custard...read more"
One of the long standing Parsi restaurants in Bandra.. The Patrani Macchi is an absolute must have here.. I love ordering from here.. The service is quick and well packed..
"The only put off about this place is the rodent which kept showing up its ugly head while we tucked into our amazingly super chicken dhansak, spicy but perfectly cooked kheema per edu and the lovely mutton potato chops transported me back to lovely childhood memories of helping my mom make them. A definite must try place, the ambiance isn't anything to write home about but the food makes up for everything else. A takeaway or home delivery would be a perfect idea."
"Let me start by saying I LOVE PARSI FOOD. And this is just amazing: food is incredible , very reasonably priced and quick service for a quick bite!!
Ordered mutton puffs, chicken dhansak, kheema-par-edu, mutton cutlets and how can I miss this Lagan-Nu custard!!
Try it to believe it.
Thanks Michelle @rachelpereira"
"i just happened to  be in  this place just because  jai hind ( great place for  sea food ) was  closed .  the place is very small.but looked descent 

the menu looked good ,  so we ordered  fish  cutlets and potato chops , 

fish cutlets - super thin, no value  for money and v v ordinary

"With Navroz round the corner and having refused a couple of invites for Parsi dinners, I was craving to get a taste of Parsi food.

South Bombay is where all the best ones are, is what the staple reply to asking around was. I decided to find one out for myself and looked up parsi eating joints in Bandra. Since it was going to be the initiation for both of us, we decided to stick to light bites and see how it worked for us. This is how we chose between Ashmick’s Snack shack and Jumjojee. that and the chutney potato chops which just called to us.

We placed an order via an app and were rewarded by the on time delivery and an extra discount.

The food comprised of Paneer ni akoori, Veg...read more"
My experience here has been very good... Be it eating their Salli per eedu (Poached Egg on Potato Salli) or Be it Kheema Per Eedu (Poached Egg on Mutton Kheema)... Or Be it Ashmick's Special Burger... Or Ham and Cheese Burger or Omelette Sandwich... I love everything here...
Well its a parsi sort of cuisne and ok place food was also ok i ordered prawn biryani it was gud bt the owner os rude and non social didnt liked hos attitude
Amazing Parsi food and value for money too. MUST TRY Mutton Dhansag and potato cutlets filled with chiken and mutton kheema..................
"I've been frequenting Snack Shack right from my school days. There are Very few Parsi food options in the suburbs, and that's what makes Snack Shack stand out. A small no frills eatery, they have their specials like Dhansak and berry pulao only on specific days of the week, which I think is really unfortunate. 
Nevertheless, their food is delicious on the whole, barring any comparison to the Parsi restaurants in south Mumbai that offer far more authentic cuisine. You wont be disappointed with their kebabs and cutlets. I particularly love their sweet spicy sali chicken served with pav on the side. Or else get their Mutton Boti Burger which is an interesting fusion dish of the mutton boti...read more"
"Come here for comfort food and parsee specials.
The ambience is nothing to write about but the food is.
Choose from parsee traditional favourites like Akuri, Mutton Sali boti, Dhansak, Patra ni macchi, Kheema par edu (mince with an egg on top) drink the old time Rogers soft drinks like Raspberry, Ginger ale, Ice cream soda or simply go for their sandwiches.
The ashmicks non veg club sandwich comes loaded with ham, chicken, egg and cheese.
Pocket friendly and quick, its perfect for a meal on the go or a tea time snack."
"Good parsi food is not a common cuisine. At Ashmick you get just that.

Ashmick is located at Pali Naka, Bandra.

Mutton Pulav dal, Chicken farcha is highly recommended."
"Aahmick's snack shack is one of my haven when I'm starving at work. It's a tiny little arrangement which also has a Tibb's Frankie outlet. I absolutely lust after the Chicken Cheese Frankie which is the most delicious and unhealthy things :D


I've tried Lagan nu custard but it was completely different from the one I tried at Jimmy Boy as this one was very similar to caramel custard. So, I'm officially confused about the original.

Do try the Mutton Berry Pulao as that is pretty yummy however it's only served on Thursdays. The berry still remains a mystery but it blends beautifully with the mutton and rice. The mutton is very tender which is one hell of a task so kudos for that!"
Quaint little place amidst chaos at Pali market.. Serves some authentic Parsi food at fantastic prices.. Recommend strongly the kid ghost.. Succulent mutton blocks in a lovely white gravy.. Other favourites here include the Kheema with eedu (egg) and a decent version of the chicken farcha.. The chicken dhansak is very basic but with brown rice hits the right spots.. Eat in if brave.. More useful for takeaway and delivery!
Deserves a 4.5.. but its getting a 4 from me cause of the seating issue. All in all a great place to fill up on yummy parsi bhonu. Their chicken farcha's are a must try and makes a great afternoon snack along with the yummy chicken pattice.
"Am a huge fan of their Mutton Dhansak, Lagan nu custard and Salli Boti. the place is a little small, so we usually order home delivery. 
The best place to get Tibbs Frankies as well!"
"It was Navroze and we wanted to eat Parsi food. Problem was, we would be in Bandra on Saturday, with no chance whatsoever, to go to city for the Jimmy Boy or Britannia or even Paradise. And the other problem was, we didn’t know of any Parsi joint in Bandra, other than Jumjoji. Sought the help of Mumbai Twitterati, and sure enough! Soon got two names – Snack Shack in Pali Hill and RTI near Bandra Station. Pali Hill would be close and so settled for Snack Shack.

Twitterati also advised us to opt for a takeaway, since, they said, they place is woefully small for a meal there. We took their advise, called up the joint at 10 on Saturday morning and asked for the day’s special. Pat came...read more"
"This place serves some of the best, homemade style Parsi food I've had. The curries are spicy, flavoursome and well-balanced. The condiments marry the meat perfectly and leave your mouth watering. My favourites are Akori, Salli Murgi, Chicken Farcha and Lagan Nu Custard. Must visit for all those who enjoy authentic Parsi dishes!"
"A tiny little shack at Pali Naka junction.. Heard a lot about its Parsi dishes and is the only option available Bandra side, but it's worth it.!! Mutton sali boti and mutton Khema was delicious.. Also try out the ham and cheese grilled sandwich..quiet filling.."
