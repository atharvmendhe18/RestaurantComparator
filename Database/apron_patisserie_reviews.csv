Review
I wish I could give you'll a 6 out of 5. The fresh strawberry cake was amazing and my family and I actually ate it for 3 days and to our surpirse it was as fresh on day 3 too. Loved the overall presentation and I was surprised to received such a high end looking cake at this price.
"I found you on Instagram and took a chance on ordering your cake from the beautiful images and the customer appreciation comments and I was not disappointed at all. We had NO personal recommendations, we just stepped out on faith and we were overwhelmed by how delicious your cake turned out to be. Every face lit up with their very 1st bite of your cake. Cakes make events memorable and yours surely surpassed the job!"
"She makes wonderful cakes,my mom ,a senior citizen too loves her cakes,highly recommended....I have tried her cakes,muffins and pastries,her cake presentation, flavour, and all of it are very well flavoured leaving a taste for more...thanks dear ...."
"So for someone who is a Pure Vegetarian, who does not eat egg, this is the best thing I could have asked for as the cakes are eggless and gelatin free. But that's not the only reason to like a cake or pastry. The most important thing is the taste. The satisfaction to the palate is something you will find with Apron Pattiserie's cakes. Have had some amazing cakes from here and it is definitely recommended."
"Its was great experience , the pastries whr amazing my daughter was just keep on eating ðŸ’• and the cake for the birthday was superb .. Will suggest my friends"
"Since my daughters 5th birthday was coming up I decided to order a custom cake from Apron
I spoke to the head chef, Anjani Rawat, who was willing to customise both the flavour and the design to match what my daughter would love.

I was very impressed with the professionalism of Anjani both before and after the cake arrived. The cake was not only enjoyed my daughter, who picked off all the pink butter cream icing but the entire family as well. To my surprise we learnt that all the cakes are eggless and gelatine free.

Since then we have ordered cakes from her multiple times and every time the design and taste impresses all those around.

Amazing work."
Thank you apron patisserie for the phenomenal chocolate and mint cake. The cake as delicious as it was beautiful. It was one of the best cakes I have had.
"Amazing amazing amazing! Customisation is the key of Apron and the flavors are real, not too sweet, one can taste the quality quite literally. I had a variety of cupcakes, from the buttercream to the soft and moist cake, its hard to find international standard desserts and this one is just that!"
"I wanted to order a cake for my wife on her birthday. Wanted to get something different, something that wasnâ€™t available in the common cake shops.. Apron patisserie provided me just that.. It was a mint chocolate cake and right from the first bite youâ€™d know that the cake was made with love! Thank you for making my wifeâ€™s day special!"
"Ate a variety of cupcakes - too many different types to remember names... but they included a phenomenal coffee ganache and lightest, loveliest frosting you could ask for. Ate some sensational chocolate cake too. They make great recommendations if you're not sure what you want. You can talk to the owner/chef to come up with a unique culinary creation for special occasions based on your own tastes and preferences - very cool! 

Will definitely try again at every chance."
"Placed an order for a customised birthday cake..... The cake was delivered timely and conveniently...

Customisation was perfectly executed. Exactly as per the design and photos exchanged. They went out of their way to agree to a not-so-common chocolate-orange flavour that several other bakeries had no clue about.

Very happy with everything.

I've paid a lot more for not nearly as good cakes.. Team Apron to expect a lot of repeat and referral business from me...."
Ordered from here for the first time. The blueberry cheese cake was extremely delectable . It's a treat to your taste buds. Looking forward to order from here again. Highly Recommended.
They have a wide variety of deserts and savouries. The ones I settled in for my daughter were their macaroons like cream pastries. Those tasted amazing and my baby loved it. How I wish they had a branch near Powai too
Tried this bakery for the first time...but unfortunately was disappointed...I was expecting a cake with a picture of my son and hubby by it turned out too ordinary..also the taste was nothing special...ordered chocolate gooey cake and it was like any ordinary Monginis chocolate cake...sorry but was really looking forward for some surprise but was shocked in spite of so many good reviews .
Wow! Simply awesome! Finger lickin' good!! I loved the cakes and pasteries of Apron Patisserie.. They are not just tasty but look good too.. A feast for my eyes and my taste buds
"Simply fantastic! People say that we eat with our eyes first and Apron does a very impressive part to offer creative ideas and the execution is flawless! If you got your own design in mind they accommodate most requests as well ! (Great for corporate lunch/dinners)

So once you're done feasting your eyes on the creation, reluctantly you'll have to cut into it. I assure you that it's worth it because after every bite, you just want more and more.

One of the key takeaways for me is that I can customise the designs and the flavour or just leave it up to the Apron team to help you decide!"
"Apron has the most beautifully decorated cakes. Lovely stuff , reasonably priced. Home delivery service. She takes care of use of proper colours in the cakes especially from children's point of view. Recommended surely."
"Delicious stuff, have tried most of the stuff and it's all amazing... Good taste & Quality :) totally recommend this for anyone who wants to order cakes cupcakes etc..."
Apron patisserie cakes and desserts are amazing .for each occasion she has a beautiful cake to offer.The colour combinations and the designs are amazing too and not to forget they are very tasty.
Apron Patisserie's cakes are scrumptious.....Anjani Kasliwal uses unusual combinations and is very innovative.. Her cakes n deserts are a visual delight too. I tried out the  Rose and Pistachio Tea cake and it was superb  as were her fudgy fudge brownies and Red Velvet Cake . Normally I am not a fan of chocolate mousse  but Apron Patisserie's chocolate mousse was great . So light  and not too sweet ..loved it. Her packaging is classy and what i really love is the personalized  and individual attention she gives you.  So happy that South Mumbai has a place like Apron Patisserie.. Hopefully will be trying out every single thing on the menu..:) :)  :)
"Obnoxious.
I ordered a customised pineapple cake and half an hour before the scheduled delivery I was told that fresh pineapples couldn't be found so l agreed for a chocolate cake with coffee. The coffee flavour was missing. The bread smelt like baking soda. It was dense and tasteless. It..."
"Ordered a customised 1/2 kg cake , at first glance the presentation of the cake was magnificent ( a real thumbs up for that ) but the taste of the cake was a total disaster
I wouldn't recommend after my personal experience ."
"When I first placed an order for a box of assorted cupcakes, I had many questions in my mind. But when I took the first bite, my inhibitions flew away! She loves making cakes in unusual flavours and specializes in Eggless & Gelatin free baking. The client can call and tell exactly what he/she feels like eating and its will be made. I tried Rose + Pistachio, Vanilla Hazelnut, Red velvet, chocolate fudge"
Beautiful and well designed celebratory cakes. Most unique flavours customised to your tastes and preferences. Must have- waffle flavoured cupcakes!
"There was a need for a cake and there came AP to our rescue... A fantastic Red Velvet with White Choc Ganache. Taste, decor and value 10/10!!! For sure!!!
Also had a chance to try brownies which were delicious. So much more to write about them, but I feel it better to keep silent and let the cakes do the talking. Keep it up!"
"Their cupcakes are bite sized and delicious! Caramel and red velvet were among my favorites. Brownies are gooey and soft: esp. the Nutella one. Icing on the cake: everything is egg less!
If you are looking for a new dessert place Apron is where you should be going!"

I ordered a big quantity of cakes for give aways to guests in a party. Everyone really appreciated it. They were so fresh and they lasted also long. The cream used was soo freshly made that enhanced the flavour all the more.. Would surely reccomend.
"Ordered a cake for my daughter's birthday. Was made perfectly and looked very pretty with a bow on top. The taste was exquisite, neither too dry nor too creamy.. And just the perfect level of softness.. Was well appreciated by both adults and children."
"I got my wedding cake done from apron patisserie... And I was amazed with the fondant it was just apt.. I hate fondant cakes but this one was just too good... It was perfect not too sweet nor it was very hard... The first tire was salted caramel and second tier was chocolate fudge... Both the flavours were yummy... The cake got over with few minutes... The presentation was very neat and it just looked brilliant

Much love"
"We ordered two cakes from here..must say it turned out to be much better than we expected, both with the taste and the appearance. A must try. Very friendly and cooperative. Thank u"
"The cake is eggLess. Looks awesome, taste's even better and in terms of ingredients, simply Superb. I have several friends who are Jains and Apron Patisserie cakes have suited them best. They appreciate, the taste, quality and overall love and affection which is clearly visible when you see the cake in front of you"
"They really have Brilliant presentation. Tastewise the cakes are Delectable, delicious and delightful cakes. Cant wait to try all their options !!"
Delicious cakes....love the presentation.....a must try!!!!
Attention to detail and a variety of deserts and cakes to satisfy all kinds of taste-buds. Top Notch! Must try the blueberry and lemon cupcakes.
"I have been an ardent fan of Apron for a while now. Being someone without much of a sweet tooth it is extremely difficult to entice me with deserts. However, I can clearly say that the deserts from Apron make even my mouth water. The attention to detail in the cakes cannot be matched. I have been witness to many a cake with absolutely perfect shapes including a cappuccino cup. I have never seen or heard of a cake in the shape of a cappuccino cup before. No matter what you order and however high your expectations are Apron will definitely exceed your expectations. Kudos to Apron!!!"
The cake looks awesome and tastes even better. Apron patisserie makes an occasion very very special.
My husband ordered my birthday cake from Apron. The picture crafted on it was beautifully done and the cake was so yummy which made my day. Since then I recommend Apron for all big and small occasions... Apron rocks ????

"Excellent

cake for an occasion and was very happy with the cake I received."
"Heard abt the place from a friend. Ordered a customised cake for my girlfriends bday and she dint wanna share the cake with anyone, I was lucky she let me have a piece. Absolutely brilliant. The detail and the creation of the cake showed the passion and care the baker has for her profession. Tried the cupcakes after and they were absolutely divine too.
Look forward to trying the other items soon.
Thank u Apron Patisserie for exceeding my expectations and providing for a wonderful cake for my Mrs.
