"Good place to have different varieties of dosa. Even the price is okay. There is seating available sometimes, just near the place as there are chairs kept. Otherwise you may have to stand while eating."
"I love the range of options available at this place. As a fan of fusion food, I have enjpyed most of the dosas that I have had here."
Best dosa place ever. I absolutely relish this place. All dosa varieties are yummy coz of their special masala. I usually have jini dosa but recently tried paneer chilli dosa which was also fab. A must visit place in Matunga especially for a late night snack.

"The dosa tastes good, just how you'd expect but why is it expensive? I had the Open Dosa which is basically cheese masala dosa but open. Its one of their special & expensive dosas. Just because its open doesn't justify its price for me, should not cost more than 100rs"

"There's something wrong with their dosa. The batter quality is different or it's not the same. Tastes not at all like a dosa, more like a mashed Frankie something. Overpriced and not tasty. Also no Sambhar?"
"I was very excited to try this place, since have heard good things about it, But alas, The menu is quite diversified, but food was not up to the mark, The ingredients and batter didn't seems to be fresh.. which reflected on the overall taste of dosa, coconut chutney was bland, Red garlic chutney was good. Service is good, they keep stool just outside the shop, There were no hand sanitizer at table or billing counter. Price wise it is overpriced. and not worth it. I had ordered khakra dosa and Paneer mysore masala dosa. both dosa were average. and had to eat them just for the sake of finishing it. If they can use fresh ingredients it would definitely show a difference in taste."
"This new dosa parlour in Matunga has killed it with the dosa innovations from pasta dosa to pav bhaji dosa, manchurian dosa and chocolate dosa they would amaze you with any combo you choose with your dosa!"
"Bored of the basic butter or masala dosa? Then try out this lip smacking Schezwan Manchurian Dosa (a south indian recipe with chinese combination) @mawalibhaidosa which serves the tastiest dosas that I have ever had.

This delectable fusion dosa will surely leave you craving for more.❤️"
"We had the cheese schezwan dosa
It was ok
Cheese filling was generous
They didn’t give sambhar which was a bit disappointing
Overall a good place to eat
But they have serious competition as Matunga is all about South Indian cuisine"
"If you want to eat jini dosa, this is one of the best place to eat jini dosa. Other must try is pizza dosa."
"Good Taste but too many drawbacks.
No sitting place 👎🏻
Expensive than Competitors 👎🏻
No Promotions seen 👎🏻
No Offers 👎🏻
No Discounts 👎🏻
They really need to look after other factors other than taste .. otherwise they will face losses instead of good taste . I know they can get more customers if they look into the problems and improve. ❣📸

"As it was Saturday evening,so I visited Matunga circle ⭕ to have Dosa. Since from last 3 years I am visiting this outlet on weekends

Today I took parcel of Machurian Pasta Dosa
👎 I didn't found the taste good.. As they give just only 2 small Machurian balls which was totally Raw, it was really very dispoiting. Even the pasta was too much spicy 🔥 that with every bite I was sipping water .
The dosa was medium quantity but so veggies inside the dosa...

Cons - taste to be improved atleast of this Machurian pasta dosa..rest their other dosa are very good..

Settings place to be arranged and on the top roof should be there. as always we stand outside and have the snacks

"Mawali bhai dosa is one of the most famous street food places in Matunga and is a must visit if you are there in and around king circle as it is cheaper than the other hotels and cafe's available. The service is very quick and the dosa's made are extremely yummy ,the chutnies provided are very nice . So if you visit Matunga you need to have a look at this place"
"I tried so many food items here jini dosa,manchurian dosa,pasta dosa, chilly dosa etc. presentation was good seating arrangement was also good but in all the food items taste was same there is nothing different in the food that can be better if they improve..."
Paneer Manchurian Dosa was yummy by itself. No need of other things.
"No hygiene is maintained. They do not wear hair cap or gloves while cooking. The cook was touching his hair.. nose and cooking. That's so disgusting.
And talking about the quality of dosa.. they are giving rubber dosa. Dosa is something which easily breaks.

Please for the safety of your own. Do not visit this place."

"South Indian cuisine with North Indian taste.
You can't get a authentic taste of South Indian dishes. It doesn't serve 'Sambhar' with dosa. Insane"
"I’ve had so many dosas in my life, but this one crazy dosa I had at this place will always be the most unforgettable dosa of my life.
It was spicy, cheesy and extremely delicious.
We tried jini dosa and manchurian dosa and OH MY GOD!!!

"I don't know why but I love eating dosa, can eat about 5-6 dosas at a time. Mawali bhai dosa is a dosa joint at Maheshwari Udyan, Matunga. They have variety of options to choose from.

What I ate:
1. Paneer cheese chutney dosa:
Dosa stuffed with veggies, masalas, paneer, and chutney topped with lots of cheese, coriander and spring onion greens. Served with white, green and red chutney.
2. Cheese burst dosa:
Dosa stuffed with mashed potatoes, onions and spices. Topped with lots of cheese and mayonnaise.
At the same time it is crispy soft and buttery. .

I just loved the red chutney.

Over all its a nice place and a pocket friendly one right in the hub of matunga.
Must try would be 

Pasta dosa 

Chinese dosa 

Chocolate dosa . 

spring roll dosa "
"loved the fusion dosas, unique concept amazng taste great delivery, I like exploring new food and was very skeptical about their fusion cause never had seen such experimentation with food, but it was worth it. 100% recommended"
"Mawali Bhai Dosa
Another up and coming place for Dosa lovers in Matunga is the Mawali Bhai Dosa.

They make some of the most brilliant dosas with unique fillings and toppings.

We ordered:
1 Spring Roll Dosa
1 Maggi Cheese Dosa
1 Pasta dosa with Red Sauce.
1 Cheese Fries

The way they make this is too much fun to watch. A true Dosa Art! :)

Very Affordable, Very Clean, Very Tasty.

Please note: Either you can stand and eat or they could arrange a small table and chairs for you on the streets.

I tried their masala dosa . It has a very unique and different taste it is bit on the spicy side also the masala used to make this dosa very different from the one which we see normally. Overall great experience.
"Visit Day Date and Time: Friday 6th September, 2019, 19.00 p.m.

""Mawali Bhai Dosa"" a compact outlet which is located at Matunga Circle. This place was on my list since quite sometime now and finally visited it.

We tried out following:-
1. Mysore Sada Dosa;- Its nice and cripsy. Just perfect as needed
2. Manchurian Dosa:- This dosa comes with alot of filling. You cant finish it with one dosa. Trust me, you would surely order one sada dosa with it. Overall tasty and my personal favourite.

Point to Note:- No seating option, If you park your car they serve you inside your car too. 

Experience:- Overall superb experience and im planing to visit this place again as still alot on the menu...read more"
"I heard so much about Mysore Masala Dosa so I want to try it. Ordered it. It was huge and super tasty.
Dosa served with sambhar full of veggies and taste epic also coconut chutney is my favorite. 
I will definitely be back to this place."
Easy to locate on Matunga circle ..variety of dosa..dosas are tasty but u have to enjoy that in open space area..Dil khush dosa and Mysore masala dosa must be tried
Just order masala dosa. Waste of money.. Dosa is completely tasteless. No sambar. All 3 dosas in burnt state. Overfried. Yuk. Never recommend.
"I have tried Mysore Masala Dosa, Paneer Chilly Dosa, Chilly Cheese Dosa, Paneer Manchrurian Dosa, Pasta Dosa and many others. It brilliant. Its delicious. It is very filling. It fills you like a 3-course meal. Very cost-effective. A must visit. This is one of my favourite places in mumbai."
"This place serves one of the best dosa I ever tasted . Located at a prime location in Matunga, it attracts a lot of on goers . I have tasted most of the dosas here but my fav has to be Manchurian Pasta Dosa .
Omg ! The combination is heavenly. It’s a perfect taste of Manchurian and pasta . It has a bit of tangy taste which adds more flavour to this dish. The dosa was quite crisp as it should be and had a lot of butter on it .It is served with three types of chutney which tastes yummy too. Definitely a must try dish here ."
"An answer by every dosa vendor in Mumbai for pizza - Jini Dosa.

This Jini Dosa at Mawali Bhai Dosa is an absolute treat to have.

Dosas cooked in butter and topped with a spicy mixture of vegetables, the need of the hour for every hungry head out there is this.

And yes, they heavily garnish the dosa with cheese to make it a complete snack.

They also provide you with 3 types of chutneys, which really adds to the dosa's essence.

So grab hold of a friend of yours who owes you a treat and head towards this place."
"Visited last week
Heard lot of this place in matunga.
We ordered
●-Open dosa
It was good in taste.
Prices r bit high for every dosa
Overall experience was good"
I ordered tandoori cheese fries & they're so poor in taste & quality of the fries was so bad that I literally puked out 🤢🤮. Please eat tandoori fries on your own risk 😶💩.
This place has best dosa ... The don’t have proper seatings available . This outlet Shares with Vj cafe .. the place is not clean .. There were insects.. may be it was rain season but .the Dosa was tasty the price of Dosa are expensive.
"Not a great place. Hygiene is questionable.

Ordered nachos and what I got was cornitos with a lot of mayo and grated cheese.

When they say nachos, it is assumed, you need melted cheese over it.

I asked for bill after payment but was not given any.

Certainly wouldn't recommend this place."
"Horrible taste. I don't know how this place got to be so popular. I ordered 4 items and all of them looked and tasted the same, full of chillies and salt. Had to discard half of the order."
"The only one thing u vl say after eating at this place VOWWW....Simply awesome located right at prime place in matunga near 5 garden and all time crowded place, trying its Paneer chilly dosa, Jini dosa or Manchurian dosa or cheese chilly dosa all r premium ones....N at reasonable cost u tend to get the best quality, the hygiene, fast service and sumptuous food...What else we require...Must visit this paisa vasool place"
"I love the Dora's here pretty much affordable and tasty! We tried the masala dosa and definitely loved all the three chutney the filling inside was cooked very well and was mashed to perfection, definitely worth a try. Would suggest you guys to visit here."
"Ordered Cheese sada dosa.
The dosa was overloaded with cheese, and their red chutney was lit.
probably one of the best dosa i had in recent times.

The only part which i dont like, is that they dont have a seating arrangement.

"Area near Matunga station is a hub for south Indian food. This time I ordered from Mawalibhai Dosa and it was a little disappointing. Packing waa not proper and thus food waa leaked out of box which spoiled even dosa.
I ordered following delicacies:

#Paneer Chilli Dosa and #Paneer Mysore Masala Dosa: Taste of both gravy were nice. Even quantity was great. Just dosa was not proper due to packaging."
"In the picture -
Paneer chilly dosa
I think it's one of the best dish in their entire menu. The batter is well prepared, fresh and the dosa was soft with good crisp. Paneer chilly with perfect flavour and well chopped paneer cubes. Plus it's served with green chutney, coconut chutney and Schezwan as well. In short, the best paneer chilly dosa I had till date.
P. S. - I enjoy the fact that it's prepared in front of your eyes. Makes it even more tempting.
Try out their other variants as well."
I think this place serves a huge variety of dosa's more than anyone in matunga area..its is clean and hygenice place to eat..they do have a little costly dosa's as compared to other outlets..the staff is very friendly..the one which i ordered was cheeze chilli dosa which had an okayish type of taste..i expected a lot more cheezier dosa then what they serve ..but taste wise it was a good dosa..althought pasta dosa served here is very delicious..i would totally recommend this place
"Visited this place recently. Its a road side stall, good place if you want to try unique variety of dosas. Tried their Masala dosa and cheese chutney powder dosa. Dosas are good in taste, just that they need some improvement in maintaining cleanliness. It was not hygienic i feel."
"I visit this place with my family and they also like this place. This place is situated in matunga east. They serves amazing variety of dosas and different kind of flavours. I like the outdoor sitting vibe. All are people is living in near matunga they can also visit this place or other places on weekends.

We tried sada dosa, mysore masala dosa, kerla masala dosa and paneer chilly dosa. All are the dosas perfectly cooked and very crispy. Especially i like the kerla masala dosa, this dosa was blended with different kind of kerla spices.

At the end i recommend to others please visit this place and spend time with your loving friends and family."
"Typical South Indian food provided at this outlet in Matunga. Had Mysore Sada Soda, the stuffing was nice. The taste was awesome.!!

Shoutout for all the South-Indian food lovers, you must visit this place!!"
The mysore sada dosa from mawali Bhai is really very tasty as compared it's price and also really a good breakfast to have and begin our day with so try it and definitely you will love it

"A quick eat in Matunga East. This small eatery has a variety of dosa combinations ranging from Indian to Chinese styles. Whether it be the paneer manchurian or the mysore cheese dosa, they have a lot of choices. There is however, no place to sit so be prepared to wait for a small chair to get empty outside the eatery or stand if you're in a hurry. The dosa itself was really taste and good flavors."
"Dam good taste.. n worth for money quality quantity.. must try schewan choupsey dosa, pizza dosa, paneer variety dosa , n fries too n soft drinks."
"Enjoyed here different dosa's which consist of Manchurian Dosa and Panner Schezwan Dosa this both were amazing delicious cooked dosa's and service was so fast within 2-4 minutes we got our dosa at the end we had ordered Panner Chilly Dosa which to was good was perfectly cooked
Only the problem was the Coconut Chutney was sour and tasted bad because it was kept next to Dosa pan which changes the taste of dosa to sour
Visited this place 5 days ago"
"Great dosas. Being decorated very well and tastes great. Proper South Indian feel. Loved the chutneys here. Like the mawali Bhai special, must try once. Great outlet, and it costs reasonably fair. Recommend for South Indian lovers👍"

"Today we were in the mood to eat something light, so we decided to head to “Mawali Bhai Dosa” at Matunga. They have some unique combinations when it comes to dosas. We tried the “Mysore Masala Cheese Dosa” and “Chocolate Dosa”. The dosa was nice and crisp, the masala and cheese were both proportionate not over powering the other. The chocolate dosa was a good twist to the regular dosa. A must try joint for their dosa variants!"
