"Amazing food served by this outlet. Perfect placed for quick bites. So decided to order it from here.
Ordered chickoo milkshake which was delivered chill and nicely packed without any leakings. Also ordered the tawa pulav it tasted perfect. Loved the quantity. I keep ordering food from here they never disappoint me."
Naan and kadhai paneer was ordered by me and it was too good. Ambience was good . Foid was too tasty. Hygience level was maintained and the staff was very polite.
"Aditi fast food is located at parleshwar road,vile parle east. They serves north Indian, south Indian, street food and juices."
Zomato rider not wearing uniform and was very rude in talking didn‚Äôt had the courtesy to stop and talk
"As they always branded it.. they did stand on the name and it was delicious and fulfilling as ever! üòç
Sunday is always a food day and you better not skip it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
Pav Bhaji at Aditi Fast Food, Andheri West @ 105/- only ü§§ü§§ü§§ (AC rates differ)
A quantity that'll suffice all your hunger and just fills up your taste buds and tummy üòÆ
The proper Bombay Pav Bhaji with goodness of masala and butter üî•"
"If you're looking for quick vegetarian food, this is the perfect place. Plenty of seating nooks for large groups at this cheerful, bright, tubelight-lit, air-conditioned restaurant. Located at Andheri West near station, this vegetarian haven is the sister concern of the famed Amar Juice Centre."
"This place is very pocket friendly and serve best manchurian dry and sandwiches ,the prices are affordable with good quality along with quantity, i love the way they serve us with a smile on their face."
"The staff here is rude and if asked to explain something, they‚Äôll show unnecessary attitude and won‚Äôt give you a proper explanation. We ordered regular water and the glass was stinking. We ordered one Mysore Masala and one Chilli Milli Dosa. The former Dosa was so empty and with little fillings. It was like a Masala Dosa. Really not happy with the place and the service. Food is very okayish."
"Must visit this small place nearby station. It very easy to catch up for gupshup at this place. I have been visiting this place regularly as it's less noisy, hygienic, quiet and paisa vasool.

Ordered following items:

Finger chips: Crispy, crunchy and salted fries served with sauce.

Rava sada dosa: I love this dosa from here. Very big and crunchy dosa coz of Rava served with hot sambhar and chutney.

Staff is courteous and quick service.

Final analysis:

Food: (5/5)
Taste: (5/5)
Ambience: (3/5)
Value for üí∞: (5/5)
Hygiene: (5/5)"
"Good place for quick bites..
Small seating area
They have various food options from startes to Chinese main course
Milk shakes are good thick but very cold
Oliy food if you are going for Chinese dishes
But overall good for choti choti bhuk!!
They have biryanis as well
Food - 4/5
Hygine - 3.5/5
Staff - 3.5/5
Just opposite to Andheri Railway station"
Worst food and service of this restaurant.
Adiliti fast food is a sister concern of Amar Juice and centre. It is at a very convenient place and is situated right opposite Andheri Station. But unlike Amar it doesn't quite appeal my taste buds. The place is quite small and sometimes they mess up the food quality wise. But it's an affordable option and at a very convenient place.
"I was really tired after travelling so much and was super hungry and the only thing that caught my eyes was Aditi..
I ordered cheese pav bhaji and it was really tasty
Best part about it is ,it is situated near andheri station so whenever tired and hungry after travelling or before travelling it is the best option.."
"It's not a lavish restaurant, but compared to the area it's located, it's good. It's opposite andheri station. Easily visible. It's on the first floor.
Coming to food, it's good. Tasty and reasonable.
One thing that I didn't like was that, they don't customize the food as per your taste.
And they don't have all the usual items, which is a little disappointing.
We tried sandwich and pav bhaji, which was nice.
I really liked the way they decorated the ü•™"

"This pace is right outside Andheri Station.
Standard food if you have a quick meeting or something this place is great & suitable .
Quality is decent according to what the charge.
I have almost eaten everything from the their menu.
They are famous for South Indian & Pav bhaji.
The place is not a high end place so hygiene is not taken care of but manageable."
"Outlet
Located at 1st floor
Good infrastructure
Very near to andheri railway station

Food
Food was delicious
Available at reasonable prices
Tasty was also good
Specifically I like cheese sandwich and many other things were also good.

Service
Staff was also cooperative
Service was not so good

"Service- 3/5
Food Quality- 4/ 5
Ambience- 3/5

This is more of ""munch on the go"" restaurant rather than ""dine-in"". This place serves mainly healthy South Indian food and juices. It's also known for authentic Frankies and Sandwiches. With its remarkable location, the place is located just outside Andheri West station. This is a place which can add up the good calories. Hygiene and other aspects are well-considered here.
PS: Jain food and fast service provided here."
Aditi Fast Food is one of my favorite pure vegetarian family restaurant. Here I visit so many time's with my family and here we just love everything and especially their Chilli Paneer is just amazing.
"Dinner takeaway from Aditi Restaurant in Andheri West for 4 of us was :-
3 idlis, 1 veg pizza, 1 chilli cheese toast,
1 medium pav Bhajji & 1 watermelon juice.

This Aditi restaurant is located very close to the station so it‚Äôs usually packed.
I‚Äôve eaten at a couple of their other outlets but it was a first for the andheri outlet for me. I had my watermelon juice while I waited for my order to get ready which took approx 15-20 mins as the veg pizza & chilli cheese toast takes time to prepare. The Aroma of their pav Bhajji , cheese pizza will make you hungry instantly üòÇ

Aditi restaurants offer quick fast food at affordable prices & dont emphasis a lot on the interiors. The...read more"
"Ordered Idli vada from adii , packaging was good sambhar and chutney needs improvement , sambhar was sweet and sour , chutney needs little bit of spicyness and thickness , vada and Idli were cooked perfectly"
"Good service , less quantity compared to others , pretty good taste . Pav bhaji is a must have dish from this restaurant . Cost is better than other restaurants."
"It is an pocket friendly outlet as this outlet is located in andheri near railway station. It serves only veg food. And it has good ambience , and the staffs are friendly too. I had visited here and had a pav bhaji with mine friends. Must visit here it is an casual dinning outlet."
"We took all toppings pizza for 140 ‚Çπ and schezwan paneer dosa for 100 ‚Çπ taste was good . It is a fast food cafe and prize is also affordable for a person . should try it
""Keep eating ...lots of love"""
"A good place to have some quick snacks .
Food is absolutely perfect in taste and is Served in proper time .
Outlet has a good ambience .
Will visit again"
Just an ordinary fast food restaurant. Nothing great. But not bad also. Good place to have some light snacks while in nearby area. Food taste is okay.
"One of the best place to munch fast food when you are travelling and hungry near Andheri Station. Its above Andheri Bus Depot, a pure veg restaurant where you can get south Indian, Chinese, Roti-Sabji and juices. The prices are pocket friendly with quantity double the worth.
I ordered paneer chilly, Shanghai rice, paneer manchurian, sweet corn soup and mango milkshake. All of the items were yummm and quantity full.
Paper Dosa they serve is of 25 inches ... must try it!

The reason I gave one star less is the lack of washroom and some odd things.
But worth the meal!"
"It's a request to not order from this place.
Their food quality is pathetic.
I ordered 5 different things and everything had a bad taste.
Please do not order."
"Situated just outside andheri station this place is a great option to visit if you are a vegetarian . They serve a variety of dishes starting from pav bhaji , dosa, chinese etc. The service is decent and so is the food. The food here is not bad enough to disappoint you but it is not average either. Its more like above average.  I personally tried mysore masala dosa and i must say they made it quite well. To get the balance of the masalas right in this dosa is really hard. The price also seemed to be justified. The ambience is quite nice since this restaurant is on the first floor and if you get bored you can  just look through the glass. Also , I loved the pun on their menu .

"I visited this place on a day where i was travelling a lot and i was super hungry. To be honest i wasn't expecting much from this place but it turned out to be an amazing time. I ordered south indian dishes after a long time. The service time was fast and the ambience is mediocre not something special to talk about.

Dishes we ordered:
1)Masala Dosa
Same as a regular masala dosa which was well made and perfect for my liking

2)Onion uttapa
Well cooked and as the sambar and chutney were good the combo became even better.

3)Tomato uttapa
Well made and as the sambar and chutney were good the combo became even better.
4)Triple Schezwan fried rice
Regular chinese well made no regrets on this...read more"
"Place is situated near Andheri West station.The food which we ordered were Mysore Masala Dosa, Veg Hakka noodles,Veg Schezwan noodles,Uthappa and cheese sandwich. Quality of the food is good as well as the ambience was beautiful."
"This is a decent place located outside the Andheri Railway Station. The place is bit small but air conditioned. The food here is just average. The most disappointing part of the place was that the quantity to price ratio was very low. Some of the food items didn't feel worth the money.
We had the :

Veg. Grill Cheese Sandwich - 2.5/5
Mysore Masala Dosa - 3/5
Veg. Hakka Noodles -3/5
Schezwan Noodles - 3.5/5

The waiters were a bit moody and would answer to you after some time. Overall the place is average."

"Good in terms of snaks items and south indian dishes. Food served is fresh and of good quality.
It a to go joint if you looking for a quick bite.

Food ordered:
Grilled sandwich
Butter dosa
Rawa idli"
I have gone here so many times and always loved this place but unfortunately my last visit here was not that good. i ordered 1 paneer masala dosa and it was not at all tasty.
Provides with all kind of fast food and fresh juices . Really love the food they provide my personal favorite is pav bhaji and pizza . Also try falooda worth a try .
Pathetic.This is regarding 2 masala dosas ordered by me. There were wooden straws in the dosas & also in 1 dosa there was no masala.The chutney was tasteless.This is playing with customers health.
"Worst Pav Bhaji in town
Never ever ever ever Visit this place for Pav Bhaji

Rest items can be Okay, Good or Fine, but a STRICT No No for Pav Bhaji, there r Way way better places to have good MUMBAI Pav Bhaji in Bombay"
we ordered food from here. i received the food after fifty minutes and the packing of the food was just ok. overall experience was not good. I am rating this restaurant as two star and my overall experience was nor not satisfied.
maysor dose and masala dose was same I hate this and no taste
This place is a typical fast food place because you really get your food fast. No fancy ambience at all simple udpi restaurant but you get everything from south Indian to Chinese. Aditi Special Pav Bhaji is definitely a must try.And this place has the best sambar. Do try these two things.
Such pathetic way of packing food. The dosa was stuck to the packing paper and was in edible. On top of it the when i called aditi juice centre the person was rude and non cooperative. They dint resend my order nor did they reimburse me. Kindly avoid ordering from here. What a waste of money!
For me more than the Food what matters is the service which is pathetic here. The person who sits at the billing counter is very rude. Food is average & not hygienic. The plates in which food is served is not all clean.  Even if you tell the staff about the tables not being clean they'll act like they're doing a favour by cleaning it. I could go on & on with the bad points.
"All I have heard about the restaurant was exactly awesome as heard, the service was excellent and the food was worth and cheap ,paying the cost was worth the price,do visit ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Best place to have frankie! This place serves variety of juices and milkshakes and also other food beverages like burgers, sandwich, Pizza and south indian food.
It's more of a pick up food joint as there is no place to stand nearby and bit crowded. The taste is great and value for money."
"Fine if you want to order anything south Indian. But pathetic paneer starters,  flavourless & tasteless with massive coatings of flour. very dissapointed."
Horrible food. I had ordered 2 Masala dosas from this place and they were horrible. The patoto masala was stale and tasted sour. Even the chutney spread out on the dosa was sour and spicy. The coconut chutney was watery. Had to through off the entire order. Not worth ordering from this place. Highly avoidable
"Me n my friend visitied today.We ordered paav bhaaji the bhaaji was so bad and tasteless...when we complain they were not ready to accept the order........
Very bad experience"
"Aditi fast food makes all kinds of food. Spacial in Chinese food. I have tasted there paav bhaji, and veg shegwan frid rice. They provide food with reasonable price and good quality"
"ADITI FAST
A SMALL JOINT LOCATED NEAR ANDHERI WEST STATION
THE TASTE OF FOOD IS GREAT
THE HYGIENE THAT THE MAINTAIN IS GREAT
IT HAS A VARIETY OF SNACKS AND PIZZAS,ETC
WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE"
worst food ever... please don't order anytime from this place... the taste of the food was pathetic... just spoiled the mood and I had order the food from other place... worst ever.. totally disappointed
"Visited lot many times ambiance is decent. They will serve you hygienic and quantity of food. Must try cheese tava pullao. They have full menu of north indian, south indian, chinese"
What a waste.Heard a lot about the place but it was üôÑChinese was still average but the Indian food was pathetic.Just try and ask for anything extra and you will just see the crying faces of the staff.
"This was my second visit to this place and I believe last
On my first visit I shared a falooda with a friend and was at the restaurant for around 30mins and had a good perception about the place

So I recommended it to my friends and it was a wrong decision
Ambience was okayish, a good place to meet people as it‚Äôs just outside Andheri West station

Staff and service was quick (the only two reasons I gave two star)
We ordered VEG CRISPY and it was awful. Somehow we managed to finish it (we were three)
I understand being a normal restaurant you won‚Äôt have such chef‚Äôs who can prepare these kind of foods properly, but then why to have such dishes in the menu ?"
"Aditi is one of the best fast food restaurants of Mumbai. Scores high in terms of quality and taste. All their items from pav bhaji to dosa to frankie are worth trying out. Location just outside Andheri station is an added benefit. On the negative side, with passing time they have overpriced the menu which has resulted in less people visiting the place. Sadly, Aditi now has lost its popularity and vast customer base which it was once known for in the city."
"#sounthindianlover just perfect place for South Indian food lover, quick service and pocket friendly, delicious and tasty food good to go with family!"

Service is fast 4/5

A nice place to chill with your friends when your around Andheri station has its just opposite of it. The ambience isn't amazing and you don't even expect that to be honest. The food is quite good and quite reasonably priced. Overall I had a good experience for this place. Will visit again pretty soon.
"This place is bang opposite Andheri Station. A fast food joint you would want to opt for breakfast or light food.
There is a juice centre and a sandwich counter on the ground floor and AC Resto on the first floor.

It does not have a great ambiance to boast of as such.

The food is very reasonable. You can have a quick bite here. Things you should try - dosas, idli, sandwiches.

Service is quick. In a alltime rush at Andheri station, you can stop at this joint for a quick bite.

Food - 3.5/5
Service - 3/5
Ambiance - 3/5
Price - 4/5

Overall rating - 3/5"
The Singapore fried rice is a must try!! It's a great place for friends who want to eat good food at a reasonable amount. I must say I love hanging out here.
"This place is just opposite the railway station on top of the bus depot. Quick service. Food is good. Ambience is average. All in all, best place to have quick fast food near Andheri station."
"As the name states, the food is served quickly which is a plus point. Pav bhaji is a must try as it‚Äôs really good. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you to try Chinese cuz the taste is terrible."
"Aditi Fast food is located near Andheri Station and is always filled with students coming here to have some cheap food.
My personal favorite are Cheese hot dog and garlic roll. The garlic roll in particular is way too delicious. The Malai Kulfi is so amazing that you'll end up ordering it multiple times."
"As the name suggests, its purely a fast food joint.
I have never been inside the place but have taken parcel couple of times...

Food is quite good."
"Used to frequent this place with friends after our classes were finished and have fond memories of this place. The entry to this restaurant is bit confusing as one has to keep an eye leading upstairs. Located right opposite Andheri station, and being pocket friendly, it used to be suitable option for us to have some quick bites or fast food from this place. The food though was decent , we used to have a good time over food before boarding train to our home."
