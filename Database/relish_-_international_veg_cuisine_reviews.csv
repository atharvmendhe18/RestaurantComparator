The space feels too noisy because of tables very close by to each other otherwise the food is amazing. The sizzlers are a must try.
"This resturant is ever green when its comes to taste of the food! Since past 10 yrs its the same! You can try panner sashlik sizzer, pasta , nachos, foundue.."
Lovely food as always for ppl who love Indian version of continental. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Truly disappointed. I have been a frequent visitor with friends and family but today's experience was very disappointing. Let it be the attitude of staff or the sizzler that was served, both were sub standard. Maybe it is the success curve that has made them compromise on their values."
"American hash burn, chili cheese & garlic bread also burn can eat it is very hard. We are senior citizen so all bread is waste for us. So plse be careful for this matter. Thanks"

"We ordered cheese garlic bread , monchow soup and pink sauce pasta and cheese nachos.
Ambience is lovely for a family dinner.
But the food quality and taste has drastically gone down.
The salsa sauce was so watery and bad in taste.
Garlic bread had no garlic but the pink sauce pasta as we all know is not so strong in garlic was absolutely strong as if it was aglio olio.
Really disappointed with the food."

"Was seated in the banquet, it had a stink and suffocation"

"nice food and delicious food
good quality food with ingredients
eco-friendly package"
"I didn‚Äôt enjoy the cheese nachos or onion rings. The nachos were of a weird quality but the paneer platter is amazing and that alone makes me give this place a 3. If you‚Äôre going to Relish, please have the paneer platter."

Pizza is not cooked from reverse side and I want refund the pizza is not good at all
"I specifically customised it to be Jain, And all it had was garlic and gravy. It‚Äôs like every couple months I order from Zomato I get so disappointed and motivated enough to not order again"

There was a stone in rice big stone

In pasta you give more sauces it‚Äôs taste is nice. I think in American hash need some paper‚Äôs.

"The ambience was subtle. When we entered the restaurant it was too noisy.
The service was quick even when the restaurant was jammed.
We ordered Special Jain Platter and it was below average nothing great or new.
Secondly we ordered Veg Manchow soup and it was good..
Lastly we ordered Enchiladas and that was quite good compared to others and it had that proper Mexican taste.
There were many options available in Jain.
One can go and give it a try to different varieties !!"

"RELISH located in Chruchgate is one of the restaurants which serves delicious food at affordable prices. The ambiance of the place is also happening, not to overpowering just subtle paintings and nice decor. It is only opened till 11pm,so if you are planning to go uske phele hi jana varna fir tata bye bye entry nahi dege.
We had ordered:
Paneer shashlik sizzler (4.5/5): The sizzler is enough for 2-3 people. The taste was smexy the mexican sauce served along the sizzler was going so well.
Mexicano pizza (Jain) : Best thing we had over there. The taste of the pizza was just ineffable. The crushed nachos over the pizza was giving that perfect crunch. I really wished I could show you all...read more"
Superrrr Yum!!
overall excellent food...everybody relished it....
