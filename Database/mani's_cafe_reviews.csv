"Food quality is good. I think you should give spoon how we can eat poha, shira, n upma without spoon."
Podi idli used to have more podi masala - it was dry today -
vada is oily

Taste is good so is the portion size. apt Sunday breakfast place.
quantity of Sambar should be increased.
""
quantity of coconut chutney was less
""
Wrong items were delivered
"Mani 's quality has gone down. The sambar was tasteless. vadas were not fully cooked.

overall a big disappointment. I will not order again."

"Upma was sweet, which should not be sweet.
and dosa's packaging was not at all okay. I'm in a hotel room, and do not have a plate, bowl, spoon etc.
The sambhar and coconut chutney were in pouches, how can some one eat it, and that to without a spoon.
The food packing should be in such a way that the person ordering need not to bother about, how to eat it."

Should have sent in container. I had asked also for cutlery. How am I supposed to have Sambhar and chutney without bowls now?
medu vada had bread crumbs on it and it was very oily as well and was smelling very bad
"Upma is uncooked and badly uncooked. Perhaps majnu orders to handle.

they are putting pic of dahi vada in dal vada. so I got dal vada thinking I ordered dahi vada. taste is good though."
""
Even after specifically asking for cutlery it wasn't sent. For 1 dosa 3 packet of nariyal chutney was sent which eventually I had to throw. The food was okayish not that bad not that good.

amazing and delicious food
the chutney came in plastic bags. which was impossible to enjoy due to outdoor eating. container would have made a good impact

Spring dosa not cut into pieces as shown in pics
Too much sugar and flavoured sheera.
