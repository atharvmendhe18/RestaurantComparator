Quality of oil was strange. Sticky and peculiar foul smelling

Very bad taste... please do not go here....
"We went there for dinner in evening.
We ordered paneer Tikka starter and pot biryani none of it was worth eating. paneer was dry and raw, marination was missing.
Pot Biryani was plain masala rice just put in a pot and served on table.
The staff there was least concerned when expressed regarding the food quality to which they said ki ""this is what it is""

I absolutely do not suggest this restaurant to anyone. One star was the least rating I could give.
Biggest scam in Nerul area.
Horizon is Horrible"
Good. Can be less oily
Too oily

"I have received only Chicken Bhuna .

"Just love it, going to order again and again"

Not even 10% close to actual kunafa. Regret ordering this.
"It was super good, only I want HORIZON to maintain is Quantities of there Food, Overall - 8.5/10"
"chicken pot biryani i had ordered. so i order biryani usually by calling them and the restaurant delivers but last week they said that their delivery person was not available. i asked them if they were on swiggy or zomato the person told me about zomato so i ordered the 2 chicken pot biryani's the biryani was as it was for the past 3 years. I ordered today from Zomato again because it had some offer, i ordered 1 chicken pot biryani and it was awfull, the pieces in the biryani were different and the biryani was not good and was not the same it was as if some masala was mixed with white steam rice. I called them they said POT Biryani is like this only,but last week it was different i told...read more"

Waste of money

Same as above
the tomato gravy with the chicken khabsa thali was spoilt...
"Visited this place yesterday. It's small restaurant in Nerul seating capacity is low...the staff seems to be rude.
We ordered khepsa Rice and chicken bhuna.
The taste of the food was very average but the price and quantity was something I feel agitated at.
The quality of the food was good but quantity was not enough."

"And we ordered capsa,rice don't know what they serve Food .was not good we didn't get what we thought.and price is so hight According to the food, the price should not have been the same."

Nothing but donâ€™t compromise food quality and taste.
Very dry
It seems that the food delivered was not from Horizon or may be Horizon is supplying inferior quality food when you order on Zomato . Worst experience
"over priced, also zomato taking more price"
""
good taste
"Very bad quality food... I ordered Chicken Kepsa.. they are just fooling the customers showing a photos of the food. When u actually order the same, u will get something else only... Very bad experience with this hotel.. and the best part, they don't have any regrets... My Suggestion : Never ever try the food from this hotel."

pungent cinnamon taste blant
Pathetic restaurant service
in discription they mentioned serves to 2 people. but the quantity is very less
It was not full chicken and packing was pathetic
""
"Taste less quality we are regular customers of yours if we get this type of food full of taste less not properly marinated really we are upset from this order actually i order for my wife and she was on diet

So sorry but not happy"
French fries and vegetable salad should be given separate as it becomes wet
The taste didn't justify comparative to its price. Bit busy so waiting time is more and not worth it. Don't miss to try fruit champagne
food was cold and shawarma was very cold...........
""

tasteless food very less quantity they say it serve 2 but it serves only one on top of it the kansa rice very tasteless
it was not lebanese grill chicken and didnt give the pita bread
Shame to the Lebanese cuisine. high time improvement required!
Mandi is gandi man we 4 had food and started puking next morning dr told all 4 had gotnfood poisoning worst place avoid chicken was smelljng and the owners wont even look at you when you complain they put some appy and soda and lime and serve you as fruit champagne and when you question its too sweet or add salt they say its appy what can we do if its sweet it prepackaged product worst management AVOID THIS PLACE FOLKS
expected with pot but not recieved. Price is too high for this quantity. Not for Biryani lovers
"The naan and rotis were half baked
The portion of the curry was pathetically small
Pot Biryani I heard was very good here but disappointingly nowhere close to a normal Biryani that you get anywhere else"
"Hummus... best one i had... freshest and ""order- for-second-time"" good


Usually the most crowded place in evening by the lebanesse food lovers."
We had ordered caramel custard and chicken lollipop the portions were good enough and the taste was absolutely delicious only drawback is high price
"How I wish I knew where to start if I have to sing plaudits about this restaurant! If you're passionate about mughlai and arab cuisines, Horizon is the place to be! No wonder this small restaurant tucked away in a corner of Nerul attracts patrons from as far as south Mumbai. Lipsmacking food that isn't heavy on your wallet is the hallmark of this restaurant.
My friend and I began with mutton shorba soup that was simply delicious. Pieces of mutton in shorba that had the most amazing combination of spices. It was rich in flavours and yet not at all heavy or dripping with melted mutton fat. The best paya soup I've ever had! The khamiri roti served along with it was soft, fluffy and extremely...read more"
Terrible imitation of what they think is Arabic food. Original mandi is very different from what this restaurant serves and passes as mandi. It was basically deconstructed akhni pulao with nuts? Mandi doesn't have nuts and raisins it isnt sweet let alone this bland.
