Review
"The place is always lively, decors and seatings are satisfactory. The DJ spins the wheel till late night.
Staff are prompt with services, sheesha are reasonable and are good as well.
Overall a nice lounge to visit if you are looking for good sheesha’s"
"This was the first place I had sheesha in my life. Was a first time experience and was really impressed by the service and location, roof top.

The sheesha is very nicely made and also the have some very good food combos. I personally like the pizza, the garlic bread and the Maggie.

The place is reasonable and also try not to go on a typical hot day or u will not like it much."
"Nice place ... The ambience is decent, service is good... It's open till late night and the DJ is really good... Plays good music... Food is also good... Had pasta and the place is worth trying it ...."
"Excelled place to hangout with friends ambience , music , quality of food and quality of sheesha is up to the mark .

Staff is really friendly and understand customers needs . Special mention to Mr.Pradeep who is very friendly and manages order very well .

A must visit place to all my frnds .. give a try you won’t be disappointed.

"Superb sheesha Nd awesome food.
A must visit place in malad.
Staff is very nice.
Paneer starter Nd pizza are the best.
Pasta are awesome...."
Cute little cafe-lounge with amazing sheesha that you can have while sitting on the swing! The new and modified ambiance makes it look elite and the new additions in their menu are worth the try!
"Hi there, I would like to rate this place accordingly
Ambience - 7
Pizza - 4
Cheese garlic bread - 4
Coffee - 7
Hukka was the best part.. I ordered Paan salsa
And other was blueberry mint
Food is not that wow"
Ambience was bad...food was worse...n service was even worse..if u just want to waste money...or have hookah..u may go..otherwise no need..my choice on it wud be a dhaaba will be much better...this reminds me of one popular hindi saying....Naam bade aur darshan chote... Just name..AIR LOUNGE ...NO WAYS GUYS
"Air Lounge: Malad
Sheesha is good here around the vicinity
Potato wedges were perfect blend in taste!
And Melting Cheese Sandwich became my favorite dish of the day❤
Good Air, Perfect Sheesha Venue"
The service is very bad.I came here for the first time and the service which i got here was very bad the waiter was very rude when asking for the food menu he took 10 mins to bring it and after asking what is the speciality here he is like i dnt know(You all see what u all like).I was like lets leave (as we have already ordered Sheesha).i asked him for the bill and the worst part was he is like we dont take cards. In todays world who give cash ha..Really very worst experience. Will not recommend to any one.
"Rooftop concept ,live screening DJ wont let you down ,food nd sheesha is great and pocket friendly thy hv some amazing combos for sheesha,food n beverages.a bit crowded on weekends evening the only turn off is u hv to order sheesha every hour u cannot sit by only ordering food or beverages."
"A good place to chill with your friends. Ambience is pretty good. It's fine if you're here for sheesha, but I didn't find food really appealing to me. Totally opposite of generally how the air or sky lounges are. You step out of the lift and you see their kitchen all messed up and untidy and then you see the entrance for the lounge. This place is expensive for now damn reason."
A nice place to visit with friends. Ambience was very good. Dj was okay. Food was awesome. Sheesha lovers...sheesha was nice. Overall the place is too good to hangout with friends
"Visited this lovely place yesterday evening, we totally fell in love with the ambience. The food here was very tasty. We mainly tried their paneer varients and totally relished them.
Besides this, they have a live screening of IPL, which is so cool and so much fun to watch with a large group of friends while doing Sheesha. All in all an Amazing Rooftop and Sheesha Restaurant."
Quite a Decent place with Sports screening and Music. Sheesha and Service is good and Ambience and the crowd is good to Chill out on a rooftop!
"Air lounge: 
They made us wait for 45mins to enter the lounge as they were still cleaning and setting up. Stepping out of the life, you can see an open kitchen which isn't maintained well and nor the chefs are even wearing gloves to cook. 

Ambience: It's an open terrace, with pretty lights. Poorly maintained furniture. Live screening is available. The view was beautiful. There was good ventilation and provision for coolers. 

Staff: They are decent and fairly quick as well.

Hookah: Ordered the 'double apple pan' flavoured hookah, suggested by the staff itself, it was great and quite strong! 

Beverages :

Kiwi Exotica : Crushed ice with kiwi flavour juice was quite refreshing and...read more"
"Love for open terrace lounge, visit after 6pm to enjoy the lights. Nyc sheesha with good offer on combos, only problem is its veg.
Please try to keep non veg food & drinks."
"Air Lounge, A Lounge In The Suburbs Of Malad. It's one Of The Terrace Seating Places in the town. But you don't need to worry to visit the place in the afternoon because there are plastic sheets which cover the place from Heat and The Air Conditioner's then take over 😉 To be precise the Ambience in the evening after the Lights Are Turned on is one of a kind at least in Malad. The Sheesha here Is Average. Sometimes There are real Huge Clouds and Sometimes it just chocks you.Double Apple+Rasna and Orange + Mint is the best You Can Try here. The Normal Sheesha Starts at Rs650. There are Live Performance's of Various Band's on the weekends. Though the biggest Turn off of the place is the...read more"
Pathetic food to even try on...The drink I ordered and the garlic bread all was just sad..Please improvise...Even issues with hygiene...plz improve
"I heard about this place way back never had the opportunity to visit, but until yesterday.....
I went there with my friends around 11.pm, well due to Saturday it was over crowded and there was a waiting (where 10 mints turned out to be 45 mints)
Poor and unorganised management.

Ambience is good, food is OK. Sheesha is a saviour.
Music is OK
They also do have a screen. So ipl live streaming is what you can expect.

Recommended flavour - kiwi 🥝 + supari + salsa
Recommended food - eat only if you are damm hungry. (Garlic bread)
Recommended time to visit - after evening.👌🏿

Ratings -
Food - 2/5
Music - 2/5
Ambience - 3/5
Sheesha - 4/5

Worth a try, not recommended for regular...read more"
"This is the first rooftop lounge i have visited so for me this place is amazingly good.
Cant describe the peace i feel being there, you actually at top of the world 😊
Sheesha- 7/10
Food- 8/10
Ambiance-8/10
Well maintained place
White sauce pasta is not to be missed here😋
Maggi pasta is the real delicacy they can add more twist to it by adding veggies💖
And pasta pizza too 😋😋"
"Nice place to hangout with your friends. Good ambience, slow and soft music. Cheese maagi and a melting cheese sandwhich should be a must try menu item."
"Most pathetic place I have ever been to.. these guys don't even accept cards for payment and will make u run here n there for it... they want hard cash..and when asked for the reason..they say that they r running it for past 2 years but haven't got that.. because they don't feel the need... moreover, the food is worst.. tasteless..
When India is going digital, ppl like them still want to live with cash because they have space to cheat.. I would suggest not to go at this place.."
"What do i say about Air lounge!! Its my second home...love to be thr all the time..fun loving ambience, friendly staff!! Pradip, Chandan, Sharad nd food staff, coal changer nd hookah maker!! Fun loving enviorment!! Best place to hangout wid frnds!! #LiveSinging #Awesome singer.. #MangalDubey #Asmik #TheInternBand #Games #OpenTerrace!! #FastFood #frenchfries!!"
"Hookah is good for the price , ambience is good and food is average & service is slow the staff feel like a bunch of teenager without uniform and during night its much crowded u have to wait outside for a good time to get a seat"
Loved the place completely # had gone thr for my bday# v didn't feel like going back home.... gud music# quick service# loved the ambience too
Good Ambiance. Hookah flavours are very good. Its truely the Air Lounge. Pizza and Garlic bread are really very tasty. Overall food is Good. Nice Seating arrangement. Dj is very fantastic. Location is in the heart of malad. Overall good place to visit.
"❤️💨💨💨💨💨💨💨 Loved the ambiance, great sheeshaaa, good music beautiful interior, and loving people !! Best sheesha by far in mumbai and food.
Thanks for a great evening !! ❤️❤️❤️"
"I've visited the place today at 6:30 pm the place is OK but service is too bad and the food quality is not good . The time of payment I get know this restaurant doesn't have swipe machine the owner send me with one on his waiter ,it was so weird that in this generation this ancient restaurant only take cash payment totally worst place to hangout...."
"Yes! This is THE ""coolest""place i have ever been to.. The atmosphere there is magically awesome with the best hukka n lit music n pleasant ambience.. . N yes the staff so good making u comfortable..for me This is the best Lounge happened to Malad so far✌"
"Been here on a Sunday with some friends, Good Atmosphere, Live Music etc

But, strongly needs to work on the Staff, we didn't order a Sheesha (Hookah) and directly went on to order our food.

Hence forth the service was Pathetic, the Waiter was foolish enough to ask us to windup as there were other Guest waiting ignoring that, we have not finished the meal on the table.

Finally, we got a Bill for our meal that was like a Paper without any Hotel Registration Details. We have updated a pic for all to see.

Never to visit again.... Not at all Recommended...."
The rating is only for the ambience apart from that the sheesha overpriced food overpriced n service ok bt it's truly a waste of money n specially for couples
"Loved this place and felt like going back there again n again!! The owner of the place was courteous enough to get the parking gates open even before valet arrives, on one single call aswell as the place is done simple but very beautiful and the staff is spontaneous as well, good place to go in eve as the breeze passes and also the place is lit!"
"Yesterday I visited this place along with ma friends i love the place 😍
Proper n comfortable sitting.
The service provided was outstanding.
I loved the pink sauce pasta.
The sheesha was jus ri8.
The lights the music was jus right.
Will surely visit again."
"This place is one of the coolest place to hangout with friends . If you are a hukka lover..you are surely gonna love this place. The ambience is amazing. The feeling you get over this place is immense. Service is good. Nice sitting arrangements, affordable and sort of cheap menu. In short a sasta tikau place for hukka and starters ❤
Happy customer!

"As heard this place is quite good for the sheesha... visited second time, both the time my experience is as i expected... but they need to work on cleanliness, rest everything is good. Also they need to work for the taste of food."
Good service ..really good food must come must try especially after the nee food menu worth a visit ..good sheesha service their suggestions always work
"BEST PLACE FOR SHEESHA LOVERS.....ESPECIALLY B3 , BLUE MIST N KIWI BLAST ONE...... N FOR FOOD TRY PIZZAPASTA , KURKURE , N CHEESE CHILLY TOAST..... $$$ RATE CHART IS ALSO REASONABLE."

Ambience: 4.5
Music:4
Food:4.5
Its a must visit place!!!☝👌🍻🍺"
"Reached here around 4:30 pm with a friend ,the place is extremely dirty at the first sight .
we ordered for a combo of rs999 which included hookah, pizza/pasta , garlic bread and ice tea! But they didn't have any ice tea so had to order for thumbs up.. we ordered for apple mint flavour which was a very disappointing flavour.. we hardly taste the flavour .. on asking the person to change/ make it strong he just stood there having the hookah for 5 minutes and didn't do anything..
and also the servers just stand near your table awkwardly staring at you!

The food was good , we called for garden fresh pizza and cheese garlic bread .
Garden fresh pizza was a thin crust pizza with all...read more"
A good place to chill out with friends with Good Ambience. An amazing place to relax. Have been there twice and felt an amazing service there. Food is not the first concern there but still food is quiet amazing and yeah Sheeshas not to be forgotten & . Amazing flavours & quick service. Staff is too good and well behaved. All together will love to go there again.
"Bad food... bad service....
All they do diligently is change coals for the sheesha i ordered.
Asked for water, they gave me a water bottle,asked for a glass to serve my water,they dint have a glass.
They dont accept old currency nor have a card machine.
Dont go by the images the place is really not worth going.
The way the bouncer outside asks for id card i felt ""wow must be a good place"" but totally disappointing."
"Visited this place at like around 4.00pm
There was nobody at the lounge and still they had sitting restrictions!
Ordered a Sheesha which was Okayish.
The service was bad inspite of nobody else being in the lounge!
Unethical local waiters!
They didn't even have French fries!
Peach ice tea too was just the ice and peach syrup!
Just a place with good ambience.
Also on requesting thrice they played some music finally!
Expensive for no reason!
You step out of the lift and you see their kitchen all messed up and then enter the lounge!😂"
"Visited this place post lunch yesterday, they serve decent hookah, apparently the kitchen was shut and they said the food would be available after 5pm! We ordered for the cheese corn pizza which was too bland and expensive. The service was quick but the entire roof area was dirty, unhygienic. They can really do better. And, they do not accept cards for payment! I mean, really?"
"Not really as fancy as it looks in the pictures. No fans except a humidifier and on the terrace. Not really apt or recommended for this kind of weather.

The hukka/sheesha is the saving grace. Good flavours and good service here. If that is the only requirement of tour evening, do visit here.

The food here is of no mentionable quality. Even though cheap its worth a miss. Gralic bread was ok and the nachos were triangular chips from a doritos packet or something similar. Disappointed when it comes to food.

All in all skippable place"
"I found this place very ok than I thought how it would be .
Ambience is good. Prices are high.
Quality of Hukka and food have totally gone down.
I tried the Hukka which was extremely pricy and not upto the mark in according to what they charge.
Management should look into this as there many better places opened close by if they want to run this place for long run.
They don't accept cards unlike other Hukka parlours.
Crowd is not suitable for couples."
"Can anybody here tell me whether they have Indoor sitting arrangement as well or is it just outdoor??

I would have to visit the place before reviewing it. the owner doesn't pick up the calls, that's very unprofessional first of all."
"This place was too much into rumours for its huka, but it aint that pleasant. There was no functioning of ac you will feel hot after a timing. Huka was also not upto the mark. Ambience quiet oki. Dunno where thngs went wrong with them when they were at lead on link road. Music was also not..."
Amazing place.. Amazing hookah.. Wasn't really expecting much from this place but its awesome.. We ordered mozaic kiwi flavor in hookah and it was wonderful.. We also ordered nachos with cheese and salsa and it was yumm!!! Great ambiance and great music..very nice place if you want to enjoy good hookah and good time with friends.. Service was good too!!! Must visit :)
"A place specially for the sheesha lover. Has a rooftop sitting area with a in house dj in the Centre. I visited this place in the night. Yes. It was completely pack but what made me wait for it was the psychedelic trance music. Must must try is cottage cheese garlic bread. Service is pretty slow but it was worth the wait. The ambience is with a blue color light theme. Which adds a different vibe to the sheesha lovers.
Must visit !"
"I didn't try to taste the food because kitchen is open and not clean properly.
D location n ambience is good..
Price of sheesha is too much as compare to zinc.
There are more then 7 AC in that but all ac's  are not working.
Service is good."
Today 1more visit towards air lounge..with a new experience the sheesha on the rocks was amazing and visitors must try garden fresh pizza it was just delicious..this visit was seriously worth without any complaints..thank u Mr.Salman
"Initially the place when It opened was really good
Sad to see it go down now !!
The place is ok now
The lightings have changed
The service has become slow
The quality of huKKah has gone down
The food is ok
And compared to other sheesha parlor the prices are high !!
Hope they try to better it soon"
"With amazing ambience, it serves you good food, speacially the nachos and the paneer tikka pizza. Most important its sheesha.... with no change in smoothness of smoke and amazing flavour even after a long tym
Once again in air lounge on d same day..love d live band...thanks smith n salman bhai for calling mangal dubey...frndshps day was worth spending here
Enjoying d band to d core..with all due respect mangal dubey u r fab..ur song DUA😍😍😍😍"
"3rd visit after the complimentary Sheesha from the owner.
Again I would say the place was stinking and furnitures Dirty AF, the flavor suggested by the guy was crap and seriously speaking not at all worth spending.

First of all I really wanna appreciate the management especially Salman Bhimani! Today I went to Air Lounge again and the sheesha really made me happy plus the service was extremely good! I texted Salman before I went to this place and he called me up asking about the service which his team gave us today. Which shows that they really care about the service they provide to their customers."
So people ignore the previous review air lounge management is so caring and keen about their customers that when they got to know about my previous bad experience... They personally contactd and interacted with me took my feedback and arranged a new sheesha n food session for me that too complementary and seriously a great improvement I experienced the sheesha was amazing this time my girlfriend visited along with me and she was really happy having that amazing sheesha...Even the service improved a lot this is what is called customer building and truly this time they gained my loyalty towards their outlet..Thank you so much Mr.Salman we really had good time this time and surely we had...read more
"Well, i visited the outlet, ambience was superb. Flavour of sheesha was amazing.service 5/5. Food was also very yummy. Music, food, sheesha and lot more. Do visit once. Worth it."
"The service was too laid back..
Food was very average.. The place is defi attracting d teens..
But they need to improve their food and service..
The pizza base was burnt but thr was no crispiness..
The pasta was below average, too tangy..
D saviour was d corn with cheese and onion..
D location n ambience is good..
But rest all was disappointing..
Hope they change few basics.. "
"Beautiful ambiance, elegantly designed interior, blue moon lights amazing flavours , delicious Italian food love this place !!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love with Air !!!!"
It's our second home . We visit twice a week . Nice place to sit & relax with friends. The sheesha are great. No doubt the Ambience is superb as it a rooftop with white & blue interior. Service is great & friendly . Dj plays good music & also plays songs of our suggestions.
"I have uploaded a pic of the kitchen. One look at it should dispel all notions of visiting here. The stall is seomthing akin to what you would find on the road outside Mithibai. They give handwritten bills. The food is bad, the service ponderous and slower than a snail's pace.

The only good thing is the Hookah but it stops there. The ambience is not that great either. Skip it."
So I saw the pic of air lounge on zomato i hv been there wid frends so ..... first problem we faced is parking thn i enter in the lounge thn the things started service and staff is of this lounge is teenage boys who dont pay much attention to guest. sheesha i order which came after waiting for 15 min ac of this place do not work at all after having hookah i asked staff for bill which was they gave me on time bt when i said can i swipe my card for payment so they refuse for card.... i paid by cash tht also i hv to go to cash counter coz no waiter was there to collect .... wtf... Big No to Air lounge ..... never visiting this place again
"A pretty chilledout rooftop place that has good music , amazing ambience and killer hokkah. The pricing of hukka is cheap. The view from the location is quite good. This place is always crowded. Weekends are happening here. Tried pasta nad fries here along with hukka which were super duper awesome. Variety of Hukka here is good. Service is really nice!!"
Been to air lounge for many times now. Its a rooftop hookah lounge. A must-go for all sheesha lovers. The best time to visit this place is after 6 pm. The interior is neatly done up. Will remind you of asilo bar and its located nearby my office as well. A guy named chandan is very helpful. He takes proper care of coals. Management is good. Service is awesome.

"To start with its located bang opposite infinity mall so if u r out for a outing at infinity and u wanna try some good lively place AIR LOUNGE is a place to be starting with as the name suggest it gives a breezy feeling and it's made such nicely that u fall in love with the ambience

Coming to staff and services they r really polite and helpful and bang on their work specially Pradeep and Sam the sheesha are really super with best flavours and excellent combination

Next on to food it is also amazing though they hv a restricted menu but very well set up to go with sheesha

And the music there is bang on well made dj console played by dj Vaibhav playing best music

Very slow service..ambience is good..never go during day time..hukaah is okay not as i had thought 😊there is only 1 person for taking care of the guest must increase the workers 🖐🏻
"No! Simply... NO!!!! NO NO NO
I had heard of this place and my friend suggested it as a late post mid night resort! So after glocal, we thought we'd crash here till maybe 2 or so!
We entered and it was as shady as it could be!
I ain't going to this place again, ever!
It is not like it looks in the photos!! Don't even go because of the good reviews!
It looks extremely shady!

Staff- uhh... If you are able to grab their attention then:2/5
Food- we order pasta pizza something,bad-1.5/5
Music- it's something my shady friend would play some Bollywood top lists in his/her car: 2/5

Was waiting to see this place for long tym.. Finally headed up here... Coming here in starting led to disappointment as there was no fan or ac working or either it was occupied... It was super hot... Later the food was gud... Quick service... Pocket fit...at end got the gud table.. Nice place to hangout after 8...bcoz loud music starts after 8.
"Spot for sheesha lovers. Nicely done up decor in blue lights, this place has achieved good popularity in vicinity.

The quality of the Sheesha can be improvised a bit as per what they charge."
Been there with colleagues after office it was a stress buster experience. Had a great time there. Perfect flavours good service good ambience good crowd good food.
Certainly the best seating arrangement as far as the Sheesha place is concerned... Good airy open terrace...Decent food and service... Great value for money
"A good place for hookah lovers...The lighting there makes the ambience good and being on a terrace the place is windy...
Haven't tried anything on their food menu yet but I would recommend this place only for hookah lovers"
"Had been to this place on last Sunday
Amazing ambience great music
Sheesha is amazing
Staff is really cool
Limited menu for obvious reasons of being a sheesha lounge but still it's too Tasty + pure veg
A great place to be on a casual evening
Overall experience-amazing"
"The very first thing is cool ambience....

Nice seating....open sky lounge (as name says air lounge.).

Crowd is good on weekends....hookah's are good.. and best part is food is also good...we tried pasta pizaa with white sauce..that was dammm good."
"I personally found the place very OK. The good part about the place the ambience and the lightning. Never ever call for nachos with cheese because you will end up getting some shit quality nachos with grilled amul cheese. Dear management, That's now how you serve nachos with cheese. Anyway, I am never going here again."
Air loungue has one of the best ambience that a rooftop can offer. When you go to air u need to ask for Pradeep he is d ultimate guy at air loungue. Also u have to have red ice n b3 made by pradeep at air which is one of the best sheeshas ever..! Pradeep you are the best man hatts off to you...Visit this place especially after 7.00 to get the real feel wid feet tapping dj n blue neon lights along wid amazing continental food..!!
"It has been one good place after another! If you love sheesha, take time out of your schedule and visit this place once and you'll have loved to make this decision. Went here on a sunday and the place was buzzing with people. Immediately got a table for 6 surprisingly. The sheesha is quite amazing, even better is the way they are always ready to listen to you and adhere to your demands as i hardly had to wait to be attended. The food is absolutely delicious. Do not miss the 'pasta on pizza' , it will completely blow you away."
