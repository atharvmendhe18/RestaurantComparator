"Hello ,
It was our daughters 6th Birthday and we were searching for some good Cake shops in and around Thane.Thats when my Wife suggested to try Artesano. We went with the Red Velvet chocolate cake and placed an order.The cake was exactly what we wanted - soft, delicious and also the design was perfectly done.The cake tasted like heaven. The kids were very happy and all couldnâ€™t wait to get their hands on the cake, thats how tempting it was. 
Thanks Artesano.

Suchita created an amazing and probably one of the best designer cake for a wedding anniversary theme...The cake was not only beautiful but also tasted total yum... Thank you so much for incorporating all my imagination into the cake
"Suchita at Artesano she is simply too good and totally justifies the brand what she has created .... her cakes are art and the details in the cakes are just perfect...
The cakes look so beautiful you will not feel to cut them. Coming to taste, it's too good and extremely fresh... she is little expensive, but then the details are just to the perfection and every penny is worth it...
Without even you have tasted the cake, you can blindly order the cake... 6 cakes were ordered by me in the span of 2 months and none were of any disappointment... all were super yumm !!!"
"Suchita is a magician... She can ""Cake your dream come true""... Have ordered three times now... Absolutely amazed by her perfection and detailing... And to add to all of that it tastes delicious... What more can you ask for..."
"Loved loved the cake Suchita made for my son's 1st bday! From the design to the taste, and professional way she work ,everything was just perfect!
After that any occasion we order from Artesano-cake art by Suchita...
She makes yummmy Cupcake too...
