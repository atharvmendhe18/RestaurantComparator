"Good place to Hangout...
Although the staff is a pure scam here...
I booked the table through zomato carnival and stil when we got the bill, they said there can't be any carnival discounts provided even on food bills..
The management here will just keep lying you abt the things and the offers..
So pls do not book it through carnival fests for this restaurant . .
They will jus scam you up at Billing ."
not at all good

Mainly a hooka joint. For family the sitting is not great and smells and has mosquitoes.

Wonderful dinner experience
everything. that's the worst chana I had. also the delivery was delayed
"We had ordered a veg tandoori pizza , they served us a non veg pizza . This is literally against all our sentiments and us being a jain we didn’t realise it until the waiter came to us with the actual order that was placed . This is really a foolishness of their under trained staff being unapologetic and rude that we had to walk off from the place . I wish we could take an action against them but eventually putting this review is the only way out so that people are aware that their staff is really pathetic . Not at all recommended !"
