Visiting dis place just means to ruin d evening"
"Angrezi Pub is one amongst the destinations for music and great drinks. They also have live music at times which is something every person loves.


The crowd was good and people loved the way they danced all through the evening. The music is loud and good and its difficult to strike conversations. Most of the time, I nodded and presumed what ever my buddy was talking to me (Ha Ha). Overall, the place receives lot of corporate crowd especially on Mondays. Wednesdays is time for the ladies ""Ladies Night"". booze is complimentary for ladies- on Wednesdays


Both starters were perfectly cooked and marinated specially the chicken. Just loved the Murg Tandoori

A mad evening place... weekends are totally insane the music the food and the ambience all go together too well... its place were you can party hard and forget the night the next day what here stays there!Ritu Pandit OimFashion
"The Angrezi Pub located at CBD offers a good getaway for parties and hangouts. The ambiance is really nice with extremely comfortable sitting arrnagement. Music is peppy and loud and compliments well with the lightening arrnagement. Wednesdays is ladies special day. Unlike weekends even weekends are full of fun. The staff is courteous and serive is quick. Food is also nice though menu does not offers vide variety but sufficiently enough to call for many flavours. Angrezi Pub offers a cool-n-yo place to chill, relax and hangout with your loved ones."
Best for new year blasts üòéüòéüòé unlimited drinks and unlimited food and DJ's and crazy crowd . Smoking room does become crowded and packed . üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Firstly the place is too loud, hence not everyone would like this place. The place is huge (in terms of seating and the dance floor), music played wasn't that great. Now coming to the food, it's quite expensive and heavy on pockets same with alcohol. Staff members behavior is not good (my personal opinion).
In case you really want to get high and footloose, then this place is apt."
"Rude behavior towards customers...DJ sucks..very boring songs so no use of dance floor.. disappointed üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé low quality dj
Even food quality is very low."
"Went here on a Wednesday evening and luckily for us, It was ‚ÄòLadies and Models Night‚Äô. Had free drinks till 10 pm. Good range of cocktails and drinks were available. Obviously, the alcohol was very diluted since they were complementary. Nonetheless, we had a good buzz. The Dj played good songs so we hit the dance floor for hours together. We had chicken lollipops and tandoori chicken. The food was SUPER EXPENSIVE. Quantity was good but not worth the money they charged. Ambience was ok. We weren‚Äôt happy with the lighting. Overall, it‚Äôs an ok place. Definitely not easy on the pocket on normal days."
"A little loud for visiting with kids and family. Ambience is quite impressive,Food quality is good and tasty but a little harsh on your pocket. Over all a good place to hang out with friends."
"Visted the place last week Saturday night on 2nd dec 2017. Ambience was ok. Dance floor is huge but DJ was the worst that they had hired for this saturday
. He continuously played some boring Punjabi songs all along. Had no option but to dance on those beats. Waiter and service was pathetic. The waiter kept bugging me all the time for refilling of my drink even when I was dancing like nagging ""Sir refill kar du kya, Sahab ek aur drink lelo and all that bullshit"". When i asked him normal water he brought a mineral water and told me that they dont have normal water, only packaged water whereas the normal water was available with them. I was nagged  to refill my drink several times and once...read more"
Awesome place to hangout and also serve awesome food . Also the DJ plays wonderful music and also the lighting sense is mind-blowing .do visit to enjoy life to its fullest .
Went there on a Saturday with friends. It was very quite for a Saturday. Food was just ok and rates are too high. Ambience is good but they need to work on their menu and prices a bit.
"One of the few happening places near belapur. Saturdays are loud and decent crowd. If one needs to drink alone .. not the place.. If you have people you can dance your way in and out ! The food and drinks.. Both here are overpriced, considering the crowd and ambience. They were out of draught beer, so if you want to drink like a fish not the place to go. The food was delicious and the service was quick, so that's all they win the point for. Looking forward to some good changes in their menu or else it was just a one time show !"
"Good - Good music, great dance floor, nice ambience, decor, decent food, nice place to chill with friends

Bad - Cover charge, super expensive drinks, no free water"
The place is really good to hangout with friends.Course and drinks provided on the menu are really good.The place is really maintained nice.
"Went on a 'Retro Sunday', which is stamped at the entry. The margarita pizza and the chicken sizzler were splendid, But the ambience and service were equally great!

Mojito for my old man, Heart attack for me...refreshing cocktailsüçπü§òüèΩ

Thank you!"
Cool place to hang out wid ur frnds and ofcourse galfrnd..Lols....awesome environment...awesome dj....n d dance floor is really awsme..one must visit dis place once..paisa wasool...
"One of the best pubs in CBS belapur . They have a restaurant on the ground floor and the pub on the first floor. The food was nice especially the Paneer shots and Angrezi special pizza(may not be on the menu) . Dance floor is big enough to accommodate most of the crowd and the lightings effects will surely leave you a little trippy.
Overall a nice place to let your hair down after a long week."
"All hail the angrezi...!!
Best chiken tandoori tikka i have ever had..!! Foot was awesome üíì 5/5 for food
Music was good also the dancefloor.
Good ambience good food.
A place must go on weekends.. üíì"
"Angrezi Pub has been always a good place for our partys, but this time it was some next level entertainment. The ""octobeer"" festival has been a bomb!!!!! The food was always good and the drinks are also affordable. The hosts are awesome like always. Keep up the good work."
"After 3rd visit i write down review for this pub and that Music is awsome
Friendly staff
Best is ashok das

In one word is that magnetic spot"
"Everything was good last night. The waiter was very helpful, food was also good. Dj was average sorry that would be as per my taste...! Space can be a bit bigger"
"Was travelling to Belapur along with friends while we wanted to explore some nightlife options. Food, service, drinks all were excellent. Limited options for vegetarians though. Overall, a nice place to catch up with some old friends over chilled beers!!!"
"Good ambience, prompt service, music is also of good mixing of Bollywood nd Hollywood , food is not up to the mark , overall prefer to give rating 3"
"Lack of maintenance in the restaurant made it unappealing. The plaster on the walls was coming off, seats were torn, waiters could not communicate well. . . We asked for a suggestion for what good do they have in non veg starters and he was lost. . .finally we ordered something of our own.
The food was good, but the time taken to serve it was way too much. . .overall not so good experience. . !"
"Was there last night with my bestiee in Angrezi pup Navi Mumbai very friendly welcoming place to spend a awesome time .  All personnel were very well trained, accommodating and helpful (all done with a smile).  Everything was handled with efficiency and
attention to every detail was given.  Food was delicious and the view was wonderful while dining. Thanks for doing such an outstanding job to make the stay so pleasurable. and the environment was too much awesome, very polite and nice.The combination of food, environment and staff make the guests comfortable and respected.@riya purshwani"
"Expected much better music specially on a Saturday night. Place was small and cluttered.. Not the best dance floor..
The place seemed popular for the above reasons and it was quite disappointing."
"Been here for my birthday - great ambience, music and food though can create a hole in your pocket if it's you who is treating with lots of booze and food.
Overall a good experience though this pub allows couple entries only, wherein we faced a little issue as one of my cousin was left alone but then some how we managed."
It was very worst service I have ever got in my life by spending so much money and the food was also not good I will suggest it is waste of time and money rly it is a loot on a name of pub and musice for which we pay.......
"Had been here a month ago and spent some good time with my friends. We arrived at 9.30pm; the music was too loud and made it difficult to have any conversation, we literally had to shout at the attendant's ear to place our order.
The interiors was classy, the lightings were dim and presence disco lights made it perfect for dancing.
Food and beverages are expensive here so if you are just looking for drinks, food, conversations and not dancing then this may not be the right place.
We ordered some moctails and I loved the fruit fantasy one. It was amazing. Dance floor was packed after 10 pm and everyone were having fun. The DJ played a wide range of songs and crowd kept cheering. Overall It...read more"
"Navi Mumbai, I always being judgemental about but TAP broke that stretotypes. It's a good place to be especially on Friday Night, If your filmy and ready for Bollywood's Thumka.
Food: Yummmmm. Tried several starters with drinks and everytime it was better. Veg is also worth trying.
Ambience: Young crowd.
Music: Good. When you high it turn out to be Mast.
Staff: Ok.
Price: Expensive for the quality and quantity."

Delightful music

"Food is good....But the attitude of staff especially the bouncer(S.Kumar) is really not good. He was behaving too rudely. The Dj sounds as if he wants the floor empty around 11.30... Poor hospitality I wont visit it again even for free nor would I suggest it.
00 ratings for poor behaviour by staff"
"Nice Place, Nice Music & Ambience, Good Place to be with friends, Good Food, Service to be improved on, worth a try......................................"
Best tomato soup in town. Crispy bread crumbs and hot creamy soup. Must have in monsoon and winter. Rest food also good but could have been better.
The best pub in navi Mumbai. Friendly staff yummy food n beautiful ambience. DJ n dance floor rocking. Its full of fun at angrezi pub. I love to go n spend my evening with my friends.
"Very disappointing! First off, this is a really shady place. It's full of older people drunk dancing and acting weird. The music was horrible! The bouncers were rude on top of that! I decided not to drink cause I didn't want to get into a bad mood so I ordered food, it took quite some time to get to our table but it was good! That's the only reason I give this place a 2.5 honestly! Would suggest you skip it!"
This is the most disappointed place I have ever been. First my friend got molested by someone. Then the bouncers let tht person go with respect. Second after the club closed they are hoping us from here to there. Please don't ever visit this place.
Very pricey place. Music is good and they have a dance floor but it picks up only after 11. Alcohol and food both are quite heave on the pocket but you'll have a good night with the music. Service is good.
"Was there last evening with a bunch of colleagues...food was really awesome,be it pizza or even the starters...even the pricing was good... perfect ambience for a perfect evening... service was good, liquor was a bit expensive but not a thing to worry about as the rest factors cover up the thing...in short we had a great evening..."
Awesome place to do party with friends and family. I love the ambience. Tasty food with super fast service. I feel like it's a Club in London. Great hospitality. Keep it up.
"This place is the embodiment of the term 'rip-off'. First you are charged a cover of 1k per person. Then, when you enter the bullshit starts to unravel slowly.
They have all but 4 beers. Two of them imported. But to get this information you have to interrogate the waiter for an hour, who is spy-level immune to your questioning.
Still later we settle for a Bira pitcher for which the offer according to him was - one pitcher free on two pitchers. We order this, but to our dismay, he says he doesnt have enough of the only draught beer he had to fill 3 pitchers so he can't provide us that.
So, we decide that we'd had enough. We call it quits and still it takes a good half an hour of...read more"
"The 1 star here is just because it has to be. The worst place experienced so far.

The staff is totally rude and unfriendly. No one knows what is available with them. No one actually cares once you make the payment.

They don't have anything mentioned in the menu. You have to order to their liking and not what you need.

Brute, honestly. Totally brute."
"Visited this place on a Friday Night, one of my friend suggested me this place.
Its has a proper pub ambience with music and lights and everything. I choose to sit at the bar as thats where you ger your drinks first. It was a bollywood night so the DJ was playing all the remixed bollywood hindi music. I was expecting some 90s track but yeah. It was good.
The service is pretty fast and staff is courteous. They have an in built smoke room which is a good thing.
The prices are bit on the higher side and no happy hours.
Food was good and arrived fast.
The dance got a little crowded after some time and music got too loud.
Rest its a good place to chill on the weekend if you have a big...read more"
"Been here with a bunch of girls on the weekend and was not impressed by the shady crowd. The DJ was playing awful music and really the floor was occupied by stalkers who were eye balling every woman with sleaze personified. It was a disturbing experience and I'm not going there again. Sorry guys, the standards have dropped awfully."
"Food Good, Ambience Very Good, But DJ is worst, No Customer Worship, All The Staffs are not supportive, Manager is also not supportive. DJ is playing music for him only not for customer. And manager and staff are also supporting him for playing that music. DJ is playing only english music. No hindi music. If customer demands for hindi that is useless demand for him. In india you can not play hindi music. This place is total worst. I recommend dont go because no values of customers..."
"Excellent food and a great DJ. Nice ambience and prompt service.
Keep up the good work
We ordered peri peri chicken wings and lemon basil chicken tikka. Highly recommended for people looking for great food"
Visted last night with my office friends . It was happening place. The floor was on full fire ü§òü§òü§òü§òüç∑üçªüçæ DJ was energetic! The food was good . Over all good place 2hangout with your friends . The only thing was sad it close at 1.00 clock when actually enegry level started increasing atleast they should keep till 2.30 .it was wonderfull night ‚úå looking forward to visit again
"angrezi pub earlier known as indulge ..is 1 among few pubs in navi mumbai.. place. remains empty on weekdays however weekends. it is crowded ..can expect pretty crowd here staff is polite till 12 clock after 12 they start batting you out which. is quite indecent.. dj apprently yesterday played nice songs. usualyy its just average ambience is nice so i would so
food 7/10
ambienece 7/10
staff 5/10
music 6/10
value for money 6/10
overall 6/10

totally upon ur luck which day u go and what kind of staff table you face"
It was my company get together at the Angrezi Pub.I found this place is really good.Awesome food and cocktails with mind blowing music.Lovely ambience.Overall  my  experience was excellent.......
The Angrezi Pub is rocking all the time. Nice ambience to create party mood. Yummy food and excellent service. Love to come again and again. It's become my favourite hang out place. Thanks The Angrezi Pub team.
"It is a nice pub with good interior.
Ambiance is good.
I go there with my friend.
We ordered Drums Of Heaven and Pan fried spicy chicken.
Drums of heaven is very tasty but pan fried spicy chicken is not so good.
In drinks ..we have Sydney sunset which taste nice.
Drums of heaven is a type of chicken lollipop with great spices.
Ambiance-4/5
Taste-3/5
Service-3/5.
Dj is good but not so energetic."
"Well as i entered the place, there were dancing on and dj on full swing mode. As energetic the dj is, the music fusion failed to kick me in, probably just personal choice, but the ups and downs in pace is too random as a casual disc dancer not so gopd at dancing. The food is expensive and booze is too. But all in all experience was good and fun."
Its awsome only for Saturday nights.... as there is more crowd to dance with and to enjoy drink. The bar menus have a high pricing but the service is good
Nice ambience. Songs could be better . Drinks wow . Starters are mouth watering . Drums of heavens are out of this world..Hangout for best buddies .
"Music - good
Ambience- good
Rates- for drinks it's pretty high as they never serve pitchers although mentioned in the menu card
For food they are good enough
We had chicken pizza veg sizzlers chicken kabab and food quality was good. So no comllaints in regard to food quality

Place is a bit too crowded on weekends

Overall cover charge is also pretty high so u tend to east and drink just to cover those paid cover charges

But for outskirts of western Mumbai a overall good place"
Whenever I visit to the angrezi I found positive vibes. Thanks to bartender for fire tower and flaming shots too. One of the best place in navimumbai I would say.
Lovely place to hangout with friends and family. I went there for very first time enjoyed lot it was a Ladies night Wednesday. Food was delicious basically mandarin prawns and Alisha Murgh tikka. Promt service thanks to the Angrezi team. Rocking music and nice ambience.
"10th dec, 2016: Saturday night!!!
We were luking for a place nearby and heard about it a lot, so went to try it....
The place ws ok ok... the place had all the local crowd which makes it not a grt a place.... the prices of the food items were bomb!! The prices according to the place were vry high... the dance floor was conjusted... the service ws gud.. the food ws not dat great... overall i did not like the place....
M sure i wont visit d place again..
Na√Ωyyyyyyyy!!!!!"
No one listen to you here ......if u want to dance on some different song they will call bouncer.......no one is there to listen to you.....even we requested to manager to play some punjabi for 15 minutes but he didnt listened
Amazing ambience.. Great food.. Music was very good and loved the service! The food was very good and worth the wait and the taste was amazing. Loved it... I enjoyed my birthday party here.. Good for gathering.. Very spacious
"Comfortable to sit, spacious place pan fried chicken is nice, you have peanuts for pocket friendly chakhna. Dj is on always. Less crowded but there is no fun without crowd"
"Me and my girls decided to explore this pub together. Ambience is good, food is also great.Must try the chicken threads. Music is pathetic. DJ plays all old songs and even if you pass on a request it would be played only for 2 seconds which a huge put off. Even after ordering drinks in happy hours the bill was way too much. As the name suggests maybe they assume you to be from a foreign country to actually fall for these rates.Definitely over priced !!"
"I have visited for first time, it is a very good place to hangout with friends. Awesome food quality and excellent service. Now it's become my favorite place. Specifically thanks to the management. Keep it up...........!!!!"
"The worst service i have ever experience, I was promised the starter will be served till the end but it wasn't many thing were promised but noting was done.

When it came to billing I was shocked to see that the amount that i have already paid, I still need to pay the same amount again, I was said by the Manager that I cannot leave the place with out the full payment(he was totally rude) on inquiring about the same I was said that extra plates were required, but I was not consulted about the same, menu was changed with out any discussion.

All and all a bad decision made for once in a life time event, would not recommend and would never go back to that place.

TOTALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
THE ANGREZI PUB IS THE BEST PUB IN NAVI MUMBAI TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS I DO VISIT OFTEN AT D ANGREZI AND IT IS ONE OF MA FAV PLACE TO VISITI & I KNOW SOME OF THE STAFF OVER THEIR AND DEY ARE VERY KIND HEARTED SERVICE N FOOD IS VERY GOOD NO DOUBT ABOUT IT PAST FEW DAYS SOME PEOPLE ARE GIVING NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABT THE PUB BUT WHENEVER I VISIT D PUB I NEVER FEEL ISOLATED BEST PUB BEST MUSIC BEST SERVICE ANGREZI ROCK KEEP IT UP

"Angrezi pub is the best place to hangout with your family and friends. Past few days some people are intentionally portraing negative reviews about angrezi pub. I my self is big fan of angrezi pub and yes i do visit often, even few of the staff i knw are very good and kind hearted. They treat each and every one like privileged customer. I never feel isolated even wen i am alone @ the pub. They are the best pub in navi mumbai and you are safe @ Angrezi Pub. #bestpub #goodstaff #greatfood #great ambience #positivevibes #alwaysbest #bestmusic"
"Came across this on facebook i had to post this here

Saurabh Sutar AKA Dj Sau use to work at lounge called The Angrezi Pub (CBD) as Junior Inhouse Dj.

Recently a day before yesterday i came to know that we as a DJ don't have a respect were we work or give our full efforts to make people dance & entertain as they come to lounge. As a staff for a lounge we the Dj's also play a important role as a part of our job, which we do as per our caliber. This recent incident made me feel like we are nowere important or been counted by management running lounge.

This thursday i on my console was happy high playing my tunes to make people dance & groove. All happy faces around me what i was seeing....read more"
"Finally the long due visit was done yesterday to this place.
Since it was weekday the place was not much crowded. The music was loud and nice. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and chapata chicken tikka both were nice and spicy as we asked them to suggest spicy options.
We also smoked BBQ Chicken Pizza which was really yummy. Overall it was a nice experience at Angrezi Pub. The staff was also courteous and service was quick."
If you are looking for a place to drink and dance with friends in Navi Mumbai then Angrezi Plub is the place to go ... awesome ambience ... good music ... food is ok .... do visit to have crazy dancing night ....
Their staff in very rude and don't know wht their manager Sudhakar thinks of himself. They act like they don't need business. Worst place in Navi Mumbai. I would like to speak to the management if I get any number.
"A good pub in Navi Mumbai. Lovely ambience. Food and the service is good here. Also has ya pool table.
The dance floor is a bit small but the place is big. Crowd comes in mainly after 9:30."
"This place is good if you want to party party in Navi Mumbai. The music is as per the night/theme set, even otherwise it's good. Don't expect variety on foods. The service is good. Also, had been to their NY 2016 bash, even with the place being crowded - it was properly managed! Good experience overall!!"
"07.10.16. 845 pm
Good ambience..place is big by normal standards of pub., though the dance floor is a little cramped. Guess the mgmt shud remove 2 tables near the screen. Good , loud music . Theme songs to run only after 1030 pm..we went for ""Bollywood nites""..till that time english songs are belted out. Crowd trickled in by around 10.
Food ..yeah : Mongolian spicy ckhn was juicy and succulent. Rarely had such big ones. Smoked barbeque pizza on the pan was very rich in chkn. Both were good grabs in-between the dance routines. Orange delight mocktail was rich too..with the mint flavour kicking in after the 5th sip....
Overall a good experience . Recommended for special...read more"
"Had been here on a saturday night... shld say good crowd and good atmosphere for party people...
Drinks and food were well served. I would like the management to improve the food quality a bit.. i dont say it was not good but can be better taste wise..
Secondly the cooling system is very average which is not correct i suppose..
But surely a must visit place..."
Great place to hangout with friends who love to dance..good ambience n great music.. Good starters..ordered the murg malai tikka and fish patty. Fish was spicy so ask them to make it less spicy. Chicken was just too good. Loved the place overall
The most pathetic experience i have ever had zomato guys please make a note and help me lodge a case in consumer court if possible this is the first club i have been into that doesn't have a cctv camera of who enters and who leaves how is this possible?

"It is one of the most pathetic pub I have ever been to . Listen the case , when I entered they 2000 rs as cover charges . When we were about to leave we realised that we have paid bill of 12000 but forgot to settle 2000 rs . So I asked them to take their cards back and settle our 2000 rs . To which this joker manger 'Sudhkar ' said that we are closed now and we will not return Any money . After a lot of argument he said that at the best we can offer you some 250 ml Bacardi rum that you can take with you but no money at all . So next time to think to put a foot in angreji pub , think 100 times ."
"Ambience is great, music gives you the feel that you look for in a pub. Food menu doesn't offer much varieties, you have to settle with snacks kinda stuff, do not expect hard food. Taxes are high, lets see if they get in budget after DST."
"Visit Day Date n Time:- Saturday 23-Jul-16, 9.30pm.

The Angrezi Pub located in sector 11 of CBD-Belapur is one of the popular party place among local residents.

The ambience of the place compliments the good music and service too

Variety of options on the food and drinks menu. We ordered Beer, Tandoori Malai Brocolli, Murg Malai Tikka.

Both starters were perfectly cooked and marinated specially the chicken. Just loved the Murg Malai Tikka.

Recommend :- Murg Malai Tikka.

Disappointment :- Place was quiet empty (Jus two tables occupied) till 10.45pm the time we left.

Overall was good experince.

#rohanvsfood"
Worst place waste of money and time not good staff food is good I hate this place because staff have to much of attitude like who care and can't talk properly to
Food is too expensive compared to the quality. Staff behavior is not at all acceptable. And food is not at all gud as compared to other lounge in belapur. Overall a place to be avoided.
"Firstly Admire the ambiance and music, the DJ is really good skills and taste... Some how manages to keep the dance floor busy during the evening times... Secondly the bouncers are really tough looking but really helpful and supportive until and unless you are in your limits... As you all know C.B.D being a pub zone the people are attracted to this areas and so mostly the pub is crowded with amazing people... Have good parking space as well just side the road so no issues of parking as well... Food is decent and you will definitely enjoy with your company... Amazing place to visit and party hard..."
