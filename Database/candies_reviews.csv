Review
"This Bandra caf√© is beloved for its diverse menu, offering everything from salads to pastries. The casual setting and freshly baked goods make it a go-to spot for many."
""
we went to this iconic cafe in bandra after hearing a lot about it. food prices are fine but taste was okay okay. some things were good some weren't. and the ambience is nice. colorful. and give a nice old school vibe with modern touch
"This place looks like a fairy tail in the night. The lot of lighting and limited food options, it avoids the confusion of what to choose, and what not but the ambience took my heart away. I‚Äôm definitely going to visit this place again."
"Good place to hangout with friends. Loved the vibe üòç
Food was okay"
This is a must try place in Bandra. The prices are decent not too high or cheap and the food is good. Do try their cute lil desserts they are sooo cute and delicious!!!

"One of the worst cafe experiences in mumbai. There is unnecessary hassle in ordering with a three tier system of placing the order ,then paying bill at subsequent counter and further recieving the order at last counter. The menu is large but most of the wished items are not available, the staff is non respondent and non cooperative. The tables are not cleaned even after repetitive requests they don't take away the plates away. Food is average, hygiene is pathetic, service worst ; overall experience: Below average."
Pathetic service. Overhyped. To place an order they took around 15 minutes. They told us sandwiches will take 20 to 30 minutes. We agreed. Then after 40 minutes they tell us please take a refund it will take more time. Cupcake was dry. Garlic bread finger was chewy and cold. And all of this in the morning at 11. How?
We have been hanging out at Candies from college days. It used to value for money. The ambience is unchanged but the prices are really steep now. Honestly opinion it's too over priced for the quality they serve
"Not up to the mark, ok for just a one time try.
Food taste is ordinary.
Veg items were much better and exceeded expectations."
"Recently visited this place after 3 long years. This was my go-to place during college times and visiting it after 3 years felt nostalgic.

You can chill here as much as you want. It's a bungalow which was later converted into a cafe it's a 3 storey with a terrace seating.

The bakery items are too good. You have a variety of options both for veg and non-veg.

You can try :

Bebinca 5/5 - Goan desert.
Chicken sandwich 5/5 - Must try and my favourite
Tomato cheese sandwich 5/5
New York cheesecake - 4/5
Lasagna - 4/5
Paneer roll - 5/5
Pizza - 4/5

A must visit place to hangout with your friends and loved ones."

"Perfectly magical & aesthetic place. Post visit, I was mesmerized by its ambiance. Popular busy cafe with beautiful decor. Super photogenic with good food cafe (self-service). The choice of colours, the artwork on the walls, the tiny details makes the cafe quite fancy & an engaging space, which attracts the youth most. This place gives you cozy n vibrant vibes, best to hangout, chilling or date. Must visit once. ü§©üëç"
"Pathetic service, Unhygienic, didn't clean the tables even after telling them multiple times, most of the food items weren't available and we were left with very limited options. They have very less staff for such huge area."
Place provides Instagram worthy ambience but the food quality and taste is not so good as much as I expected it to be according to the hype
"The food quality was pathetic, we got food poisoning and fever after eating here.. earlier also we heard our friends saying the food has gone bad and they serve stale food and hygiene level is very poor. Highly recommend not to eat at candies ever!"
"This Cafe has such an amazing vibe it's so spacious, vibrant and with aesthetic interiors. Very photogenic cafe. Loved it
They have self service system.
Must visit once.
Chicken Jungli Croissant Sandwich
Mutton Puff
Chicken cheese lollypop
Mutton chop
Cappuccino"
"Definately palo vibess here. Visiting here was a great experience as they have huge sitting area with beautiful cozy ambiance. This place has self service system but staff here are very cooperative in all ways. You can chill hangout click pictures at different spots, read books and eat all the crazy items. Food here is just delicious. We ordered pizza, coffee, soft drink and bun it was just worth the money. We really enjoyed here."
I really like how variety of options u get . Nice ambience huge place photogenic Good as per taste . Lil pricey for a student

"Candies, this place has such a wonderful vibe I just can't explain, it is very different from other cafes, the beautiful aesthetic interiors, spacious, music, food.
We ordered Roast Chicken Sandwich which was quite tasty, complimentary potato chips were just so damn crispy and tasty too. Potato wedges was not good at all, they should try to do something to enhance the taste. Bombay Blue Mojito was tasty like a normal Mojito. The only thing I would like to share as a feedback being a customer that they should work more on the taste of the food, I mean just a little bit. Their staff is very polite and they have a quick service.
And apart from that it's a best place to go with your partner...read more"

"Understaffed, and terrible service. The food is overpriced. They were playing tiktok videos on the big screen not great ambience."
"When in Bandra, add this place to your visit list!

We tried:
1. Multigrain chicken Sandwich ‚Çπ60 5/5 Must try
2. Chicken tikka roll ‚Çπ150 4/5
3. Mini mutton samosa ‚Çπ7 5/5 MUST TRY
4. Brown bread chicken sandwich 3/5 ‚Çπ50
5. Peach iced tea 1/5 ‚Çπ150
6. Pineapple upside down cake 4/5 ‚Çπ150
7. Mini gourmandise 1/5 ‚Çπ50

Not many food options for vegetarians but a vast menu available for non vegetarians. Visit before 4pm so don't miss main items. Affordable prices.
Self service.
This place has huge place with multiple floors available for seating. A great place for a cheap yet romantic date where you can sit with a cup of coffee for hours without anyone bothering you.

"Awesome comfy place with great food. The ambience is amazing !
So vibrant and cool color theme , interiors amazing !! Would definitely visit again!"
"There are serious hygiene issues here. The place is severely under-staffed and your leftover plates get licked clean by cats and crows before a waiter clears them. To imagine that the same plates get washed (hopefully well) and used to serve you your food is a bit sickening. Also, what once used to be a VFM place has now lost the value quotient as well. I wouldn't return here, nor would I recommend anyone, especially with family to visit this place."
"Ambience is really good, but pathetic service..
I ordered cheese lollipop for take away and they dint even give a sauce along.
U r charging 60 per piece and no sauce. on that dey made me wait for the lemonade which was all ready n in front."
"The 2 star rating is only because of the staff behavior, the lady at the cash counter was extremely rude and negligent, initially she didn't even take orders and later when asked for the drinks suggestions she replied with ""everything is written there on the menu"".

The food and ambiance was absolutely gorgeous.

We tried the peach ice tea and the wildberry ice tea both are refreshing and the best coolers for thus Mumbai summer .
The blueberry cheesecake was moist, perfectly sweet.
It's a perfect place for a evening snack and desserts."
"Mr. Rajesh needs to realise how pathetic he is towards his customers. He is not at all professional and needs to be fired! Awful service and behaviour!
NOT WORTH VISITING EVEN ONCE!!"
It's a good vibrant place to hangout with your loved once. the place is well decorated with good music & vibes .We had mango & strawberry smoothie. Flavour was nice üëç
"Honest Candies Reviews!!!
Visited with my friends last Saturday. Had high hopes since I see influencers boosting and praising this place but was very disappointed.

The items we ordered were:
1. Mutton mince roll(150rs.):
It was good but nothing special about it.

2. American Club sandwitch(150rs.):
It was not really a club sandwich to begin with just a normal sandwich with chicken and mayo

3. Chicken tikka roti(150rs.)
Chicken tikka roti was good, quantity could be more compared to it's price.

4. Potato mutton chop(60rs.):
It would have tasted a lot better if potato mutton patty was freshly fried and not just given out microwaved when ordered.(rest other items where also served...read more"

"Had a rather bad experience here, went for my birthday with my friends and most of the vegetarian food was out of stock, was a task to find seating even in the afternoon time and cats were roaming around casually and eating food from the tablesü•≤ the service was quite slow and the hygiene levels were also below par. Just the ambience is pretty otherwise a meh experience"
"I went to this place for the first time and maybe that‚Äôs why loved it so much. It gave me Greece vibes with its blue walls and stone art. Liked the coffee too. Although the waiting time was crazy long, the billing process happened through three people and the food was obviously not fresh."
"Great ambience.
Food was not worth the price.
Service was alright.
The worst thing about this place is the smell. The whole open area smells terrible (like a fish market). There were cats and crows all around and were eating all the food from our table.
It is great for pictures as this place is huge and has an aesthetic vibe.
FOOD:
1. Chicken Lasagna: 3/5
2. Dragon chicken: 4/5
3. Stuffed Chocolate donut: 1/5
4. Dark cherry cheesecake:4/5
(Slush was not available)"

"I had a great time at Candies, Pali. Must have stuffed Chicken, fish fillet.
The deserts are not very appealing, try and skip the brownies and macaroons.
The mojito is a must have.
Pro tip - if you are with a group of friends, split in groups of folks that will stand in the queue to place the order, pick up the order and hold a place. This eatery gets very crowded especially frequented by youngsters, hence grabbing a place to sit becomes cumbersome."
Hype üò£ This place is too huge and We we went around 6:00 pm so crowded with people. Took 40 mnts to order food. Non veg menu is too huge but veg options are too less. Hardly 1 item in each section is veg. Everything is already cooked so they will just preheat and give you to eat. Open kitchen but highly Unhygienic. Staff is so slow in service. Good part in staff is they have kept handicap people. They are so helpful. One star is only for those people. Otherwise there is nothing good about this place. Worthless/ Unhygienic/crowded/frozen/unhealthy food is served.
"I was really carried away by the amazing review and the hype created by soo many videos created around this place.
In reality the place is a bit expensive -and a really bad option for vegetarian eaters.
To continue with it‚Äôs filled with college students gathering just to click pictures
Further the open are is annoying as it‚Äôs not clean, often leaves fall off
You can work in peace not eat as you are conscious if some small insect or leaves might fall on your food or laptop
The AC section is too small to accommodate the crowd
I ordered a 1/4 sandwich (a piece) and a lemonade, total cost of ‚Çπ250
They served a bit low grade paper glass which started to loose shape after 10 min...read more"
"More than half the things aren't available on their menu even in the evening which is disappointing. Hope they also had more options for vegetarians. The ordering process is a task and time consuming as well. The place is quite huge and there are multiple seating options which is what I liked. Helps in social distancing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ
I hope they do improve their menu and service though.

"Food - Hardly anything on the menu was available ( at Sunday night 8 pm, they ran out of items). Slightly overpriced, and taste was mediocre.
Staff - disrespectful, rude and impolite behaviour, they had no interest in customers.
Ambience - the only positive."
"Loud, obnoxious music blared endlessly throughout our time there. The management wouldn't turn it off even after requesting multiple times. People with migraines stay away. Food was average (NEVER touch the chicken pot pie). 5/10"

The cafe is very spacious and the interior of the cafe is delightful. Great place for dates. The food is a little overpriced but i surely recommend this place. Try it atleast once!

"Always wanted to visit, this place has another hyper and it is always crowded. The food is really nice. Most of the items on menu are never available. The service is slow there is a lot waiting to place order. Other things ambience is good worth a visit."
"In 1 world it's wow place such a lovely atmosphere and look I just loved it the place and sitting arrangement is awesome. It is really pocket friendly and quality of the food is really really good. You can spend whole days here without any disturbance.
5/5 star for place
4/5 star for food & drinks"

"I visited the place as I heard so much but as soon as I entered there were more than 3-4 big sized mice coming down from the staircase ! I looked at the guard and the staff standing there , but to my amusement- they directed these mice towards the bakery that was almost getting sold out and people didn‚Äôt care about the hygiene or the fact that these creatures were in the kitchen as well ."
"Self-service from very limited menu options. Ordering process feels more like a Cake Shop with three steps - Order, Pay and Collect, each with its own queue.

Crowded, in-spite of the above mentioned pain points tells you people love Candies for it's ambience (Large property than most restaurants in Mumbai), food and desserts.

Try out the Croissant Club sandwiches, Cheesecakes, Russian cakes, jelly slices and freshly baked Pizzas!"
I once loved the Club sandwhich here. Came after a long time to visit and dig into the yummies. What dissapointment! The sandwhich was tasteless and sloppy. Did the food standards go down? Or it's just that I visited candies at the wrong time?
Ambience wise it's a super cool place to hangout with friends but the quantity of food is not upto the price as well as taste. Genuinely liked the ambience but not the food.
"The perfect hangout place if you are catching up with someone or even if you want to just eat alone and watch a movie. Candies has a corner for every mood of yours. Their food is worth the price they charge, nothing fancy but still tasty. Their ambience ofcourse is very cozy and welcoming. This is one of my favourite places in the city to spend some quite time."
""
"Candies is a good place for non-vegetarians as it offers a wide variety of non-vegetarian foods. on the other hand, there is less variety in vegetarian food items.
‚Ä¢ The environment is beautiful, aesthetic, pleasing to the mind, and ideal for clicking images for social media.
‚Ä¢ the taste was good but it wasn't that hot because of the delay in serving
‚Ä¢ the most frustrating thing was the waiting time.
‚Ä¢ If you are a sandwich lover you will not be disappointed as this place is known for its sandwiches. My personal favorite is the croissant sandwich.
‚Ä¢ You should try the New York style cheesecake, it's well worth the price, although it's a bit expensive.

I had been to candies with my bestfriends and it‚Äôs an amazing cafe located in Bandra ! The ambience is extremely unique and attractive. They have indoor and outdoor seating which is very pretty. The interior is very cool and classy . The have many option in dessert. I love their cheese cake and tiramisu. Their pizza and croissants are also amazing ! It is a must visit cafe as it is totally worth it ! The quality of the food that they serve is just perfect.

Absolutely a fan of onion rings here! And the shales have no competition! Candies is like a high school crush that you can never get over with! A must visit!

Very nice ambient. Food is good and value for money they have plenty of sitting arrangements and you can spend a lot of time.
"Candies.. a gem of Bandra and Mumbai too.. a cafe where many love stories would have been made by now. Beautiful ambience, vast space, classy lights...completely instagramabble.
Taste is good.. quality is nice too. Expect good crowd too. Only let down is s bit extended waiting time for your order. But a definite visit must place. - Aee kHalo aka Foodiliciousmit:)"
Definitely going to place this again. They have a great range of Veg and Non Veg but it's self service. They have even special discount on food after 8.So please visit after night curfew to available this amazing offer.
"Rooftop Seating, Awesome Location, Calming Ambiance
Macaroni Salad, , Croissants, Blueberry cheesecake, Chutney Sandwich, Cold Coffee, Chocolate ganache , Cupcakes .
Ambiance :5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Service:4.5/5"
"The place is huge but it‚Äôs dirty. The service is terrible. It takes forever for you to place the first order and more than forever to collect your order. And not really worth the money at all! We ordered a chocolate milkshake, and trust me it tasted like melted vanilla ice cream!"

"I understand candies being one of the top most rated and Instagrammable places in Bandra the waiting time it took to get just a pair of chicken lollypop and veg noodles was eternity.
What frustrates me the most is though my noodles were ready right infront of me I had to wait another 15mins to get two pieces of chicken lollypop which were already ready they just had to reheat it.
Also the place is not clean untidy chairs and tables.
Really a bad experience. Go here only if you are looking for some instagram stories."
The ambience of the cafe is amazing but the price of veg burger or some pastries is not appreciated. The potato mutton chop was good with muffins.
"The cafe is such a pretty place to hang around, do work. Also the place is so aesthetically pleasing. You can sit in one corner and no one's gonna disturb you. The only thing I didn't like was unavailability of few food items which I was looking forward to try out and henceforth I had to select from the options that were available.
1) Spaghetti (3.5/5)- It was pretty good but I have had better. The flavor was amazing, perfect amount of cheesy and creamy
2) Chicken Croissant sandwichü•ê(5/5)- I really enjoyed the sandwich and the place is known for its sandwiches. If you are a sandwich lover, do visit this place and try out their sandwiches. They are really amazing and will fill your...read more"

"This place is located in the heart of bandra that is pali hill and it is one of the oldest cafe in Mumbai
The ambiance is really Good and photography friendly.
However more than half of the things in the menu was not available also I found the ordering process a bit confusing. I ordered chinese combo (Fried Rice & Paneer starter) I didn't liked it didn't tasted like chinese they used small grain Rice which was a turn off, next was Falefal wrap üåØ it was good, veg puff was okayish, Carmel custurd was decent and the mojito was just wowww like this is the only thing I would urge you to try at Candies. My experience here was good in terms of the vibe of the place the food is average"

"Candies is a good place for non vegetarians as it offers a great variety of food over vegetarian options.

Service - 3/5
People have to wait in a queue to place their order and wait again for some more time for the payment and receive their order. People management should be looked upon.

Ambience - 3.5/5
Must visit place for some instaworthy pictures :)

Food - 3.5/5 - Cheese junglee sandwich

The sandwich had a good amount of cheese. But was a bit mealy. Could've been better

Chinese combo - 3.5/5
The taste was good but by
the time we received this order it wasn't hot enough.

Overall experience - 3/5"
"may be one of the extremely few people giving such a low score for one of the most renowned eateries in Bandra. We reached for a brunch and by the time we got the food and a place to rest our backs, it was well into lunch time. Add to that extreme exhaustion due to heat and sweat.
The concept of taking order at one counter where the guy will prepare your tray and then you go to another counter for payment and then a third counter to actually collect your food, completely beats me.
Candies pl come up with a better scheme of management.. It'll save more than an hour for customers per visit...
Posting some pics of the lovely place (yes the ambience is definitely awesome)..."
"Just with words you cannot describe this place. You can call it friends adda or food heaven this place will blow your mind, not just with its delicious food but also with its elegant interior.

From lip smacking snacks to sipping your hot brew coffee or gulping down some delicious meal along with some refreshments this places got everything under one roof and under one menu.

CANDIESSS.........this place is amazing, had gone along with my friends and it's elegant interior caught my attention with those beautiful lamps hanging on the roof. Thought you can only enjoy this places if the food counter has food displayed, coz you can only order food depending on the availability.
