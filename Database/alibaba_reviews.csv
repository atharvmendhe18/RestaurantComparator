Review
"I have been here twice and both the times I've been suprised by the food quality. It's just too good. They have amazing soups, one should surely try their chicken lemon grass soup . The chicken fortune rice is my personal favourite, it's light and tasteful. The seafood and barbeques are also good. The place is pretty looking. I went on the new year's Eve and my experience was really good. I did not have a booking but the owner played the perfect host. They not only made sure we have a table but also personally came down to ask if we needed anything else. Great service."
"Superb ambience at this place. Loved the soup , starters and kadai paneer. Also the handi biryani is well cooked and very tasty. One of the places to try out close to gateway of india and typical SOBO hifi place. The place is exquisite and once in a while one should splurge...."
"Very nice place,don't know why it has such a bad rating. Ambience is nice and classy, food is good, Butter naan is absolutely perfect. Mutton Handi is good so is takatak is also nice. washroom is not that good but they are at least trying. All in all a nice place. They oldworldy classic jazz and rock roll instrumentals."
The washroom is the dirtiest you will see in any towny place .. food was alright ..the place could do better in terms of service.. average average !!
"Alibaba is an old world fine dine place....its actually 50 years old.Classic decor... hand embroidered 20 ft long wall hanging...ceiling painted with border motif...rough stone with inlay around the concealed ceiling lights ...original parquet floor etc etc
Food is very good...limited classic items...good ole Indian BBQ and Oriental . ...which is not an after thought...has always been there. I was dismayed to see the Zomato ratings...I can only imagine it's bcos the owners are perhaps older than the restaurant and unaware of modern day marketing! Worth a visit ...still!"
Great place to eat..pretty close to gateway of India..do pay a visit when you happy to be around this place..had a good brunch at this place
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!
"" DON'T ALWAYS TRUST WHAT YOU SEE, EVEN SALT LOOKS LIKE SUGAR "" is what reminds me of this place!!!
So we visited to this place having a fancy door thinking it would be a good one...
Just two families inside....still the service was slow...
Forget about the average tasting pricey food....
THE BILL WAS OVER-PRICED BY 500 BUCKS....And had to call the manager to get it verified!!!
#CheckTheBill
Wouldn't Recommend To ANYONE  At All...!!!!"
"Ha..we were looking for a place to dine in on friday night and found this!.. Sucha savior to have room for us to dine in on friday night!

Interiors are cool and comfy place! I felt i was dining home..it gave me that feel.

Coming to food- root out salads, did not enjoy them here. Loved soup, and food was good.. Dal khichdi dint give me that taste i was looking for.

Overall good enough experience"
"Loved the food, the service and the location. The Biryani was redolent with the right amount of spices. The decor and ambience are quite comfortable"
"Celebrated our Ali's bdday at Alibaba...Quite a decent place to have a sumptuous dinner - Its located adjacent to a Bentley Showroom. On the left, you can see the Gateway of India and the Taj hotel high rise is visible bang in front...can't ask for more...the interiors have been designed in the typical 80's fashion with the roof way above you, the bar stocked up nicely at one end, bollywood instrumental playing thru the JBL and the typical roasted tandoori smell from the kebabs and biryani...had a wonderful time...the food was great and so was the occasion !"
"Had dinner here recently. The service was good, the interior is nice and the food was enjoyable. Really enjoyed the paneer and dessert.

My only problem was the washroom. Completely filthy, floor was wet, it smelt bad and worst of all, the toilets wouldn't flush. So unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber."
Great place!! Food was tasty well flavoured.. The pot rice I found not up to the expectations of taste that staters had... Over all it was a great place and would love to visit again for the sea-food..
"I am Really surprised at the rating of this place .. 2.6 
Nice place , ambience good  , has two sections ground and the magazine.
Service is ok .... But somehow this place is not a crowd puller.
Something is Missing .....

Tomato Dhaniya Shorba - good.
Paneer Dohra kabab - should try its nice and so is the Chilly Paneer ( Basically the Paneer dishes whatever we tried were good)
Skip The Dimsims
Bhindi Kurkure in Veg was ok ....
Kung Pao Potato and Spring Rolls were ok+ 
skipped the mains ...

Such a great Location ... hmm
Priced a bit high I feel.

Go at your own risk .....if you happen to visit stick to the Kebabs."
"Surprisingly there was no one except us inside on a Sunday evening.
Already sceptical about we stuck to soups starters and one fried rice with Hunan chicken. The soups were fine and did justice. Starters could have been better- Mongolian chicken was dry and the tikka platter had over done chicken. If you specialise in BBQ then you should have your kababs moist and well cooked right ? Overall average performance"
"I saw the reviews and rating on Zomato only after my friend and I had already taken a seat in the restaurant. We ordered a soup a fish starter and drinks. By the time we were done tasting all three, I felt that the restaurant was sightly underrated. But once the main course came in..I realised that the food was not really worth it. They have interesting names for some dishes like the taka tak chicken..but the taste is pretty much boring. Nothing new about it."
"So I was here with my family for a small party... Even though I liked the Barbeque items like Veg Corn Seekh Kebab... Paneer pattice... Sauteed mushrooms salad... Chicken Tangdi Kebab... Chicken tikka... Snack rounds went on for 2 and half hours(8 PM to 10:30 PM)... Then came the main course which was a huge let down... I would not want to recommend this place for Main Course Items... Yes you can try their drinks... They have a good range for liquor.... You can get any Straight Drink you want especially in a party... The restaurant owner and staff were courteous and polite... The per head cost for food was Rs.675 (Decent as it includes starters, soup, main course and desert)"
"This place has existed since eons, but I happened to visit Alibaba for the first time only in October 2015. I found the food to be strictly okay, palatable, it's your basic India, Chinese and Mughlai kind of fare. The Hakka noodles was stale and the chicken undercooked. What we did enjoy was the Chinese appetizer dim sums Chicken Sui Mai - it was way beyond average size and filling was quite good. This is a very pricey place and the cuisine and taste doesn't justify the prices."
"Great location and great tandoori platter was the only thing for which I would go often.
Ambience, slow service and bad tasteless main course is of a concern.
It can be revamped and needs a change..."
It used to be a good place for biryanis and kebabs and i still feel it has a potential to be a star once again they just need to revamp themselves. I use to be their fan for biryani and i still visit them no matter what i like this place.
Amazing food. Tried fish fingers and hyderabadi chicken biryani both were yummy. Prompt service and soothing music. Staff was friendly and helpful in recommending dishes for confused ones like me.
"This restaurant is my all time favourite! The steamed fish, the delicious kebabs, the best dals. They always fulfil my cravings .I would recommend it!!"
Food is amazing! A taste that your tongue will never forget and will wish to visit the plane again and again! A perfect fm silt place! Price is quite reasonable give the Taste and quantity! Most of the mocktails are delicious as well! One may try all of them!
"Excellent food
I eat there dinner very nice tasty superb great I like ali baba
Fish chicken great but more excellent sea food Kalim chicken kalimirch chicken or fish kadia great"
"Great food,Awesome service.Must go there.We ordered one sizzling brownie there,Oh man what a taste,I can't describe it was so tasty.I am coming again!!!!!!!"
"Confused about what it is. Though it does writes sea food and BBQ but menu is major northern. Kababs are OK and so is the mains, avoid biryani. Food needs improvement. Nice ambience."
"Whatever we ate there was tasty, I yet find something to be missing. I'm not sure what it is. Guess il have to visit again to find out. Beware!"
The location of restaurant is very good..ambience is also very calm..but when it comes to food it was ok.. Starter was good but main course was not at all up to the mark..not value for money..
"I guess I fell for the generous serving part of it. I asked for home delivery of Butter Chicken, 2 Roomali Roti and Nawabi Mutton Biryani. It started with them asking me one way taxi fare of INR60. I then had to explain that the taxi fare is not more than INR 30 and no other restaurant charges for home delivery. They relented and delivered the food in an hour.

The food was mediocre and def not worth the INR 1300 we spent. The quantity of butter chicken was just enough for 2 small servings each. The roomali roti was nothing to talk about and the Biryani- here the quantity was fantastic but taste- average. The mutton pieces were cooked very well.

All in all, an average overpriced joint...read more"
"The restaurant has great location(literally next to gateway of India) is a nice place for Indian Mughlai food!!
The decor is simple and pleasing( not too much to talk about)!! They have a party enclosure in their mezzanine floor which is also nice n roomy(doesn't feel cramped inspite of it being mezzanine).
However the Food does all the talking!!!!

The kebabs - stuffed aloo, tandoori gobhi, stuffed mushrooms are mouth melting!! Very very well marinated and moist to eat.
The stuffed kulcha is also very well done.
The servings are fairly generous. The staff is very courteous and accommodating."
"One monsoon afternoon lurking around on the streets of Colaba, we were struck by sudden pangs of hunger! Almost every place near the Gateway of India was experiencing a busy lunch hour, so we went into Alibaba's. It is certainly a popular joint in that area to nosh up some well cooked seafood. Knowing the same, I had a tandoori pomfret, which was cooked to perfection. The fish was very fresh, moist and cooked to the core, marinated with spices that enriched the succulent flavours of this marine delight. My vegetarian friend had a plate of vegetable biryani which too was quite delicious although for cholesterol watchers it could come across a tad bit oilier than preferable. The menu is...read more"
"Disappointing. Seafood tag attracted us to enter.. The place was clean an we were hungry. Ordered a lot of food, two types of fish... One Chinese type n a tandoori fish tikka , dal makkhani, kadai veg, roti... All this for 2 people :-) The roti n curry were OK, the Chinese style fish was good. We had to send back the first fish tikka as it was not fish tikka.. They argued that that what it was... Took 2 out of 4 pieces back... Came back with 2 pieces of the same stuff heated up... It was full of ajwaen and the fish was stale... We paid a bill of 2200 for the aggravation."
"I went to Alibaba with my family for lunch. The place was quiet with soft music playing in the background (just the way we like it). We found the ambiance very pleasant. We started off with Crab meat soup, Seafood coriander soup, Malai Kebab and Tandoori pomfret. For main course we ordered Prawns Sichuan Pepper and Seafood Pot Rice. We finshed it off with Malai Kulfi and Litchies with Ice cream. Overall it was an amazing experience: nice and friendly service, delicious food (softest chicken i've ever tasted) and reasonably priced. Will definitely go again :)"
"We landed up in Alibaba by pure chance. It said bbq and seafood on the outside and since my friend is a seafood lover we decided to give it a try. The ambience is pleasant with sufficient seating both downstairs and on top. Low seated chairs and a kind of darbar like interior.

Now normally I would order Indian in such a restaurant but since my friend was ordering and he preferred chinese we decided to try it out. I must also mention that there was no noteworthy item in the bbq menu for a restaurant that claims to specialise kn bbq and seafood.

For starters we ordered the Calamari. Followed by chicken hakka noodles and a Fish in spicy ginger sauce for main course.
The calamari came...read more"
good ambience. ..food was nice edible tasty. ..value for money....drawbacks ....poor service.....overcharged us.....pls check the bill before leaving.....odered chicken takatak butter chicken......the crotons in tomato soup tasted like plastic......
"The location is very good, walking distance from gateway.
Good Ambiance, family types atmosphere
Nice Food"
"A not so popular Indian cuisine restaurant situated in Colaba. You might almost miss it as it hasn't got its due as have many other places in Colaba. However, the service is friendly and the food is quite good. They have quite a few unique items on their menu such as Corn Cocktail Pizza, Cheese Kaju Roll in appetizers. In the main course - one must try the Sizzling Kebab Platter, the Stuffed Parathas, the Crispy Lamb and Seafood Dumplings. Do end the meal with their famous Litchi ice cream. Super!"
I dont like cheken soap but Except that its Delicious
"If you have been to Karims in Delhi there is no need to to visit these fancy restaurants in and around Colaba. Alibaba is situated in a location to die for - A stone throwing distance from the Gateway.

Started with a Kebab platter. The burrah kabab (mutton) was dissapoting...1/5????

The chicken and fish were just above average. I recommend all the Tandoor and Kebab chefs in Mumbai (including Bade Miya) to have a crash course in Karims!!!!!

The creamy chicken soup was good rather quiet good if compared to the starters. The bread in Alibaba is definitely over priced. Rather I suggest to go for the basket. It will be economical if you are a group of 3. Coming to the side dish. Kashmiris...read more"
"Amazing food,great staff and great value for money.Excellent chinese food and the Channa Pindi is a must try."
"excellent place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, superb..........mind blowing..........try it out......then you will come to know what the good food is all about.."
"Looking for a quick bite? Then this is the place. Service is quick and the food is tasty. Value for money, the portions are sizable, and the staff helpful. The ambiance is poor and the place does look dingy when you enter but it grows on you.
If you are spending a leisurely day sightseeing at the Gateway of India then this is the place for you. Rs 1200 for two should do."
