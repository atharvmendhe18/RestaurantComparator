"it was too spicy, unable to eat.."
"I ordered from Abhinandan restaurant thinking it will b good in taste but It was from different restaurants called Sai palace, it was tasteless. All items were below average. I was unwell and thought food will help me recover. But it did exactly opposite. Very disappointing service. False Commitment"
"very pathetic service
very bad food
don't go at any cost
I won't recommend it at any cost bi it last restaurant"
Spinach wasn't cooked properly. and paneer wasn't of good quality
Avoid crispy corn. Very bad and avoidable.

"I have become the loyal customer here, just because of my favourite dish ""butter chicken"" all credit goes to the restaurant's chef.
Butter Chicken here is so flavorful & mouth-watering. The gravy is made so perfectly thick, smooth rich textured with shredded chicken into it. Super-Tasty. They call it Murgh Makkhanwala.
I searched for delicious butter chicken in Powai, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli but never satisfied me in terms of typical taste of butter chicken either it was ok-ok types or not good at all, but glad to find this one where I can enjoy the real taste of butter chicken again.
Shoutout to All Butter Chicken fans, it's a must try here atleast once."

The item is named Pot Chicken fried rice but instead what came was buttery sweet plain rice in soya sauce gravy. Could hardly eat the rice as it was too sweet for my liking. Avoidable if you're not used to it.

The packaging for the 600 rupee biryani from Abhinandan in the Sai Palace group was the worst I've ever seen. There's a need to improve food delivery by prioritizing quality packaging over cardboard boxes.

What a ridiculous attitude of staff called shyam and Sagar. ... have never experienced such an attitude in the hospitality industry. We family of 15 including elders have to step out due to their stubbornness and arrogant behaviour just for volume of the match screening in spite of the entire restaurant being empty. No courtesy to serve water also cause of this as they carried such arrogance. Shameful of being in This industry.

The chicken starters were good but the biryani was not good at all it was bland in taste.

Ordered for Gosht matka biryani which was supposed to come in a pot and for which I paid extra but it rather came in a sad paper box. Complete waste of money. Felt cheated to the core as the biryani itself tasted very mediocre. On top of it Zomato washed their hands off 3 times saying they couldn't see my images. Pathetic experience overall. Please don't order matka biryani from here....it's a farce.
