didn't know that I had to pay for bhaji separately when I order a masala dosa
"Nandu Dosa is a personal favorite of mine, and the best part is that it was conveniently located near my college. It's a charming little roadside stall, perfect for street food enthusiasts. The variety of Dosas they offer is simply fantastic, and the special chutney they serve alongside the Dosa is exceptional. I highly recommend trying their Gini Dosa and the Mysore Masala Dosa! üëåüèª"
The Manchurian in the roll was hard. the green chutney served was watery.
no salt in chutney

"Nandu's Dosa is one of the most famous street side food in Juhu Area and they have maintained the same taste of their Dosa's through so many years.

Service is quick and the person making dosa simultaneously makes so many different types of dosa at the same pan which was good to see.

We ordered for Paneer Chilly Dosa, Schezwan Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa and Plain Dosa.
I tried Paneer Chilly Dosa which is my go to dosa at this place and love it everytime I have that. Second Dosa i tried was Schezwan Masala Dosa with some extra Schezwan sauce at the side. This Dosa too was perfectly crisp and was over in less then 2minutes.

Whenever I visit Mumbai from Pune i always ensure to give atleast...read more"
Can serve sambhar as well
"I loved the idlis there were 3 fattest idlis i ever ordered in such cheap price 40 rupees for 3 idlis it's AMAZING!!!

I read previous reviews about SAMBHAR however I felt that the sambhar really tasted as home made with all the dals visible and it tasted really light and good that can be eaten with rice also.

Chutney was also tasty and Qty was really awesome

Totally loved the IDLI IN JUST 40 RUPEES FOR 3 üôÇ"
Overhyped. All dosas taste the same. Pathetic sambar.
"Absolute disaster of a dosa.

Ordered Masala Dosa, Mysore masala cheese dosa, Paneer chilli dosa and sada dosa.

All dosas were burnt.
The Masala of the masala dosa was rubbish. Not mixed well and bad taste.
The Paneer one was not Chinese not shezwan based as described by the order taker. It was sweet and watery.

Would not recommend at all."
sambhar would have been a better option
Awesome dosa
I had informed the excutive agent to tell the delivery guy to get change they didn't inform the delivery agent I faced problems
