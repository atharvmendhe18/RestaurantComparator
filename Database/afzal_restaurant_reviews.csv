"Ordered Mutton kepsa (full) & shocked to find only bones & no meat at all. Also, in the name of kepsa, they just served low grade fried rice. Upon raising all these concerns with the staff, they refused to refund or do anything about it. Instead, they were rude & arrogant to me. Absolutely hated it & will not recommend. Stay away!"
you can See In Above Image How Much Oil They Used In Rice

"Quite a place to enjoy some lip ‚Äì smacking kepsas here. I & my friend were spoilt by choices as they had humungous list of kepsas to die for. If you are planning to go here, make sure that you don‚Äôt have anything outside or anywhere because the quantity of kepsas particularly is something worth the price you will pay. They do have other dishes as well for e.g., biryani, starters and much more you will find in their menu. So, they serve both Chinese & north Indian cuisines to satiate your palate.

Food:

Special Chicken Kepsa (1/2) ‚Äì Good enough for 4-6 people to finish it fully. Portion of rice did justice along with the pieces of chicken and a bit of diced carrots &...read more"
Delay in delivery.

so expensive

Never order chicken kepsa in half quantity. Chicken kepsa full is more than enough for 5 people but half will hardly suffice for 2 people plus the cost is also way too much considering half. please order in full quantity even if you are 2 people eating
The paneer is stale and smells bad along with taste... photo attached as well.... need refund for the same
"they sent food in plastic dubba, where as they should sent in countenar"
pathetic experience with this restaurant. plus bad experience from Zomato too. the time of delivery was 28 min and they deliver the food after 55 min . pathetic experience
no taste to the food.. paneer is stale and hard
It's a good for non-veg lovers . Food quantity & quality is very good . It's famous for kepsa . Famous for variety of kepsa.
