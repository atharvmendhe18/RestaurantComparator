Review
Extremely Patel hectic food . All food gone to dustbin â€¦ really such a horrible food . All wastage of money
"I have ordered recently from here
Veg Spring roll:- Good amount of stuffing very tasty & delicious love these rolls here

Mushroom Chilli:- As per price they should increase some more quantity of mushrooms
Taste was good very flavourfull"
got hairs in the food
Needs to increase Quantity and Tadte
"Before yesterday means on 4th September 2021 dining for a fasting item you can see its Sabudana khichdi.
Now zoom and the image what I got..
Its a cockroch... Yes you heard rite its a bloody cockroch.
Still I didn't react much because there was many people having there food..
Just called the cashier show him and he is like Jane do Jane do dusra deta hu..
I was like i dont want more cockroch. I walked out..
From last 2 days I not feeling too eat anything because of that incident.."
"I have ordered dosa and vada idli
Chatni was not fresh ..
Sambhara and dosa stuffing tasteless
Not happy with quality"
"i ordered 2 plate pav bhaji that actually serve 4 people, the quantity and quality of pavbhaji was so good, we all love the taste of pav bhaji.
pav bhaji price is 110 and I ordered 2 plate so my bill was 220+ 54 tax, this means 274 was my final but Zomato give me 100 rupee off so I get my order in 174 rupee
thank you zomato"
tasteless only tomato gravy no vegetables money waste would not recommend
Very oily and very spicy veg kadai even after providing instructions for less oily and less Spicy. Alankar takes longer time to accept the order which causes delay in delivery. Alankar should minimize there time in accepting the orders.
"Very bad food. They serve stale
food by heating it and the oil they use tastes really bad. I ordered Rawa masala dosa..and it was full of only beetroot and the it was like the dosa paper doesn't even exist. My friend ordered Paper masala dosa and the paper was so thick that it felt like a mattress."
my order is delayed 1 hour. parcel service by restaurant is too late
"neither Lasoon Naan nor roti was as per standard, Naan costed 36 Rs but deserves only 15 Rs, Roti of 12 to be 05 only as per their standard of meal. need to improve the quality of food"
Paneer Butter Masala was very salty and also I ordered Orange juice but Mosambi juice delivered
"Ordered Spring dosa & crispy noodles the Spring dosa was the best I've eaten till now
the crispy noodles were just right"
"Visited at this place. This hotel located at worli. Many time i visited this place but only for Alankar special pizza. This pizza is so yummy and tasty. First time i saw On veg pizza toping they serve Cashew. The staff was nice and polite. This nice hotel. Mostly family came this hotel.

Must visit this place"

"Was in the vicinity for some work and stopped out here for a quick bite. The restaurant is very pocket friendly and the place is also hygienic. I tried only south indian dishes and ordered the  following:
Mendu Vada (4/5 just average taste)
Butter idli (4/5 ....have had better but was worth for the price )
Sada dosa ( 4/5 .... would have preferred a lot crispier )

overall its bang for your buck"

"The two best things about Alankar are its taste and its low price.. Its next to Durdarshan tower. At prime location. They serve all types of menu. Like south indian, north indian, chines and jain
*must try: dal khichdi and palak khichdi*
Taste:9/10
Price:9/10
Service:9/10
Ambience:8/10"
"I was having some hunger issues and spotted this restaurant on my way. Its not even a decent restaurant. I tried out their medu vada which was below average in taste
Also tried out their Paneer kadhai which was not even paneer kadhai. It was quite decent in taste but didn't even tasted a bit like paneer kadhai. This restaurant needs a lot of improvement in their quality and tastewise as well"
"Alankar refreshments is located in worli near Doordarshan. The place is crowded since it is located near office places. The staff has maintained the hotel very well and they are polite as well as friendly. Our food service was very quick. You can order veg as you will receive a lot of varieties. South Indian is their speciality
We ordered the following:-
Medu Vada/Idli
Cheese Mysore masala dosa
Pavbhaji
Butter naan
Panner do pyaaz(best paneer dish i have eaten till now)"

"Alankar seriously needs to improve their taste especially in a competitive place like Worli. Be it Punjabi or Pav Bhaji, didn't find anything interesting."
Best in hotel in worli for vegitrains. Nice place.. Staff is good..quick services...I like the dosa most...best in tastee.ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹. Must vist the place once...worlikar
"The best part about this restaurant is that it serves you healthy south Indian breakfast with a twist. You have the opportunity to enjoy various dishes that you may not expect to have as a meal. Another good thing about this place is their use of ghee for preparation of food. My personal favourite at this place was the 'Masala Toast'. I would suggest everyone to give it a try. Also be prepared to wait for 5-10 minutes during weekends.

The food out there is average.

Not that great but there is value for money.

Service is not very quick.

It's a perfect place for a quick lunch or breakfast."
It's all FAKE..... Alankar main cashier told they are not enrolled with ZOMATO.... and denied any services.. He totally denied and told ZOMATO plp are cheater and put the hotel's name by themself...
"Effective and economical. Typical udipi style restaurant with North Indian & Chinese fare thrown in. Service is fast. The sambar is of the orange variety which I personally don't like but the dosas are good - the rava dosa in particular. In North Indian food, daal is good, paneer dishes are average. Tandoori rotis are nice and cheap.
Haven't tried the Chinese food here.
All in all a good place to grab a quick inexpensive meal."
Worst quality food delivered ....Malai koftas gravy was too sweet than anywhere....Only sweetness in gravy not up to the mark.... provide at least average qality and also order confirmation was not up to time
The taste of pav bhaji was good but the quantity is very less
bad bad very bad..
"We order masala dhosa, jira rice , yellow dal , channa masala , tandoori roti , food was nice & quick service overall good experience ...thank u see u soon .."
Worst taste of pav bhaji it doesnt taste like pav bhaji only. Next thing is paneer tikka biryani it doesnt had tikka flavour only. It was like masala bhat
"This place is very old but the taste is good
This place is famous for south indian food
I have tried masala dosa and their are varieties of chatnis..
Their service is also good
Their ambience is also nice"
"Alankar is a vegetarian restaurant located in the heart of Worli. It serves South Indian, North indian and other quick bites.
We have tried the Pav Bhaji, Masala Pav and the Cheese Tawa Pulav over here.
I much say that this was the best Masala Pav I have had.
The Pav Bhaji was also good and the Tawa Pulav was full of flavor."
delivered at the wrong address despite giving them full address.
"The masala dosa was not good . Sometimes itâ€™s very tasty but the last time was so bad . Please upgrade the quality. Sometimes it is very tasty. And please if someone call , be polite. Donâ€™t just be ha bolo kya chaiye ."
Improper packing
good taste
this time it was on time
normal
"ordered dal tadka,roti and curd,curd was not at all good"
abc
The order was not as per specifications
unsatisfied with service and food is also not so hot
good
very bad experience in delivering food
food good but delivery poor.
"horrible dosas. all delivered cold and soggy.
mysore dosa has some sick red chutney. rava onion dosa had beetroot instead of onions. sambar tastes like some left over curry from the earlier night.
I would never ever recommend this restaurant even to an enemy.
they charge 20 for delivery yet the order comes in wet newspaper.
overall experience was sick. all the breakfast was thrown out and not consumed. absolutely disappointed.
I let them go once earlier too when we ordered for paneer dosa paid for extra paneer topping instead we got potato bhaji in the dosa n there was no sign of the paneer.
hopeless restaurant."
The dosa was good but the sambar was too sweet....
The guy delivered it 3 hours after the order was placed!
I ordered 2 different vegetables in menu and I got same vegetable in the two boxes . Is it ok?
delivery was late and was not warm
"Order was about an hour late and also some items was missing and even when I called the person he said that it was not in what I ordered
I request you to please don't order food from even if you are starving and this restaurant is the only option."
rice is very oily and taste less
Thank you
Too spicy for a khichdi. Didnâ€™t like it at all.
very late
Okayish
bad test I am order tikha but revived order sweet
sandwich was not toasted properly
I m not received my order on time
we ordered dosa and uttapam ...we received order without sambar and less chutney
Itâ€™s totally worth the price
Worst taste
very good
delivered half an hour late than the stipulated time.
"good food, but unnecessarily spicy"
"khichdi was good, but roasted papad and onion received as complimentary were not in eatable condition. Papad was not cruncy at all and onion was foul smelling"
Good food. Value for money.
