tandoori momo did not had gravy on the outside.. but it was good could get better
Didn’t liked it
"Mostly because of the late delvery, food was already cold and tasteless. You can understand if hot momos was packed for 45 mins, what will happen to it."

"The food was just bad, everything about it"
very bad quality and taste...worst momo chatni
ekdum faltu momos pet kharab hogaya
"Don’t buy, not as advertised and not tasty"
paneer momo were bland n steam momo were tasting like water or too overcook
The chicken achari momos were tasteless not even fried properly . even the stuffing didn't taste like chicken. .Not worth a single Penny
uncooked
""
momos are spoiled extra fried burned all
give extra chutney and Mayo 😀

good👍

I donot like the idea of mixing certain things to increase the quantity. It's like fooling your customers. Whenever you order paneer momos you will find soya granules in them. I don't order paneer momos to eat soya momos. Have some authenticity.

poor quality..not good at all. looks stale...........
Really good momos specially try the tandoori momo and streamed momo filling is pretty average plus reasonable rate
""
"taste was nice but expected cheese inside the momos and not above it, thats waste of money and no cheese taste was coming"
Visited this newly opened momo outlet. We ordered fried momos it could be better as I found it was lacking moisture which made them hard to eat it. But the staff was kind and also they maintained good hygiene. Do give it a try.
