Chicken Crunchy was spicy but chicken was like rubber
""
Tandoori was little hard...should have been tender
The food is amazing. Quality of food is also good. The food items are not expensive. Quite good experience
The dal dabba was broken and entire daal was in the plastic cover
"Food quality was not upto the mark
I always order from same hotel but today’s quantity is too less
And butter naan too much soggy"
Taste needs to be improved
"the biryani was not as per standards. the chicken ingredients were absolutely pathetic in taste, unfresh and bland in taste."
quantity too less for the price

"Average place for food and booze. Cost is cheap and competitive. Famous for Indian and Chinese food. Fast delivery, service is good, staff is courteous and fast in service. Quality and quantity of food is good in cheap price."
Tasteless Reshmi Kebab and Keema paratha was too dry and tasteless
very good taste
""
order is wrong
Chicken was half cooked. waste of money and time
""
make it more spicy
Quantity should be more. I feel it is made less especially for online orders.
"They have separate area for family section, bar section ac , non ac. Cards accepted/ gpay etc also. Chinese starters r good here. Prawn biryani is so good here, varities are available in each menu section."
"*SANRAJ RESTAURANT AND BAR*
One of the famous place in bhandup serving you for past many year❤️
It's a nice place with chill kind of environment, you can visit with your friends and family.

The service here is very good ❤️.They also have a Hall for Reception and Birthday Party which Is awesome.

I ordered triple shezwan rice and a lollypop which was actually too much for only me.I alwasy order from others but ordered from here as i had bad expirience from others nearby.as soon as i opened the container got to know this is good one .Food was average but as my nearby guys serve the worst .Giving it a 5
"This is one of my favourite place when it comes to get together with friends. The food here is awesome and the staff is friendly. I love the terrace seating ample space to gather a big group. They also let you play your own music through phone. The service is very quick. What else do you want from a bar which serves you chilled beer, quick service and let you enjoy your part."

"This is a really good place if you are with friends
Has a open garden and service is okay .Do not expect a special notch service place as it is always crowded.You have ample place to park
The restaurant is exactly at the centre of bhandup and kanjur .So you can opt in to move any sides at your convenience
You will find the food okay served in the basic manners and so the price is reasonable"
"A best visted yet, good friendly staff, best service, good food
A must visit place Thankyou team
Love and support for whole staff
I loved the salads and chicken lollipop"
"This is a very good place for nonveg lovers..
So we ordered chicken tandoori,prawns koliwada,chiken lolipop which was really good but the only thing is prices are quite expensive and interior is not that good.."
It's a good restaurant and bar. They has two AC sections and One non AC section. The food quality and taste is very nice. They have separate space for family parties and functions. It is near by Bhandup station at LBS Marg. Opposite the dream mall.
"So to all the non veg lovers here's a small snippet to enjoy. Being here a twice with friends and family. It's a bar restaurant though they have different section for family and children.
Food we ordered -
Chicken Lollipop 3.5/5
Tandoori Chicken 4/5
Chicken Green Masala 3/5
Prawns Koliwada 4/5
The staff and service is good. The ambience and hygiene is what they can work upon. Very well known for all the sea food items since many years."
Worst place ever. No sense of hygiene. Will recommend everyone to avoid this one in Bhandup. Found a bolt(screw) inside the vegetable. How can you trust the kitchen?Zero star
"For the first time in 24 years I m disappointed by this place. This was my favorite family restaurant... Since the age of 1, I m coming here with my family, the the service has degraded like hell... Worst service ever. Only 1 server for 8 tables.
The food here used to be just amazing. But now I feel I wasted my money. The chicken handi was taste less.
Really disappointed.."
If you want best biryani.you will get here. This one actually know for bar in Bhandup but food is also comparatively best.even they are serving alcohol also at best rate
The best dish of sanjraj is their family chicken..i jus love dat dish..whenever i go to sanjraj or order..i always choose this dish..as it's one of my favorite dish..n i would recommend all to try this dish
"It is very nearby form Bhandup station.. and also very close to Dreams mall... here we ate Masala papad, Chicken Angara, chicken Burn chik garlik rise,chicken lahori, amritsari kabab, nd manchurian soup... its very enjoyable...."
Pathetic place. Disgusting food. Most of the dishes are overpriced as if they have a 3star or 5star service. I had ordered Chinese Triple rice which was not at all good in taste and it cost Rs.255. I would recommend anyone to look for some other place even in the worst times when all hotels are crowded. Once tried there will never step again.
Sanjraj hotel is best for its Malvani Chicken. The rates are very high compared to others. Dnt know y but the food is finger licking. The ambience is not comfortable as the bar is also connected to it. And there is no place for separate Resaturant types of.
"This a place with Dine and Wine concept....I tried this place only once and was very disappointed with their suffocating interior and poor quality of food...It's way over priced for their dishes...

Service - 2
Food - 3
Ambience -1
Cost - 2"
Dumb Waiters .. Pathetic Food ... even sitting arrangement is quite below average... I had ordered potato chips as bar snack..  but the chips were so pathetic... i couldnt finish it... so I ordered Finger Chips ... even that was worst in taste... to summarise my experience I wont visit there again.. and wont even recommend to anyone..
I dnt even feel like giving them 1 as a rating...they suck at service ..I had ordered starters and main course I had nt even finished half of my food the waiter prajesh came with a bill this happened at 7 o clock in d evening ..the food was pathetic..... They suck at running a hotel...I will nt recommend this to anyone
"Pathetic service. Avoid at all cost. no accountability. They take orders, cancel after several hours of waiting. Yes hours not minutes!!! Zomato shouldn't even have this restaurant included."
"Very shady place. Food is good with a full bar. Very quiet. Service is ok. Availability till one and as lucky as u can get.
Chilled out ac section.
Overall green for ease."
"They have a tremendous taste for veg iteams
The only thing I didn't like about this hotel is that they have a very dull atmosphere for the customers!!!!"
been visting sanjraj for quite some time now. can say that their chinese menu is good. chicken fried rice and chicken triple schezwan fried rice are better than the rest. even chicken tikka masala and the schezwan chutney they serve with lollipops is good. haven't yet tried the veg menu. staff is friendly but order takes time to get ready. its good that they have family room separately but its usually filled with couples trying to get cozy. overall a decent place with bit high prices.
"Services are not so good...Some dishes is still OK.. Waiters staff is less..
Even Bar is not so good..Chicken Tandoori is worst I ever seen.."
"Visited this on my Mom Dad's anniversary. Completely disappointed. The staff kept us waiting for too long. Service is okay. But but but, they kept us waiting for two long hours! Now isn't that absurd? :O Food also didn't match upto our expectations. I don't think I'll come here again!"
Fantastic food..specially the chicken items..tried chicken chilly and chicken gravy...was yummy...and the service is also really good as well as the ambience..
Had seen the restraunt from outside but never tried it. ordered chicken masala from there. They take orders till 12.30 which is amazing. The masala chicken was great. It was really spicy and tangy. I just felt the chicken was cooked separately and then put inside the masala. And it was a little under cooked. But over all taste wise it was good. The gravy taste took away all its flaws. Will try to taste its mutton and fish dishes.
"they are ready to take order at 12pm in night that to home delivery, awesome, i called new punjab restaurant he was acting tooo smart but on the net it is 12 30 am, bahut masti woh order lenaa waala, sanraj rocks but rich food oil is little more tell him prior, dnt try prawns u will get to see the smallest ever but they serve at 1230 am thats cool"
