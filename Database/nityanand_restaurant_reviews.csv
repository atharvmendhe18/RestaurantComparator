In the customised item I had added extra cheese. They sent me a cube of cheese. Am I supposed to grate the cheese and add it in the bhaji. No onions or Lemon received with the food item. Can't rate them in Minus so 1 star
Bathure could have been better

Sandwich got delivered after 1 hrs despite it showed only 23 min when I placed it. never order food from here if it's near your home restaurant. Playing blame game with zamoto guy that he didn't arrive I can see that guy is near restaurant waiting for order. Nityanand thinks customer and zomato are idiots to fool. Very disappointed by the service
