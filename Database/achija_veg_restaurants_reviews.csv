Pannner Tikka Masal wasnâ€™t packed properly. It spilled out in carry bag.
Achija always gives extraordinary service and yummy meals. One of my favourite restaurants around town. The meals served rapidly and the rates were reasonable specially the cheese pav bhaji! Highly recommended.

"worst food i have ever had of my life..

The taste,the quality,the hygiene everything was of the lowest standard.....

extremely oily and artifical colours used in every dish...

very very dangerous for health..

This restaurant should be reported for using all bad ingredients

Request everyone to never order anything from this restaurant"
Salty food

"Achija was popular for it's pav bhaji but what I got that day was stale smelly bhaji with pav drenched on butter so much that I could squeeze the pav to drain 100 gms of butter from it.
It was inedible and worst pav bhaji I could have ever had.
So disappointed"
