Delivery driver couldn’t speak any English even though I’m English and told him 30 times I’m English. He was on the wrong street and told me he’s here. Waited 15 mins for him and the food arrived cold. Don’t order from Zomato if you are a foreigner. Absolutely shocking unprofessional service
there should be option to order without mayo and Lettuce. is it possible?
"totally atrocious
so messed up packing , one will never want to ever eat burger and fries again. one thing to learn from burger king.

fries which is mc USP will become the most hated thing.

Sprite was worst than water. what junk is being sent for something McDonald's making so much money and yet serving so bad stuff.

i surely want a refund"
