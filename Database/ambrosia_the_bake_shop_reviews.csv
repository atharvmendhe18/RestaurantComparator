Awesome cake by ambrosia cake shop. Received a chocolate cake from a friend on my birthday and trust me it was just finger licking. Just loved it.
"So sustainability at its best , all the cakes are yumm and the pricing is so good , the seasonal cakes are to die for specially the fresh strawberry üçì one and all the chocolate ones have been great for so many years

The worst customer service that anyone can deliver. The staff does not care if your order is right or wrong. Absolute waste of time and money. The staff is arrogant and absolute worst.
"Location : Shop No 4, Fairlawn building, Opp to Diamond Garden, Chembur East

Ordered : Chicken cupcake, Red Penne pasta

Review : This place is quite under rated coz its not well know like other joints in Chembur. Their servings are good in quantity and most important delicious. Pasta Sauce was amazing.

Other reviews : Seating for 10 people. Outdoor seating to available for 10 people. You won't be allowed to sit inside here for a long time. The staff is a little rude. They start playing lot music so that u get disturbed. Maybe that's the reason people don't turn up here.

Suggestions : Being polite and giving a good experience to their customers

Quantity : 5/5
Service : 3/5
Ambience : 4/5"
"Very attentive and helpful staff. Great choices, great ambience and nice comfy setup. In chembur I would rate this the best bake shop. Yes on a price to price comparison it is pricier than the some other cheaper options...but its all evens out when you compare the quality and quantity Vs the pricing. Whats that popular word...chindi chor...they are not that....they dont try to save money on giving you next to no stuffing in the puffs and rolls, they dont try and not give you tissues.... All that counts."
"The blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate pastries are my favourite here. Recently tried the oreo and the truffle cupcakes and they were delicious too! A very pocket friendly bake shop serving such a huge variety of desserts, it'll make you fall in love! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"A lovely place. Ambience is good. Ordered pasta in pink sauce which tasted yum, the pastries there are pretty good as are the chocolate croissant and the macaroons, however, we ordered rice in Thai curry which didn't appeal to me all that much. Overall, it's a decent place with good food."
"Quick bites, on go sandwiches.
If you are lucky enough to find cheese garlic croissant, PICK IT UP. Oh! And ask them to warm it well. You're welcome."
"A great place to just sit and relax while sipping coffee or a hot chocolate or an Americano! Great place if you do not want to shed much.
You usually get a parking!

"It‚Äôs a cute bake shop cum cafe opp Kstar mall in Chembur .
Have been there many times for my favourite brownie üòç
And it‚Äôs a good place to chill ‚úîÔ∏è"
Small cafe for just a small sitting for coffee or pasta or something italian which is really amazing!! Great taste and quick service which just adds up to the value of the small place.perfect place for a lot can happen over coffee.
"Very helpful and friendly staff , I love their baked vadapav , have enjoyed and relished their garlic bread . The Easter eggs were definitely a hit .."
We recently ordered a cake for a party and our theme was destination ....Loved the destination cake made for us . All our guest also loved and nothing was left for the next day
"Pineapple, Dutch Truffle and Fruit Cake are their best cakes that I‚Äôve had so far. Never had a complaint about the cakes being too spongey/stale.

Like a regular cafe, they also serves other food items like puffs and coffee which are pretty filling too.

A pocket friendly place serving fresh cakes!"
"- descent place
- variety is descent (nothing exceptional)
- friendly staff
- their chicken cup is üôåüèª
- my luck or what I don't know but most of the times they are out of stock on items that I want to eat at that moment
- descent seating available too
- definitely their snacks has more filling than other competitors in the area
& with that also comes the price but nothing too expensive"
"Cute little bakery in chembur,good for dates. The ambiance and location is the best in chembur,food quality has come down since i've been visiting this place for years but love going here. Pastas are always amazing."
"They don't deliver even within 2 kms distance and it's shown on zomato as if they do home delivery wrongly informing customers, Request Zomato to please check the vendor and update on the site so at least customers are not missing guided"
"This place has the most amazing Tiramisu I have eaten in the longest time, it is so light and so good on flavour!! They have good sandwiches and coffee! Definitely one of the best bake shops!!"
"A walk in cake and coffee shop, you can easily step in and have a good cup of coffee and relax.
It's a small place with 3-4 indoor seats and same amount of seats outside as well.
Coffee is really good, really really good... Cappuccino is amazingly made and you can sit and relax with us.
Their spinach and corn and veg sandwiches is really yummmm... must tryyy
We tried the blueberry muffins as well, but the taste was a little stale."
"Its been quite a while since I found a place that could really pamper my taste buds, as far as desserts are concerned! Their menu is apt; offering neither too much nor too little. Till date I've had Tiramisu, Chocolate mousse, lemonade and chocolate pastry at The Ambrosia; and trust me you won't be disappointed! I really recommend their tiramisu and mousse! The place is small but cozy and ambience is satisfactory. The staff is courteous and helpful. Its a place worth visiting, if you are around Chembur area and need a respite!"
"Lovely sandwiches and pastries .I would always stop here for a quick bite . Small seating arrangement which is quite nice .
Also they serve very nice coffee . It is Perfect college hangout joint."
The chocolate pastries aren't too bad. But I found the cupcakes and macarons rather disappointing. I suppose I should have ordered something else?
"A small outlet in Chembur... Like a coffee shop just 2 tables outside and 2 tables inside. You get the service across the counter mostly self service. Offers you Puffs, Pastries, Sandwiches, Tea/ coffee, Quench and all.... We ordered for Chicken Tikka Sandwich and Chicken Quench. Sandwich was good but quenche was bad, u could only get the strong flavour of nutmeg thats all... I couldn't even finish it. Iys good for quick bites. An average food joint i would say."
I tried mud cake here and it was really good. The cage had good texture and flavour with proper layering of cream. You can also try sanwiches and Swiss chocolate which was really yummy. Do order for birthday parties in Chembur.
"The very word ""cake"" is of Norwegian origin, it is taken from the Norse word ""Kaka"". Germans call it 'Kuchen', Greeks call it œÄŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶œÇ (Plakous) and the British named it 'Cake'. Russia itself uses a loan word '—Ç–æ—Ä—Ç' which is taken from the German 'Torte'. This concludes the very quest for the most delicious cake, if one thinks about it. It was always a delicacy within the boundaries of Scandinavia and Europe before it spread across the globe.

Milk is the most vital ingredient in a cake. European goats and cows play a big role in defining the very taste of a cake. Many times bread dough is enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, cheese and even beer and liquor which produces a...read more"
"I quote ""Best cheese cake in chembur "" its pure heaven treat.The place is too quiet good and coffee too was amazing .
but the cake is the best part and its quite cheap too .Must try people"
This is one of my very favourite bake shops. There's no personal space so best for take away. If you're a dark chocolate fan then Dark Rich Chocolate here is simply amazing.
"Ambrosia is the place I've been going to since my school days, it's a tiny bake shop with limited seating. They have some really cool cakes and snacks! My favourite is the Baked Batata Vada, Spinach Quiche and Veg. Pasta üòç"
"This is one of my favorite place for desserts.cold coffee,lemon ice tea are aweosme as beverages.be it tirmasu,fruit pudding cake, chocolate truffle.just amazing...the ambienc is also cute.. will definitely have a great time over there."
Its a cute small place on the main road. Their cakes are good especially the dark chocolates one. The dome cake is really tasty. Even their savory is quite decent.
"This is one of my favorite places for desserts in Mumbai. All of their cakes are amazing, be it chocolate almond or dark rich chocolate but their Dome Cake is just brilliant.

Also, I have never had a better Lemon Iced Tea than the one which they have. It is the best one."
"It is a little place located in the busy sion trombay road 
The Dome Cake : is a Dome of happiness 
Their cup cakes are a must avoid , they are horrible 
THeir rose cake is ok . Apple crumble only resembles an apple crumble but is delicious 
Any way it has a good ambiance and good staff"
A small place in chembur. Regular hangout place for school going kids as it's near a school. The pasta is a dish that one should have if you visit.
"A small joint located in the hustle and bustle of chembur's sion trombay road is really a desert lovers paradise.

As soon as u enter you get a hit of the smell of the freshness of the breads and other lovely deserts here.

It has got a few chairs and tables here and there if u want to eat on the spot but I would recommend it's better to take away from here.

If you have any special recommendations or favourite pastries that you are looking forward to its better to call up and go there since they have only the hot favourites which sell out quickly.

I went ahead and got myself the oreo & caramel cupcake along with a chocolate croissant. Ended up spending 170 rs but let me tell you it...read more"
It's a small place but it delivers good flavor. The chocolate croissants is heavy and delicious. The cupcakes are one of the absolute best I have ever tasted. The buttercream is just fabulous. The cakes are really good too !
"The whiff of freshly baked bread that encapsulates you when you open the doors to Ambrosia is what gets you to love it!
I have usually picked multi grain breads and garlic loaves here. This time I decided to get their blueberry cheesecake and chocolate chip muffin. Both were gorgeous. Melt in mouth and nailed in terms of taste and perfection.
Priced at par with Batista and Costa , Ambrosia sure does deliver in terms of good taste and a cool place to hang out.
Would have loved if the cafe was a bit less noisier. But then some days are like that.
All in all our fave place for breads and bakes."
One of my favourite place to hangout with friends over a coffee. Chicken sandwiches that they serve are my favourite. The cupcakes that they serve are perfectly presented are equally delicious...
"Well a small bake shop by look but carries some great flavours. Must try lemon iced tea, having the perfect tinge of tea. One of the best veg sandwiches (veg grilled) and macaroons that melt in mouth. Amongst coffee choc and strawberry, strawberry macaroon tasted best. Alot of other happy sweet things to offer and some great pastries to indulge in. Overall a great place for some gossip and sugar."
"Value for money and good place to get a cup of coffee or hot chocolate in the evening over the weekend.. It goes very well along with a chicken roll or a chocolate pastry that they serve here.. The menu here gives you a good break from regular other coffee chains as it is not a franchise serving the same few items across outlets..
service is pretty decent and quick. The location is just perfect..it is located on the main road right in the heart of Chembur and we often like to walk down to this place in the evening.."
"Its a good place all in all. Pricing is upto the mark. All they need is to train their staff a bit in communicating well with the customers. Second point which i wanted to mention is about their mango milk shake. It was white in colour and there was no mango in it! Everything in it was artificial, please use real stuff at least during the season! I was confused whether to have it or give it. Who puts vanilla ice cream in a mango milk shake? Anyways, cakes and other items are excellent and fresh."
"This place will always be my lifetime memory. After school hours this was our fast last resort for indulging into great food. Chocolate and Garlic and Cheese Croissants have always been my favourite. How much ever we ate we never got bored of it. Their pastries, pastas and Thai curry are toothsome as well. Whenever I visit this place I'm always taken aback with the consistent taste they have but, definitely not consistent in terms of prices. Small bake shop that will surely put your taste buds in action. Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
It's a Bake shop but they serve Coffee too. A very nice place for hangout in Chembur not too much of chaos as in cafe's . Lots of option for bakery products . Try out Cold coffee they serve it in a jumbo glass and also cheese cake.
"Nice place to catch up with friends ..
The pastries and all tasted good ..
Tiramisu was best .. Ordered it twice ..
The ambience was normal !"
Their bread is really good. Especially the multigrain. As also the ragi biscuits - make sure they are fresh though as they tend to get soft after awhile. Good service and good cakes. They are especially fresh if you order them.
I have been a regular customer here soelely for the reasonable coffee and cupcakes.The staff is extremely unsupportive and indifferent to customers.VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
they have no logic. Asking for a minimum order of 300 plus charging 80 rupees for delivery. Absolutely rude person on call. Never calling again.
"Good varities of breads, croissant , cup cakes, pastries.
Have tried multigrain, fibre, garlic bread. Also had chocolate and cheese garlic croissant.

Must try."
"Nice place to hangout in the evening when you have nothing to do on Saturdays or Sundays.
Decently priced & good ambience for a cafe/cake shop.
Good cupcakes & pies."
"Doesn't look like the best ever, from outside but when I walked in, it was quite the opposite! With a variety of bakery items to choose from to bakes too, the list is unending!

A settled for a chocolate croissant because their racks were almost empty by 8PM when I had gone, and didn't have much hope when suddenly the chocolate from within kissed me and I changed my mind about the croissant immediately!

Try it out ONCE. I liked the place. If you don't like it, don't go there again. But Ambrosia deserves ONE chance FOR SURE!"
"It's a little quaint place with big signboard on the VN Purav Marg, not easily missed. Their bakery products are quite good , Red Velvet and cupcakes recommended. They offer decent nibbles, but the good ones can be the ones that finish fast , so that should be kept in mind if your venturing there post tea time. Their shakes leave something to be desired, coffee is okay. It would be a nice place to chill, however the staff seems a little hostile ."
"Had been longing to go here since quite some time...because of the yummy cupcakes that my friend described me about!
Sooo..me and my friends decided to meet here and everything we ate was coincidently CHOCOLATE!
We had the Ferrero Rocher cupcake, the chocolate cupcake, chocolate roll and a chocolate croissant!
My favourite of the lot was hands down the chocolate and the Ferrero rocher cupcake!
Nice ambience, reasonably priced...great place to hangout with friends! Shall definitely visit again üòä"
"Ambrosia is a quaint bakery that serves both sweet as well savoury items. Amazing sandwiches, great cake pops and some amazing brownies. Their milkshakes are very good. Must try their pastas and spinach corn sandwiches."
This again is suited for couples and a cute place that serves amazing deserts sandwhichees puffs shakes etc. Their cakepops is a unique dish which is popular and is a value for money desert
Ordered the ferrero rocher cake from here... Gave order in the morning and picked it up in the evening... The cake was delicious... Decent pricing.... Must go...
"One of the places where i can chill all day long with my friends!! Good food, good service and good ambiance!! The only thing lacking is the Pasta they served till sometime back!! We miss that. Its a request to start that again!!"
"This one is something the opposite of you enjoy street food more because it is cheap you don't mind the quality compromise.

Ordered red velvet cake and blueberry cake. Blueberry was juicy with dollops of blue berry in and on the pastry. Cold coffee was decent. All of this for 300 I would have given ambrosia a 5/5. But all this came to a whopping Rs. 500! And thus I mind the quality compromise!!!
Too much shelling for a good experience."
"Ambrosia: a small outlet in eastern suburbs of Mumbai, Chembur to be specific. I decided to catch up with my sister over some coffee and deserts so we landed up there. At 9 PM, this place looked pretty leas crowded but we entered and started looking for some options in having some cold beverages like coffee but cudnt find any options so had to order normal cold coffe without ice cream. Along with it, we ordered for a blueberry cheesecake and red velvet cake. It didn't take even 5 minutes for them to make 2 portions of cold coffee which certainly gave me an idea how it would be and it turned out to be something which below average than a normal cold coffee. Though deserts turned out to be...read more"
"We often order birthday cakes from Ambrosia Chembur. The quality is excellent, consistent and has never let us down. Home delivery is an added benefit.
The savoury snacks, muffins and sandwiches are extremely delicious.
 
The shop itself is clean, airconditioned cool, and cozy. Service is excellent too.

I just hope they continue the good job so we customers are able to patronise this lovely place."
"A really good place to just hang out with friends and chat over a coffee. Although it's a bake shop,
I love the food more in here - I love the chicken sandwiches , the rolls , crossaints , pasta. I'm crazy for the garlic chicken sandwich. I also like the cupcakes. However I feel the pastries are over priced. None the less they taste good!"
I love this place.  It is the best to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I just love the Chocolate truffle and cheesecakes. Its amazing and worth to try.
Friendly ambience.. the staff is very friendly and helpful too... full marks for them... it is a pocket friendly bake shop... with different varieties of desserts and pastry.
"One of my fav. Hangout In chembur since ages.. Love this cute,small little cafe..
But one thing I wana suggest is u guys should again start with your pizza and pasta
(red& white) as thy wr the best..
At times its bit boring to hv same sandwiches or croissants or muffins..
A request from a regular customer..
Thnx.. üíï"
"The outlet here is compact, but is quiet efficient in their service. The quality is just awesome, though costlier than the local shops, it is worth it. The cake is finely baked to perfection with such a soft texture,and the chocolate has really its own fine taste. The two pastries in the pic, which i had did seem to be worth the money."
"Have been ordering cakes from here for quite sometime now. They have been absolutely indulging and delicious.

The fondant and the sugar crafting customization has been perfect to how I wanted as always. They never disappoint with their crafting and their taste is consistent as always. Amazing is the word !

All Staff also corporate to customer. Heads off to ALL THE STAFF.."
Having a desert lover friend is the best thing I guess....not a desert lover though but this place has best cupcakes I feel and cheesecakes too they don't provide you with big sitting area but doesn't matter if they are serving good food
"I ordered a Cake with them(butter chocolate) for my 4 year olds Birthday n that was the worst mistake ever! It was stale, the icing had turned sour n so had the cake. It looked miserable too. We had to go without a cake and she was all tears! On calling them up to tell them about it, they were hardly apologetic, all they said was you can return teh cake if you like! I would give it a negative rating if I could. Please do not bother trying this place if you havent already had the misfortune of being here. The customer service is miserable too."
"Ambrosia is a saving grace for those who have a sweet tooth in Chembur. Its variety of Muffins, Brownies, pastries, truffles pastries, sandwiches and milk shakes will leave you dazzled for sure, but each one of these is definitely worth a try for sweetness' sake!
My favourites include Chocolate truffle, chocolate brownie and fruit cakes.
The ambience is equally good as well, its one of those few cake shops which has seating facility as well, which gives it extra points."
"Omg. I love this freaking place. Best chicken quiches,chicken rolls and sandwiches. Really tasty eclairs and cup cakes. Loved every bit of it. Very afforadable as well."
"I was looking for a good cake joint in Chembur, I went here and had like two cheesecakes with my sister
1) blueberry cheesecake
2) red velvet cheesecake

When it was served to me, I was mesmerised looking at the luscious texture and it put a smile on my face, I was so exited to dig the spoon into it, i hated the cheesecake, trust me it was the worst experience ever, it ruined my joy of coming here to eat the cake.
The blueberry cheesecake - first bite was great, the second and third bite makes you realise that, they've added more of whipping cream in the cheesecake than the cream cheese..
The biscuit base didn't add on to the flavour or taste instead was so bland
Above all it was...read more"
"Ambrosia has the best cupcakes I've ever had in Mumbai. Their sandwiches aren't that great though. But if you're looking to get some good desserts in Chembur, Ambrosia is the best. Their macaroons and pastries are amazing too."
"Really good desserts.. love da cakes, mini cake pops, croissants ,n a lot more .. dey keep coming up with new ideas n inspiring dessert concepts"
"The pastries aren't really fresh. They're over frozen. The bread isn't outstanding either. It's a place to go when you're craving for a pastry, and nothing else is nearby."
Ambrosia is the best place for cakes and macroon in Chembur. I personally am very fond of their cupcakes (especially red velvet) and their macroons. Its also a very good place for an evening coffee with friends.
"Today I wanted to eat at some place I had never eaten before and a friend suggested Ambrosia. It's a small place with four tables inside and an outside seating arrangement as well.
We tried the chicken junglee sandwich - very very yummy, and the chicken almond and tomatoes with cheese sandwich - not bad.
Then we had a strawberry milk shake which was very well made and a cold coffee with was good too.
These were the pros, now the cons. We ordered for a chicken quiche which was horrible the filling was like scrambled egg paste and didn't really have any chicken. The waitress are noisy and talk loudly and the service is slow.
The desserts are supposed to be really good but the milkshake...read more"
Nice cakes and pastries specially the chocochip Dutch truffle but the only draw back is the staff . Very rude at times and ignorant .... When on call for home delivery they don't wanna speak in English and sound not interested . This I have always experienced otherwise it's worth a visit place
"This place has arguably the best cupcakes and cheesecake in Chembur. We were in search for some new cakeshops in Chembur and Zomato told that this was the most near by option.

Ambrosia is located opposite K Star Mall AMD is tucked between a medical store and Ammi's Biryani. We entered the dim lit outlet and we met a string of mouth watering and delicious looking cakes, tarts, pastries, cheesecakes, macrons, cupcakes, sandwiches and some savouries. Four tables inside the outlet and four outside, it can accommodate 8 groups of four.

We surfed through the cakes; though it was difficult for us to zero down on one, we selected the Chocolate Dome Cake. As we had a lot of buffer time, we...read more"
"Easily the best cake shops we have in chembur, their chocolate cakes n pastries are perfect for any occasion. Later we discovered this place does fantastic food too - chicken Frankies, rolls are just too good! My favourite here is the chicken stroganoff. Food wise easily one of the best places chembur has in its roster"
"Nice and busy little place this in Chembur .
Just an impromptu stop for a coffee and you see a lot of Bakery stuff .
Had a Croissants ( cheese) and a Cup cake which was YUM and some Coffee.
Will surely visit this if i happen to be in that area."
Great place to hangout! Used to go there after school! Must try 1. Dome pastry 2. Ferrero Rocher cupcakes 3. Garlic and cheese croissants 3. Pasta in bechamel 4. Pizza Cup. Must try if you're in the are!
"Great evening hang out place. Love their blueberry muffins, cheese and garlic croissant, chicken and mint mayo sandwich, cold coffees etc! Total hit!!"
"Located off the Chembur-Panvel highway (opposite KStar mall), one can sit back and relax here (if tables are available) or can order for takeaway (which I prefer). Their veg croissant, veg puff and veg cheese & garlic croissant is quite tasty and decently priced.

Overall: If you're looking to sit with a friend for long hours, you're better off going to Barista that's a few meters away. Stick around for a nice place to grab a quick bite, if you manage to get a table."
"Browniessssssss........... There is no better place for brownies than ambrosia. Had a chance encounter with this place after my usual place didnt have the kind of choclate cake i wanted.
Now i am a dedicated fan of their brownies n choclate cakes."
The best kind of cakes and pastries are found here. You can blindly swear on any of their desserts and they never disappoint you. Amazing place to spend some quality time and a sweet to your tooth.
"The pasta and blueberry cheesecake are a must try.Decent food and hangout place for Chembur people.Located at maitri park.
Very reasonable so affordable for youngsters to grab a snack."
"Located In the midst of chemist shops and florists, it‚Äôs quite easy to miss this one..  Nothing great about the place, so to say..  it‚Äôs usually filled with chembur teenagers who drop in for a quick bite or two‚Ä¶ Their cakepops are yum.. the chocolate one is decent, but the red velvet one is much better !

They have a decent spread of pastries, macaroons, cupcakes and cakes.. puffs and breads.. their garlic bread is quite good.. their chocolate excess cake and dome cakes taste good.. their cupcakes too are nice‚Ä¶ but nothing extraordinary, for sure!

But, coming to the service - The staff is quite impolite and discourteous.. and that can be a real put-off! it has an indoor as well...read more"
