"Very poor quality food.
No taste at all.
Very bad soup.Tangy."

The veg crispy was totally soggy and tasteless. Not as per expectations. Too much of corn starch.
They are always the best providers with starters or main course whether its quality or quantity.
""
Very small portion. Serves one only.

If restaurants does not want to compete order on time they have to cancel order
"The customer service was very awful and wasnâ€™t welcoming at all. Even though asked multiple times werenâ€™t told the portion sizes and then were told the wrong sizes. They sent in the wrong order and refused to take it back . The food made us feel sick after eating. The bathroom was unhygienic, littered and wasnâ€™t taken care of"
