Food was not worth calling fine dining.
The manager is very rude. The rest of the staff was cooperative but the manager was not at all ready to guide us at the table. The manager should be fired.

"Delicious nonveg!! I've ordered chicken dishes thrice from Amantran in a month's time and each time the chicken was well-cooked and taste consistentüëåüèªKalimiri Chicken starters were good,not too spicy while Tandoori Chicken was spicy masaledaar. The best one is their home-cooked Chicken Curry - it's just too good!! Their portion size is adequate for 2 people to share. Food packaging is good, delivery on time and the Egg Salad is a lovely surprise that lifts the whole mealüëçüèª"

I had a very weird experience. The manager (booking person) was so rude he was not at all ready to take our booking I don't understand what his problem is only keep on saying that we have already booked so we can't take any booking. He doesn't have any courtesy to at least try it means they are not interested in building new customers They are pretty much happy with their existing clients and happy to serve them only. we have decided not to visit this restaurant in future.

There is a separate charge for packaging but the package is spilled
Tawa Bhuna masala badly made and very sticky
"The capsicum in the gravy was spoilt and it made the whole gravy taste bad. Please check before putting any such ingredients. It not only spoils the taste and experience, but it also spoils the reputation of your restaurant. Was very disappointed with this. Had to throw out the entire box in garbage. So much food wastage."

the ambiance is good and a recommended family restaurant. The food was good and could try the best of dishes with the help of Mr. Azar who suggested some real good dishes.
""
Veg Kofta Curry was too oily. The koftas were very hard.

The quantity in chicken sukka was very less for a dish that cost Rs499. it had only 3 small pieces
"MANSOOR the manager is extremely bad at his job.

He doesn't have the basic ethic of service. Very rude and arrogant person.

Would never recommend Amantran.

Worst service experience.

The manager MANSOOR in fact asked us to leave the restaurant if we are not liking the service knowing the fact there are children and senior citizens.

If the owner is reading this please take strong action and you can reach out to us to know details about the Managers behaviour"

very slow delivery will never order from here
Non plastic packaging would be great to have.
All the dishes were good. Prawns bhuna was sweet which needs to be little spicy
"The Food and as excellent, although the Palak patta chat was good but very dry, usually some yoghurt, green chutney and tamarind sauce is topped over it. Rest of the items were excellent."
Quantity less
there is a scope for improvment.

Quite tasty but prices are too much! Amantran needs to work on their pricing.
