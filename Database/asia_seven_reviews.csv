Review
"A descent meal good for a regular outing.
Noting out of the blue or eye catching."
"Elegant ambience! Offers best of wines. Incase you are unable to decide, you can try a few to make your choice. Don't miss on veg tom kha soup which is spicy and just enough tangy! Pepper garlic chicken though was decent."
Authentic Asian food. Loved their nasi goreng!
"Awesome Asian food. Their Virgin Mohito is so aweeesome. Their Virgin piña colada is so sweet :D

Their spring rolls were superb.

Their veg sushi (ummm) sumthn different, I have never had :P

Their Thai curry is so awesome with their sticky rice :D

Flat Noodles is good too:)

N their dessert of Red Velvet Cake is the most awesome cake ever ^^"
Their khow suey is to die for and the service is quite good. Authentic cuisine and an overall good experience
"We went there for dinner, the server recommended pomfret in garlic sauce & chicken black bean..the pomfret was smelly & the chicken cold...The main course took 30 mins to arrive which was again cold..the phad Thai noodles were uncooked, bamboo rice didn't have salt.
Overall a very bad dining experience wouldn't ever go there again..."
Hi there.....im from malaysia and im a chinese.....i have a difficulty to find the right chinese cuisine taste........im very particular and fussy bout my meal....but this place serve me well until i lift my legs up....its nice.pls come to this place if u want to have a gteat tast of chinese cuisine....
"located at Palladium Mall, and as the name suggests it serves cuisine from 7 countries of south east asia.
We were here for lunch and ordered for 4 starters and 3 main course dishes.
The food was creatively presented and delicious.
The chicken won ton was delicious, however the Pad Thai noodles we had , was over powered by coconut.
The restaurant is not expensive, considering the quality of the food, the ambiance and the location, but not value for money.

I have had Chinese food at many restaurants, but this one failed to impress my taste buds.

Damage done - approx 1800 for two"
"Ok so to begin with there weren't the seven promised cuisines of Asia in this dingy, badly designed eatery.
No duck dishes were available in spite of there being an entire section devoted to it.
Service was trashy. They were clueless and honestly didn't seem to care about whether people stayed and ate or left. Complete non chalance. They actually turned off the ac midmeal!!
Dimsums and the tenderloin starters were good but have had much much better khouswey elsewhere.
Will we go back?

Of course not!"
Kung pao potatoess.... veg bento box was not tht great but pitcher of lemon ice tea pretty much was the relief ...loved the decor and the red candle stand on the table ..very vivacious yet a formal place !
"Classy Ambiance, Awesome Food and Great Hospitality. This place is truly flawless."
"I am a hard core Mainland China fan so reluctantly I tagged along to Asia 7 and did not participate in the ordering. For starters, the broccoli and almond dimsums won me over - very delicious and refreshing but the crispy vegetables were really really bad - oily and doughy. Lemon coriander soups and mocktails were so so. Flavoured Nonya rice (if i remember correctly) was served in a special bamboo container and was good although the recipe said cooked with bamboo shoots, it wasn't. We had everything on the desert platter that boasted red velvet cake, philadelphia cheese cake, apple pie, ....and more - all just about passing the bill. Pan-Asian in India boils down to Chinese....the menu...read more"
Good food. Good ambience. But bad management. Sunday lunch 2 tables came in just after us and were not even given their starters when we finished our meal. Both tables objected and called upon the manager. They sent someone to attend WHILE THE MANAGER JUST SAT BACK AND WATCHED !!! He came in after both the tables were pleading/shouting/ demanding for TWENTY MINUTES. Whats up with the management man ? Guess thats what a paid manager is for when the place is owned by a chain. No higher authority contact was offered to grieve with !! Sad to see a fine restaurant run by an unprofessional manager ! One of the tables even had children. Atleast offer contact of the management for a customer...read more
"Dear Management,

I have been to your palladium restaurant couple of times... I have enjoyed the food especially Burmese khow Suey. It is probably one of the best in town.

In my last visit... I had a bad experience. I was being told by my mom to get some JAIN food - JAIN food is prepared without onion / garlic / potato / mushroom / other roots. I was not sure whether restaurant served JAIN food. Hence I checked with the waiter and he confidently suggested stir fry and noodles. We relied on waiters suggestion and ordered stir fry and noodles for mom. Our parcel Was handed over to us along with the bill. I assumed that food was in line with what we ordered ie JAIN. Once we reached home...read more"
"Normally I give ridiculous reasons to excuse myself from eating chinese (my bf loves it). I have never been a fan of South East Asian cuisine ( I love Thai food though) but I never ever refuse or fuss over a dinner date at Asia Seven. The flavours are subtle, the ambience lovely, the decor charming and the staff elegant. Its a special place where both of us enjoy the food as much as we love our dinner time together!"
"Writing this long overdue 'review' given we've made quite a few trips to Asia 7's Lower Parel restaurant. To be honest, we never had the chance to sample their fare in Delhi so the wife and I were quite pleased with our first experience in Asia 7 Mumbai. Both of us are quite fond of 'Oriental cuisine', having spent some time in that part of the world and are quite biased when it comes to Japanese food, particularly Sushi!

It was not just the food we like here but also the hospitality of the staff, who always make us feel quite welcome. They are also quite good at recommending dishes as well as wine to go along with them.

Our last visit was on February 14 and the place was packed! It was...read more"
Good Asian blend mix of many dishes of the Asian countries served on your plate
"My first review on Zomato. And I am writing it because I want readers to steer clear of this place.
The ambience is attractive and inviting. Even the menu is very interesting. But my score of this restaurant reflects the food I was served.
The lack of knowledge of the captain and disconnect with the customer did not help.
2 dishes very difficult to go wrong with were ordered.
1. Salt and pepper crispy fish. Too much garnish and masala took away from the flavour of the fish.
2. Sticky rice with chef's special basil chicken. Only brief given was too not make it too spicy. Bur the dish was unnecessarily hot. Too dry, basil flavour overpowering.
It gets 1 for serving chilled kingfisher...read more"
"It’s the year of the Horse! Lets celebrate with a family dinner in Asia 7. I have been seeing this restaurant on every visit to Palladium in Lower Parel but somehow never ventured in. This Feb 1st when I entered the restaurant I was halted by a staff at the door. She explained that on the occasion of Chinese New Year they have arranged for a lucky draw. We were told to pick up from a Chinese vase kept at the doorway. And we did! Imagine what came up ? Buy two plates of Sushi get two plates of Sushi free ! For a family of two adults and one kid isn’t that too much of Sushi? Obviously we did not agree to take the offer, to which the lady got impatient and said “You have to take an...read more"
"The new menu is mindblowingly awesome. Only downside is the quantities have reduced and the prices have gone up.
But i'd rate this place as one of my top 3 must eat oriental places in Bombay.

1. The khow suey is to die for
2. The mae goreng - I doubt if the indonesians could make it any better
3. The thai currys are the best i've tasted in this city
4. The sushi is fantastic
5. The service is excellent"
the most exclusive buffet with great variety and flavours in the grills and chinese segment. Theire desserts are never ending and to die for specially their crembrule!!!
"Come here often for lunch, considering its proximity to work and my love for asian food. The silken tofu dimsum is highly recommended. The Thai food is quite good, but the Chinese food is not quite upto the mark. The lotus stem rice is awesome, and this place serves some of the best Phad Thai I have eaten in Mumbai. Service is not exceptional, and its a tad too expensive. A good option for an Asian lunch if you are around Lower Parel."
"Food is decent but not worth the money they charge. You don't mind paying till you see the taxes they charge which is shameful.
They know that people come to enjoy and towards the end of the meal they are not going to argue for a few rupees.

With 2 aerated drinks and food the total came up to Rs. 3920 they charge 12.5% VAT where as two aerated waters were included so they should have charged me 12.5% on Rs. 3670 as we had consumed two pepsi's priced Rs. 125 each. On aerated waters there is a VAT of 20% . So they charged me 12.5% on Rs. 250 and again 20% separately!

This is what they billed me :

Rs. 3920.00- total bill for food and beverages
Rs. 504.63 - VAT on FB 12.5% (I don't...read more"
The way this restaurant is calculating the service tax and vat is wrong. They have a wrong system in the computer it self and imagine when we actually calculated it was 100 Rs less than actually we should pay.How much money they must be making by misguiding the customer. Thay should be honest.
For a person who was tasting shushi for the first time i am unable to comment on the same. The seafood beijing soup which we ordered was a little bit on the salty side. The tiger prawn dimsum was ok which did not have much of any flavour other than the boiled taste of prawn. We had to dip it in sauce to get some taste. The chicken panfried noodles was good though. All this costed without dessert to 2.5k easily. Not recommended for people with a taste for indochinese.
Went for dinner to Asia 7 as part of a GourmetItUp deal. Was amazing! It was a set menu but the portions were huge and the staff was very courteous. All in all an amazing experience. Every dish in the 7 course meal was perfect and the deserts especially the honey noodles with ice cream were simply mind blowing. Would definitely come back again.
"Landed up going to this place because of one of those Gourmetitup Offer. Some fixed menu stuff. Terribly disappointing. The portions are poor. We complained and then they served some more of the offering.

Food taste - everything seemed to be just too spicy on the menu that night. There is spicy and the the unbearable spicy. So make sure you order with caution. Chicken Satay peanut sauce was just too mucky ... Gone wrong I suppose.

Mid-way they ran out of tofu so they decided to serve an alternative dish without telling us what it was. Only when asked were we told about the shortcoming. Not appreciated.

Thankfully ended the dinner on a sweet note thanks to some decent desserts - the...read more"
"I visited the place on a weekday. Had the seven course meal and I loved every single course.
tips: try malaysian chicken satay, honkong noodles and home made coconut and jaggery ice-cream"
"If you like Asian food then this place is a good bet. Asian food is all about subtle flavours. To which the food here does good justice. So do not expect strong flavours of spice.

Since I can't try or eat much in one meal. I go there often. The ambience is good too."
"An amazing place , good food and pleasant atmosphere . The staff is very kind and pay a lot of attention to their customers . It is a little pricy , but totally worth it . Should be there on every foodie's wish list . Totally made my day. Went with a friend for a celebration and and enjoyed a lot ."
"been coming here since it started, its a little pricey but a good place to eat at every once in a while"
"Do try out the Asia 7 special Khow Suey Chicken the next time you go there- it's Burmese cuisine at its best. Though on the expensive side, the meal is good enough for two. And if you order an appetizer along with this, you won't have any space left in your stomach for desserts. Try it out if you are a chicken lover who likes experimenting with food!"
"First of all, the place looks awesome. I was in no mood for Asian cuisine but the decor just pulled me! Didn't feel that I was in Mumbai.

Ordered Yodufu soup,Som Tam salad and Veg Sushi Platter (10 pcs).

The soup didnt taste so nice but no complaints. Salad was awesome and so was the sushi!
The dressing of the salad was yum, especially the flavor induced by peanuts.

Worth dining at."
"I've been here once now. Love their sushi. Have also tried the set dinner - quite decent. The variety of kdimsums in the spread was great. Some people might find the decor a little gloomy but I personally loved the combo of gold and brown. Overall, a nice experience."
If ure in phoenix either shopping or watching a movie and in for a fine dining restaurant this place is worth taking a pick. It is quite steep in terms of price and hence i said fine dining but if u are a sushi lover this place serves quite an awesome spread. Had the californian maki roll in salmon and shrimp and it was excellent. Then to check whether its really great the best way is to try the veg sushi as if this is well made it speaks of a great chef. Ordered the californian maki roll - cucumber and avocado and also the cream cheese asparagus roll and it melted in the mouth. Such excellent flavour i didnt need to eat anything else but just to taste we tried the nasi goreng which was...read more
"Visited for lunch since was in the area.

The ambience is decent, if a bit dark...can't complain about it. The seating is a bit separated, which is quite uncommon is Mumbai restaurant...which are jam packed with tables/chairs. A 90s actress, whose name I have forgotten was sitting right by us...she still looked glamorous.

The menu was super long and I went with the safe choice of Chicken in Black Bean Sauce and some Veg Fried Rice. My friend got the Mixed Veg Stir Fry. Chicken was a bit too MSGd up for my liking...especially since I had not had any Chinese food in a few weeks. The Veg Stir Fry and Fried Rice were decent...although nothing special enough to write home about.

I was a bit...read more"
"The review is based on 2 visits to Asia 7, both of which are forgettable.

POSITIVES:
1. Quantity of food - The portions were large enough to surely satisfy most diners

NEGATIVES:
1. Menu Choice - While the restaurant claims to be Pan Asian restaurant, the menu is restricted by Chinese and Thai dishes. There are a couple of other Asian dishes represented but nothing to claim its Pan Asian status.

2. Quality (Taste) - This is an area where Asia 7 needs to improve majorly. Its dishes were inspid and without any flavors of the orient showing through. We had ordered Corn and Chestnuts Dimsums (Starters) and the Vegetable Meal in a Bowl (Main Course). The former was alright but the later...read more"
"Went for dinner with family last week. This place is situated beside food hall at Palladium.

Positives:
1. I was impressed by the service. It was prompt, servers had very good knowledge about everything on the menu card.
2. Live Sushi Bar.

Highly recommended -

Fresh corns and water chestnuts tossed in chinese wine and oriental herbs. This one is delicious. Even a hard core non vegetarian like me loved this one as a starter. To go with this would be the prawns in laksa sauce. This was is steamed prawn dim sums in skewers served with laksa sauce. Its a mix of sambal chilli paste and a rich coconut gravy. A portion has 7 pieces. The chicken satay comes close after. This one comes...read more"
"Great food and amazing presentation. Went on a weekday for dinner so it was easy to get a table. The menu has all that you could ask for when you think of south Asian cuisine. We ordered for Indonesian noodles, mushroom garlic fried rice and mixed vegetables in basil sauce.
I have had this kind of cuisine at various places both in India and Singapore but I must admit that this was the best. Can't wait to go again."
"My Best friend, Shefali is down from the US for her annual holiday. And the decree is clear and undisputed, food to satiate the stomach, and gossip to satiate the soul! There is just so much to talk, when 2 women meet, and good food and drinks, just works as the best catalyst!
Try it sometime with your BFF, am sure you will all agree. Girls also DO like to party and have fun!!!!
So what else can satiate women? o come on, this is a no brainier ! SHOPPING!!!! With the sale season on, not indulging in one self, is blasphemy. A couple of hours of shopping, we trudged our way to the 3 rd level of Palladium. Quite some options to choose from, we settled in for Asia 7.

Hmmm, I quickly fished...read more"
"I remember the very quite and uncomfortably non-conversational evening for dinner at Asia &.
God grace the food, the topic of conversation was a lame 'blah food, blah, blah...""

After having been as indecisive about a particular restaurant visit, in the whole bunch at Palaldium, we landed at Asia 7. An voila, in the scantily lit restaurant with equal scarce of diners, a brightly lit bar started right as us. of course the company demanded a demure behavior so leaving aside the inviting bar, we sat for a quite dinner at a diners table.

The food choice and taste to come were just amazing. a choice of dumpling basket with soups and favored noodles were amazing and are still beckoning for...read more"
"the first thing that catches your eye when you enter asia 7 is the ambience. asia 7 located inside palladum at lower parel is mid sized but the interiors are spacious and not crowded. comfortable seating and nice lighting set the mood for the food that follows. first up, kung pao potatoes, impeccably done with just the right amount of spice and the potatoes weren't stodgy or overtly starchy, nice crisp exterior followed by a fluffy smooth interior. next the squid rings, this wasn't a mere dish but an experience, the squid was fried till crispy on the outside, but not rubbery or chewy, the squid meat was soft with just a slight hint of resistance, this is one dish i'd be happy to eat every...read more"
Decent did but very over priced
"Wanted to be generous with the rating, like their portions :) ... No, they're not as huge as 5spice, but they don't have to be.
Never had a bad experience with the food here, or the service. and we come here often, so that's keep-it-up good. We're not fussy about the variety on the menu, although there's decent variety and new items added often... As we sit here, there's a sushi counter and a dimsum feast going on. Music's kind of funny.. Playing manic Monday is too far from East as can imagine.
Fact that I'm writing all this while having a conversation and doing a little looking around doesn't speak much for the waiting on my food.
Foods almost here. Ta

"Great Service. Very generous portions. All round great Asian food, but not singularly stand out. The Mushroom dishes are quite amazing"
"This place does serve the best Asian food, love their assortment of vegetables. Even being a Non-Veg lover I never miss their crunchy mushrooms that they serve with chestnuts and a few other vegies. Just delicious! Price wise its a little expensive for the quantity but worst, considering the Freshness and variety!"
"Even though it has been over nine months since I had a bite at this restaurant, I somehow cannot forget the taste of their sushi. It is terrific. Most of their starters and main course - the rice paper rolls, spring rolls, hand tossed noodles, Thai curry etc are pretty good to taste as well. However, I can recall the dimsums being hard and cold when served. Even their tofu based dishes were a little hard to chew. For the desserts, they do not really have most of what is mentioned in the menu card. I remember it not being a 'sweet' night.
For the ambience, the spacing, the design...all goes along pretty well. It is an organized place and I didn't feel overwhelmed with the crowd. Oh, the...read more"

I tried veg. stir fry noodles and was simply great. It did not taste too blend and was perfectly cooked. The staff was very helpful and nice. Would surely have a second visit there to try other cuisine. Would recommend veg. Eaters to surely try Asia 7.
"Absolutely brilliant khowsuey, was amazed with the taste and quality of ingredients used, will visit soon again"
It was a sudden urge that made me and my friend to visit this restaurant at the corner of the mall and to my knowledge i was speechless about the service and the food that we had. Especially the wet towel that was presented to us was so unique in its kind and it took us with surprise. Basically it was in the form of a tablet that was kept on a ceramic bowl and service personnel poured some water on it and suddenly you could see the little tablet getting formed into a wet tissue. But any way you need to be there to experience though the price is high but its ok for a one time investment. Try it out friends you would surely like it. Enjoy.
"We lived in Hong kong for many years and find Asia 7 a good place to go for reasonably authentic sushi and dimsum, whenever we miss HK Chinese food. Their Burmese Khao Suey is pretty good too.

What we love is their faultless service with a smile. No matter how busy the restaurant, the waiting staff are always attentive and pay attention to detail.

Its definitely on the pricey side but worth it for a treat or special occasion."
"Every time I felt like eating Chinese there was invariably a friend in the group who said he/she had a bad stomach.So i finally went managed to get some company to head over to Asia seven after all this time and delighted I was. Decided to go for Lunch and you instantly want to go to the place the moment you read Pan Asian and a good looking restaurant with a soothing ambiance and decor.we were a group of 7 and were escorted to one of the round tables for a group (any day better than the std boring ones at other places ).

Pan Asian means we were spoiled for choices with the extensive menu as the place is supposed to so we decided to go for the 4 course fixed Lunch Menu for a decent price...read more"
"I had never thought of actually going to Asia 7, though it was always there. After a night at the Comedy Store though, it was the only place open, so we decided to give it a try. The ambience was nice enough, all goldens and browns with a nice live sushi counter and ""make your own wok"" a la All Stir Fry at the other end. We got ourselves a circular table, and immediately appreciated the advantage of the restaurant having placed spinning countertops at the center of the table. More places should do this!

"Asia 7 claims itself to be pan Asian restaurant which serves cuisine from countries across the Asian continent. They serve Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Burmese, Indonesian, Korean and Vietnamese cuisines. Yes, they do have numerous dishes which spread across these cuisines and that too with enough choices for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
The ambience of the restaurant consists of soft lighting and candles on the table.

Closeness of the tables will make you feel that you are eating at a community table rather than a restaurant. But four seater tables and a few...read more"
