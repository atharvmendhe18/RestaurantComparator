"The food and service here is exceptional. I had Prawn chilli and chicken 65 for starters and they were just amazingðŸ¤¤. The Kebabs are also a must have here. 10/10 would recommend new madras, be it delivery or dining."
Chicken biryani with raita & Chicken Ghee Roast with Neer Dosa was delicious everyone on the table loved it.
"This is undoubtedly one of the best experience in causal dining in the area,It has excellent service, the staff is extremely polite. I have heard about this restaurant from many people and they have all spoken just positive stuff. It is also at a convinient location and easily traceable, last but not the least the food feels like heaven on earth the chicken Biyani and butter chicken is just heavenly"

would love to be back and try some of the other dishes that are on the menu."

"Everything we ordered was super fresh. Paneer pakoda was cutely cut in triangular shape served with green chutney.. Full swaad!!! Chicken crispy was awesome,juicy chicken marinated well. Also the gravy had a very good taste. Chicken biryani has authentic flavours from South. I had got little bored of red biryanis. This biryani turned out to be something different in taste, having aroma of whole spices. Tasty super yum dinner from them. Thank you team."
New madras has best panner tikka masala. The masala dosa of them are grest in taste. The ambiance is good. Nice place to visit with friends.

Good ambiances and good food quality you will get here..good place for hangout with friends over the weekend..quite reachable and very close to Sion station.. Fish cuisine is too much good you should always go for it.. Chicken starter are tasty I like the most from here
"Food is excellent especially Sea Food...Must try Andhra Chicken Chilly,Andhra Prawns Chilly,Neer Dosa with Chicken Masala & Bombil Fry. Enjoy The Chill Draught Beer."
Food and service is good.the only restaurant serve drought beer in sion. All is reasonable price. Their buryani is excellent. Not expensive must try.
"I am kicking myself for not going here earlier. Been going to Modern and Sion Lunch home for eons. Always say this place and never stepped in. Suffice to say its now my go to place in Sion. The availability of alcohol is a definite plus. This is what guys like Mahesh, Apoorva and ilk used to be. Great mangalorean food alcohol by the quarter. Anyway onto the food. The Chicken Ghee Roast is the best I've had in Mumbai. The diced chunks ensure better marination and great flavor through. The only downside was that the chicken was a wee bit rubbery. The prawns masala are great but the prawns seemed a bit chewy. That's the only reason why I removed a half star from a 4.5 rating. The mandeli fry...read more"
"Been here several times with my mates. Often here when we are all brooke as its a pocket friendly resto bar.! Awesome draught beer.

They have non ac on the ground floor and ac on the first. Have always taken a seat in the Ac section.

The service here is quick. You can get all the chaknas u desire for. I love their green chutney. Have it with potato wafer or chakli. My best chakna.

For their crispy chicken is great. The quantity is alot. Easily suffice for 3.

Dont even think twice for main course. Just order their butter chicken. One of the best ive had anywhere. I bet you wont b dissapointed. Also the quantity is good for 3. Couple of occassions i was excited for the butter chicken...read more"
"Go here to have the kingfisher pitcher
Good food
Try the pepper chicken Chinese style
Must try - CHICKEN GHEE ROAST
Prawns gassi and neer dosa is good
Good service
Decently priced alcohol"
Been to this place many times.. Cheap booze and food.. Must order : Chicken tandoori and butter chicken with butter roti and Kingfisher jug.. pretty light on your pocket..
"Poor services, poor quality of food and there is nothing to mention about taste..

Food:
We ordered, chicken manchow soup (average), Prawns chilli (good) and Chicken Handi with butter naan (below average).

Service:
Service was too fast that even before we complete our soup , starter and main course came..!!
Hospitality is not so good."
"New Madras is opposite Sion Lunch Home near Sion Station on the main road. The place looks like any other South Indian Restaurant. The interiors are old and tacky. The overall atmosphere is like an old rustic watering hole. There are ac and non ac sections with cramped up seating arrangement. 

Chicken Ghee wala is an amazing dish which I tried on the recommendation. The tender and juicy Chicken chunks roasted in spicy masala with generous amount of ghee. Chicken Biryani was good and had a spicy punch. Also try their fried fishes, especially Surmai Fry.

They also have draught beer pitchers and towers. It is a good place to have a drink if you don't mind the ambiance. Prices are very...read more"
"Went here last weekend for lunch with friends had their chicken biryani which is must have , and crispy chicken which quite good too
Overall a good place to eat at"
"Visited this place with friends had a very good experience enjoyed eating tandoori chicken, triple Szechuan fried rice,Sukka Chicken,Neer Dosa,pomfret fry,Crispy Chicken & Draught Beer Towers.
Will definitely visit back soon.........."
Probably the only place in Sion that serves draught beer. The place is priced decent and is pretty close to sion station. The seafood is good and so is the south indian fare. Chicken Gassi and sukka are must try.
"Had a very bad experience today at New Madras, Sion. Real experience in service level in a restaurant is only experienced when there is a dispute on quality and you want to return something. Well here was a mug of draught beer! It was completely flat and tasteless, when I received it. From the first sip I raised objection and kept it aside and asked for a simple can of beer. When I finished with my food, to my surprise the beer mug was present on my table as well as on my bill!

The owner was shamelessly asking for Rs 65/- to be paid and refusing to let it go despite of seeing that beer is not consumable at all. The staff as well as the owner were arguing as if (I am newborn to the world...read more"
Worst lunch I ever had. In the name of briyani they some rava made rice mix.prices are exorbitant
Serves draught beer. Good value for money. People share table here and I think it is a quite a feeling. But you get over it as you can focus on Draugt settling down. For to know the place while going to Pune .. waiting for the bus.
