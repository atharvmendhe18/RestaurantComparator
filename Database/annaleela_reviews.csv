"A very good place to have dinner. Very tasty food.
I loves chicken tandoori the most. Triple fried rice is also very very tasty. The quantity of starters must increase. The main course gives justice to the price. The quality is enough to fill your tummy and the food is yummy. Must add more seats so that eveyone around is comfortable. I loved this thing the most, they let us cut cake of one of my friends birthday and they provided us with knife and later distributed into pieces to us. It was very kind and sweet of them. A very good place to have dinner
Eveyone must try 😘
Thank you 🖤🖤"
"The ambiance is good enough for family
Good service 👍
But the taste I didn't like as it was like below average..
Tayse can be better if they try hard"
Amazing place to visit with friends and family and also the place has a very friendly environment and all the staff are very welcoming 😊 . The food served is delicious especially the chicken lollipop 👌. Had a great experience 😊

"Annaleela is a very nice place for family and friends for dinner or birthday party, the ambiance is very nice, the service is also given properly, they server quality as well as quantity food, one off my favourite dish from annaleela is chicken crispy, its a very nice place 👍👍"
Good budget restaurant for thaali.
Annaleela is a good family place. Recently ordered Veg Biriyani which was accompanied with Raita and Pappad. Biriyani was not up to the mark and could have been much better.
Annaleela is a perfect for dining. The food was very tasty especially the paneer tikka masala was very very tasty. Would definitely recommend this place.

"The place is amazing for ordering from zomato and even for dinning in,it's simply blissful!!
We ordered the kebab platter,veg triple schezwan rice,murgh masala and naan and have to say,all of them were pretty good,
We had actually gone for the apple chicken which seems to be pretty famous,but it's wasn't available at the time we went but other than that,the place was amazing
The staff was polite and recommended good options as we're were a huge group and were confused on what to order,it was really sweet.
The vegetarian options were pretty good as well,would recommend the paneer Tikka!!
The place is quite beautiful and really nice to visit,would visit again and recommend to friends!"

Paplte fish fry was okay
Biryani was okay
Chicken lollipop - had jeera( cumin) in it , really didnt like flavour
In all below average
P.s uncle was super sweet and kind i gave 1 star for uncle he is above 50 and he still works with smile on his face 🙏🏼"
"I visited this place with my family and had a good time.
When you are around Marol area and wants to eat good food at reasonable price then this is the best place.
Variety of food at a good price."
"This place is close to my office, and it serves multi-cuisine vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Being only vegetarian in the team, had ordered for dal khitchdi. Packaging was good and was delivered on time. It was hot, Quantity wise pretty good enough but i felt bit of watery (liquid form).

It is a lovely venue to host your near and dear ones. This multi-purpose venue is ideal for both social and corporate gatherings. Various functions such as pre-wedding functions, anniversaries, birthday bashes, and cocktail parties or business meets and corporate luncheons."
"Pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem.
Food-
The food was good. Ordered malai kofta along with chapatis and a chicken starter. Took some time to arrive. Starter came 5 mins before the main course. Kofta was creamy and the curry just sweet enough. The chicken chilly was nice and tender with enough spice. 2 stars.
Ambience-
They have a very nice wall art going on and paintings covering some walls. The place has Air-con as well as normal seating depending on your preference. 2 stars.

I got a delightfully cheerful server who was friendly and suggested the right things. Very helpful. 1 star.

Overall- For a restaurant hidden off of the main road, this surely was a great experience. Will...read more"

Prawns chilly- which tasted really scrumptious . The prawns were quiet big in size and were fresh. This was perfect choice of starter to begin with!

"Just a regular food joint, serving standard items.. I have tried a variety of dishes via home delivery.. Nothing stands out and nothing is disappointing as well... The pricing is quite good and quantity too."
"I Love this Restaurant.  in Less price you will get good food.Service is good. they have good taste in Tandooris, . I tried almost all Tandooris here, but don't go during Festivals, like Eid, Deepawali, Cristmas,  as during these days there use to be much crowd and you will get worst services ever."

Food is Ok but service is pathetic. Food doesn’t come for long after ordering it. It took 20 mins to deliver Chapatis and the staff is very arrogant.
"Annaleela is one of the best hotel in terms of pricing and food taste. Their food service is pretty fast and the food is tasty and full of flavours.
Dishes tried:
1) Prawns Koliwada: Nicely fried prawns with shezwan chutney and the prawns are crispy.

2) Chicken malai kabab: white chicken kabab with green chutney is so tasty. I would recommend you’ll to try it out.

3) Chicken manchow soup: The soup was full of flavours and had minced chicken filled in it. Every bite had minced chicken which was the best part.

4) Chicken biryani:Chicken biryani was very tasty and mouth watering.

2) Fish thali

Total value for money as portion size was good."
"Being a Paneer fanatic, and an even bigger paneer pulav fanatic, I can be downright obsessive about the right paneer pulao. I can be specific about the rice, the paneer and even the spices, and the magnificent thing of all this is I get to have my favourite Paneer Pulao here."

Service is bit slow and staff needs training to manage during the rush time."
"No courtesy for online order.
Manger has no manners
Reason for cancelling order is delivery destination is Far.... Which is not their concern as zomato will pick up and drop the order... It was matter of 1.5 km
Ghatiya service"

"Quality of food is not good. Ordered their panneer tikka masala today for lunch. In addition to being and bland and quite tasteless, the gravy felt very heavy on the stomach, even after 4 hours post eating (probably cos of the baking soda and/or food colouring). Safer to stay away..!!!"

The ambience of this place was really good to see and enjoy.

3)raita: it was unique to taste."
It was great experience at Annaleela hotel at Marol. Good food and pleasant place and most importantly its pocket friendly. I would highly recommend this place to people near Andheri
I visited this today with my family this not firsto time for us. But today they had cross the limits. We order one chiken starter and the waiter promised me for 15min max and the dish serve after 1hr of break. And you knew what is wow things 'chiken thanda tha'. Even this I manage cause I regularly come here. And the twist main course 'murge mussallam' the dish was serve is half of the regular quantity. When i noticed and tell him what's wrong the waiter was there is party going on above level of hotel. I was like 'boss I'm also the customer. Even you have to serve me the correct food'. I just say give me the bill I'll go. Again disappointed that they didn't sorry for that. Even they try...read more

"A nice family restaurant with good interior decoration and ambience. They have an A/C and a non A/C section along with a banquet hall for functions. Coming to the food, they have a great menu and a variety of dishes, for starters we had ordered Fish fingers, Paneer crispy and a veg manchow soup all of them were lip smacking, for the main course we ordered butter roti with paneer tikka and dal tadka with steem rice, the paneer tikka tasted heavenly with butter roti, the tadka to the dal was so good we couldn't resist sipping it from our bowls that we finished it up even before they served us the rice.

Overall the food was good and the staff was helpful.
Overall ratings: 4/5"
