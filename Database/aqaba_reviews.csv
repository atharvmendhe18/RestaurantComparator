Review
Loved the food. Had a decent salad. I would say this place is better for lunch than dinner. Staff were nice. Good for getting together with friends.
"2 experiences of this place on the same day - lunch & dinner. Lunch was a buffet. Limited spread but good tasty food. Dinner was ala carte. The starters were good especially non veg platter. However, they don‚Äôt have Indian options for dinner.
This Restuarant is located within Peninsula Business Park."
"Lovely place!Had ordered greek pizza and canelloni pasta,which were delicious.But the spicy feta cheese with pita bread is a must must try.You would definitely want to order more of that pita bread:)"
"When you not having your lunch on time then it may harmful for health but at the same time if you having your lunch late with this kind of delicious and satisfactory magic platter @aqabamumbai it surely give u happiness from heart.

In frame:
1- Mazze platter
2- Aqaba special sandwich
3- Baklawa dessert- Best ever

The Spinach stuffed cottage cheese was the highlight of my visit. It was so soft it melted in the mouth. Risotto was amazing. For dessert do try cinnamon apple pie. It was freshly baked and so soft to eat. The cheesecake was out of the world. I never had a cheesecake like this before. Will be visiting again for more cheesecake.
"Went for lunch on weekday. Quite huge place in Penninsula, good option for quick lunch. It has both buffet and Al cart option. As we were 4 of us we select Al cart option. We decided to try different cusions so we ordered following items:
Minestrone Soup
Cous Cous Warm Salad
Contadina Pizza
Aqaba Mix Grill (Veg)
And for Dessert Baklava

All items was just yumm‚ù§Ô∏è, Planning to visit again to try some non veg itemsüíïüíï"
"Food: 4/5
Service at the table: 3/5
Management: 1/5
Had made a reservation through Zomato. Arrived to find that I am not allowed into the restaurant itself, but was being guided to what looked like a small conference room converted to a dining room. No windows, no sunlight. No view. I was hosting a client for lunch and couldn't change the venue after getting there in the middle of a workday for both of us. I was told that it was because the restaurant was booked for a private event (saw some facebook event for creators). But this is plainly unacceptable."
"Perfect place for a weekend brunch!
It‚Äôs quite big with a beautiful decor
The unique part was there was DJ even in the afternoon
Food turned out to be delicious!!
Absolutely loved the place and definitely worth visiting again

"Visit Day Date and Time:- Friday 26-October-18, 1.30 pm

‚ÄúAqaba‚Äù located in Peninsula Business Park (PBP) of Lower Parel was on my bucket list since long time and finally decided to visit it last Friday with couple of office friends for lunch.

Being lunch time, the place was filled in by PBP crowd and we got our table after 5mins of waiting.

Ambience:- Its spacious outlet with comfort seating options and nicely decorated.

Menu:- Overall the menu offers various cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Mediterranean etc. They also have buffet option.

Food:- We tried out following from the menu:-

This John Dory was out of the world served with assorted stir fried veggies,tomato puree and risotto."
"Tasteless food.

The fish was stale.

The lamb was chewy and lacked salt.

The service was ok. Was decently busy with the office people from the same compound. Without them it would be empty.

The only good part was the beer.

Wont go there again."
"Visited this place with a friend on Friday and we were blown away with everything, from the ambience to the food and the service, they all get a 5 star rating from us. We ordered the mezze platter and calamari for starters and both were out of this world. This restaurant serves the best hummus & babaganoush I have ever had. Main course was delectable and lip smacking. We ordered the John Dory and pollo aristo which were both beyond delicious and absolutely superb. Every thing was made to precision and perfection. Will definitely recommend this restaurant for a lovely and memorable meal and will definitely be visiting more often."
"First time to Aqaba and it was everything that we needed for a quite evening with good food & Ambience. From the decor to the service, it was a pretty good experience. Our attendant, Pravin, was well versed with the dishes and kudos to him for recommending the Babaganoush which was amazing!!! The Italian sausage pizza was great along with L.I.T. and the beer. However, the fish (fish & chips) was way too crispy and could have been better. All in all it was an evening well spent at Aqaba!!!"
"Resident doctor from TMC. We had our ISTSCON 2018 grand dinner here, and the food was absolutely amazing. The staff were courteous and the ambience was just.. perfect."
"Best place for corporate lunch meeting..! No other restaurant can beat Aqaba when it comes to a peaceful, hygienic, delicious and well lit beautiful restaurant. 
Aqaba's corporate lunch buffet is aptly priced and adds value to your meeting (if accompanied with clients). Various sections placed with appropriate gaps which does not disturb while discussing important deals or even conversation with your loved ones. F&B service staff is extremely professional and well versed with menu (buffet/a la carte)
Buffet spread is nicely designed and ample options for Vegetarians & Non Vegetarians."
"Happen to visit this place for the Fifa World Cup final match.
Nice place to hangout with friends.
Food and food choices are good.
I loved Owl beer they served.
Ambiance is great. Good service."
"Delicous food, one of the few places with great middle eastern foods. Limited indian choices but whatever they serve is tasty. Great ambience. Only issue is location being at most crowded place of mumbai."
"In buffet they don't hv bread only thing they are serving is breakfast bread and salad, no vegetables nothing else. And charges are 785 Rs dam shit and manager is arguing that that's all we hv"
"Absolutely horrendous food..in the name of lebenese cuisine, they are serving appalling food which is barely edible. We are convinced that the chef has no idea what Lebanese food tastes like & is probably milking guests who have never tasted lebenese food. The attitude of the staff stinks..we were served an incorrect dish which was blamed upon us. We were initially charged for this incorrect dish & the staff kept insisting that it was our fault ( maybe this works with other guests, but not with someone has spent half of his life in the middle east & is well versed with the different dishes of the region). Overpriced, tasteless, inauthentic & shallow is how I would describe this...read more"
Visited this place last night for Belgium vs France World cup match. With its huge projector and amazing vibe it was surely the right decision to come here. I ordered a Margherita pizza and some fries with tap beer which was all lovely. I‚Äôll surely visit this place for another match.
Nice place... Good ambience...and simply love it's discounts and happy hours... Must visit place specially if your office in lower parel and you looking out for peace of mind with colleagues...among a long list of restaurants in this locality...
"Aqaba is a restaurant located in Peninsula Business Park which is very close to my office. My visit here was during a farewell that we were giving to our fellow colleague. Upon my entry, I was honestly mesmerised by the place. The restaurant is huge! They have two different sections- one looks as a fine dine while the other one gives a more casual vibe.

Coming to what I ordered, I was there for a pretty short while so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to eat a lot. I called for one mocktail- the Orange and Basil Mojito which is the best mocktail that they serve. It is very subtly flavoured and they can customise it according to your wishes too. For appetisers, we called for the Mint Cottage...read more"
"Went here to watch Spain vs Portugal ..One of the best places to watch World Cup matches... Mr.Aaryan is one the best server at this place ..Go as per his suggestion if you are confused ...Hats off to Mr. Rana, one of the senior manager and a true gentleman .... 5 stars only because of these 2 people....Cheers !"
I watched the screening of the Germany vs Mexico football World Cup here. While the match was disappointing the food was just the opposite. The chicken tajine was amazing to the taste and it‚Äôs aroma took me took me on a trip to Morocco. The falafel Schwarma was crispy and fresh. The Italian chocolate biscotti was good too. The Tiramisu though was a bit disappointing as it was tiny and tasted more like a blackforrest cake with a hint of Irish coffee. Overall the ambience is premium and the service is prompt. We had a great time.
"Phenomenal food and service. The manager who took care of us was one Mr. Virat Singh - he and his team did a fantastic job for us. We had celebrated a birthday last evening with about 20 guests. We ordered pizza, pasta (Alfredo) and fries for kids, and Shwarma (paneer), pasta (pink sauce), salad, humus/babaganush for adults, and drinks (iced teas and beers). Everyone had a great time. Before organising this party, we were very worried after we saw the old reviews but our experience was completely different - Mr. Virat has put all concerns to rest. Lot of attention to detail paid by the restaurant. I would come back here again in a heartbeat. I just hope the restaurant continues like this."
"Aqaba one of the hidden gems based out in Peninsula business park. It has dim lit ambience with courteous staff.Visit this place between 5 - 8 pm to avail the happy hours offer on drinks. They have a wide range of cuisines ( Greek, Mediterranean, Italian and many more ).

"The Biggest disaster from our end taking this venue for a party.
Service/food PATHETIC
Attitude of the main Chef - NOT acceptable ( guess came out of the Kitchen to give explanations ) with some kind of Freshner chewed in his mouth which is banned in Maharashtra ..  a guess maybe i am wrong ( normally i am not )
No coordination among the team when one had 30 guests for dinner. 

Quality of food was pathetic.

I have been to this place more than half a dozen times but this was a nightmare.

Labneh - runny ( no texture ) cannot be called a Labneh ( learn the basics chef ) 

Hummus - Grainy extra garlic killed the texture and balance of Tahini and Olive oil . In short very...read more"
"The place is located at P5 of Peninsula Business Park. Got a bit lost finding it but the martials at peninsula were so good that they guided me to the place.

The food here was superb. The ambience is also good. Polite and welcoming waiters. Had ordered for a BBQ chicken pizza and the paneer Tikka. The paneer was soft and the pizza was perfectly cooked.

Overall Good place for a calm and quite lunch"
"Overall I had a great experience in Aqaba.

Food: The menu is not extensive but has a sufficient amount of vegetarian as well as non vegetarian dishes. The 0.5 extra in the rating is primarily due to the food, which was great. We had a non-veg mezze which worked out perfectly for two. Every single item we ordered was tasty - the kibbeh, shishtouk, fries and meat, the italian dumplings and the greek quesedilla. The garlic aioli and pita were to die for.

Ambiance: While it was quiet and spacious, the lighting was a bit low for my taste. But good space, has a lot of potential.
Location is perfect - right in the middle of the business district.
Service: Please go with time to spare, the...read more"
"Aqaba gains itself a constant crowd owing to its location in peninsula business park. I visited this place for their corporate buffet a while back . For the price, the buffet was extremely average and I would rather go to a bbq nation or global fusion. I guess this makes sense only to the occupants of the building it is located in else it‚Äôs too much effort for nothing really."
"Aqaba based out in Peninsula Business Park on the 5th Floor, is a hidden gem of opulence in area cramped eateries in Mumbai.

Dim lit & romantic ambience with extremely friendly & warm service staff.

Their cuisines range from Greek, Italian, Mediterranean, Moroccan and many more..!

We ordered the Peach Iced Tea & Fresh Lime Water both were very-well made..!
Hummus which seems to be their specialty..too

"Another restaurant in Sea of Hangouts at lower parel.. and even this lives upto the high expectations..
nice place to dine if you are with family or a business delegates.
good ambience .... and they have a huge terrace which I assume might be giving it just for parties.

Well we started with soups.. ordered tomato basil soup .. it was very delicious.
next was a cous cous salad ü•ó .. it was very amazing ..my first try with salad meal and was definitely not disappointing.. we further ordered .. broccoli with humus pita and pizza .

"Having lived in UAE all my life, the basic garlic cream was an absolute disappointment. I couldnt believe I paid 150INR for a tub of garlic mayo. This is basics of the cuisine that you are specialists in. Garlic cream also known as ‚ÄúTOUM‚Äù is a speciality just as hummus is.
The corn seekh was also quite disappointing, maybe because it was home delivered. It was very dry.
Packaging was classy."
The ratings are a not fair. Really good food and great service. Justice to what you are paying for. Fact that they allow kids post 7pm is a great bonus.
"It's a decent place that you can go to when you don't want to think of many options.

Food: I've had the buffet a couple times here, which often involves cold yet good food. Among the √† la carte menu, hummus and forgettable chicken skewers of a kind have been tried. They pretty decent.

Service: Service is also not bad, but nothing special. The servers keep their distance yet are available when you need them.

Ambience: It's on the 5th floor, faces a mini lawn, and invites a good amount of sunglight. It's a semi-formal brunch place, with spacious interiors and nice decor.

Price: A bit on the expensive side, of course, but it's a pretty standard rate they charge for such places.

"The first thing that catches your eye as you enter Aqaba is the naturally lit casual seating ambience. This place is in one of the biggest corporate parks in Lower Parel, which is a big boon for the working population there. A sit back and relax kind of place.

I went to this place for a lunch date. Having never heard about it before, I didnt know what to expect. We started with Adsorted Mezze Platter. It comes with a choice of five dips. All of the tips tasted delightful. However, Tabbouleh stole the show with its fresh ans fragrant flavor. I just wish that they served more pita bread instead of just four small pieces.

Love Aqaba for its vibe and ambience. The rich selection of wine and starters does set the mood right for the evening. A must visit in the pleasant weather

"After being in Middle East for years, you do develop a taste for the authentic food. Tried the shish touk, Jujeh kebab and Shwarma.

Didn‚Äôt find either of the above to be authentic. Probably a poor attempt to suit to the local palate."
"Had been here on new year's eve. Surprisingly it wasn't like the other over crowded parties. Good music and enough space to dance without bumping into other people. The fine dine experience here is also really good. Good food and a lovely place.

"Went here for the buffet dinner ! The food is not outstanding but a good choice if you are in Lower Parel ! There was a vast variety in the buffet ! There was chicken shawarma,there was vast variety of gravies and desserts too ! Not reasonable at all but it's ok for a 1 time visit !

"Was here for a party after work...the ambience is really good !! There was a wedding going on out in the lawn but that didn't hamper our experience. The staff is really good and polite. Now coming to the food , I'll have to categorize it in two parts good stuff and stuff to avoid-
Everything Lebanese and middle eastern on the menu is must try , a special shout out to the shish taouk which was really good and so was the hummus.
Avoid the Italian because the pasta red and white and the pizza were a let down.
The baked cheesecake was really good !!

"Have you ever been to an Airport Lounge? If your answer is no, then head to AQABA.
We were around 30 of us and went there for a team lunch. When you 'zomato' the restaurant, you will be glad to see a rating of 4/5 and the expectation immediately soars.
While the place is actually a 4/5 for ambience, seating, service but the quality of food on the lunch buffet is extremely unappealing. I keep travelling for work very often and the moment I picked up a plate to grab food, the food items, taste and the serving table - everything reminded me of being at another airport lounge.

We called for spinach and cheese stuffed cottage cheese kabab, asparagus, sun dried Rissoto and traditional greek pizza. All dishes were v flavourful and delectable.

"Fantastic way to celebrate Diwali New Year with family.
Greek fish broth soup set the evening with a light but flavourful start. Hummus with Shrimp mezze was fantastic- great hummus with soft pita bread and delicate shrimps vanished as quickly as they were served.

"Even as you enter the Peninsula Business Park, you know you have stepped into another world. Aqaba has a separate elevator, that sweeps you up straight to the 5th floor. The lobby is imposing, with 3-floor high ceilings and really tall chairs. Aqaba has a fantastic ambience, with excellent decor, and even an open-air seating that looks over a huge garden.

"Went here last night to celebrate my mother's birthday.. Surprisingly very few people for a weekend..

I've been here before and had only veg food at a party.. Excellent.. Everything was event.. So expected a lot from the non veg food..

Great ambience.. High ceilings, well spaced tables and comfortable seating..

Service was excellent..

Food.. Overall not at all a bad experience.. Though I'd like to have a few more options in the mains section.. That aside.. Brilliant food and presentation..

1. Moroccan prawns-- soft, succulent well cooked and fill of spices and flavors..

2. Joojeh kebab-- by far the best dish of the night.. Amazing cook on the meat.. Tasty and more..

3. Hummus with...read more"
"Amazing ambience. Gives feels of a nice upclass fine dine restaurant, but not so fine. Vibrant pop music but not too loud. Delicious food. Great service. And cherry on top, prices are on the cheaper side.

4 mains
Pitcher of sangria (5 glasses)

"Had lunch at Aqaba. Firstly the ambience is cool n pleasant very airy. Now coming to food,Amazing Mediterranean food.Had the non veg platter which was generous serving of chicken lamb and fish.The service was fast and the food was lovely.The pita bread super soft.
We had the cous cous salad and minestrone soup. the soup was amazing and served in no time.Althought the salad had a little too much vinegar for my taste..In all a great light and yet filling lunch just how Mediterranean cusine is supposed to be."
"Lovely food, great ambience, revisited turkey with Aqaba food, great staff , can keep going there again and again, continue the hard work and market the restaurant well.... disha"
