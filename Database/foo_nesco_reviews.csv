Review
"The food quality, taste, packaging is good. But the portion size is extremely bad and less. Not value for money!"
"All the ordered food items were delicious, service was spectacular and ambience was very aesthetic. Our server- Rohan was very kind and we were gifted with a complimentary birthday delight for my daughter as well."
Vikas was guiding us for the dishes and he was really great in recommending the dishes of our taste. Very nice ambience and great service and yummy food. Must visit to make up your mood and ask Vikas to attend you for better recommendations. Vikas you were great in hosting us. üòäüòäüòä

"All dishes should be labelled, especially the Sushis. You label the sauces that accompany the main dish, but don‚Äôt label the main dishes !
So 1 Star reduced for that.
Also - Tom Yum Fried Rice is very different from the last time I ordered. No taste / flavour of Galangal/Lemon Grass, no spice etc - this felt like some normal chicken fried rice with excess lemon in it. Major disappointment. Will not order this again.
Rest of the food - awesome as always. Hence the 4 stars."
It was an amazing experience and service by Akshay was too good while giving the best recommendations!
amazing food. wonderful service by Vikas and Shanku. Its a must visit restaurant!

"I had made a prior reservation at Foo Nesco for 9:30pm on 17/02 Saturday and got my table confirmed. Since they work in 2 slots 7:30 and 9:30 we took the latter. And I was there right on time, to my suprise the hotel staff greeting me told me that my table was still occupied by the people in the previous slot and told me either I‚Äôll have to wait 15 to 20 mins or start at the bar. We decided to accommodate this as we were not sure if we‚Äôll get a table somewhere else on Saturday.

Again no prior intimation or call was made to me informing about this. It was 9:50pm and no one approached me yet with my table so I called out for another staff and they told me the table will be ready in...read more"

Food was completely messed up. The main essence of ordering sushi is its arrangement. This is more like khichdi!
Sauces from gravy spilled inside the container. Bad packaging
Connect with Sai Prasad there for quick tips on using Chop sticks.. he hosted us for the evening .. his suggestions were on point.. felt just like a wow
Foo crispy wantons were a delight! Blue rice is a must try... The ambiance was perfect for date night... Service was great and Rahul was very friendly and helped us with our order.
Received just 2 pieces of dumpling despite paying 150 extra for additional portion
Saiprasad is an amazing host. He listen to you and suggests you great food as per your choice and also surprised us with lovely dessert.. love the food and hospitality.Joy

"Loved the food here, especially the Sesame cheesecake desert. Thank you, Rohan Colas for the lovely service and food recommendation."
"It was a over all great experience, food is good but what‚Äôs cherry on top is the staff, the lady managing the reservations was so polite and helpful. And the food severing was done by Rohan Colas and he was so helpful and explaining the menu and suggested the dishes which we enjoyed a lot"
The ambiance is stunning. The food here absolutely stunning and the staff is very hospitable. Akshay catered us during our meal and he was extremely warm and friendly and helped us have an amazing meal. Cheers to the whole staff in making a great experience.
"I frequent this place and I cannot forget the service Rohan spoils us with. We luckily visited on Chinese New Year and tried their festival special cocktails Yin and Yang and a pandan flavoured Lunar Luxe tequila drink was as fancy and luxury to the tastebuds. savoured many festival specials and crispy Snapper with black bean sauce was homely and kickstarted the magic of Foo. the sparkle on the Hongbao chicken dumpling another festival special was a representation to its taste, miso chili chicken, their garlic fried rice never disappoints with a added seafood in abundance. Rohan surprised us with mount Foo-ji making it the best dining experience
thank you immensely."
"I would highly recommend Foo if you‚Äôre in Mumbai and craving for Asain food.
They have got wide range for vegetarian options too. Sushi and blue rice is a must try. Good presentation was unexpectedly brilliant!!

Staff and service is good and Akshay was very helpful"

Great service, nice hospitality and good demeanour by Rahul"
Great food and even better service by Rohan.
I have been a regular here and Akshay and Rohan are fantastic staff. they are friendly and have the best suggestion with food. I always end up asking them 'kya acha hai' and they give the best recommendation. I was not that into South East Asian cuisine but the food here is unbelievable. my complements to the chef as well. you make food with love!
