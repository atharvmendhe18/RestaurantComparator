Despite requesting specially it was still spicy
didn't received hummus with pita bread with the order
"Humus is not supposed to taste sweet. If they can fix that, they might be able to sell a proper Arabian meal."

Ordered from chillies after a really long time. Only the soup and naan was worth ordering. The tandoori was okay and quite dry. The rogan josh curry was 50 percent oil and 50 percent curry. The oil was so much that it looked like a packaging of heart attack and disaster.
only chicken bones no chicken pieces
Very less portion with higher price. Should be in plastic container. No tissue and cutlery
Delivery Boy took 2 orders in one time amd delivered us after 1 hr of order.

Ordered chicken tikka biryani from this place. The biryani was so delicious and would surely like to order from this place again. Meat was so juicy and flavourful. Loved the food.
