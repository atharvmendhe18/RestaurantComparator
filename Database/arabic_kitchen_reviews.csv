Review
The food is amazing especially the burnt garlic rice and cheese fries. For some reason people are demeaning this place. Try for yourself and it'll be worth it. Atleast that way you'll have your own opinion to trust and not someone else's.
mutton khichda is like staled dal rice. there is no mutton in it. just loads of curry pata. salt is too much. most disgusting food ever.
"Please save your money and don't order food from this . My worst experience so far from any restaurant. food wasn't good nor was it delivered on time. Shawarma was cold by the time it reached my place and not worth it at all. Genuinely, I would like my money back!!"
the food was not delivered on time.
Not recommended for Shawarmas. Mayo was used instead of hummus!
"food was great, delivery was before time"
very good
"Not upto even average mark. My dinner ended in a disaster. I ordered Romali Roti, Naan & Chicken Masala. Romali Roti was like some Poratta. Very failure attempt from the chef. Naan felt like tandoori roti. About Chicken Masala, it was too salty. They should delete this items from the menu or should change the chef. Only good thing was the chicken pieces in the curry was good. Zomato should not allow such restaurants in their app."
shaerma was very sweet.... not worth it
How cAn zomato allow a cheap restaurant like this. Half cooked and third grade food they served me last night
very bad tasting shawarma..
Its tasty! But inform them to improve their hygiene!
"Not even worth giving them benefit of doubt!
Since the name is Arabic Kitchen, placed an order for chicken shawarmas and fried rice. 
First, they didn't confirm the order for 10 mins-it was placed through food panda, had to call them to check if they were accepting it or not.
Second, the order took more than an hour to get delivered, when we tried calling them, the number was switched off.
Third, the pita bread and the chicken in the shawarmas were stale, the bread was so hard that it was difficult to even take a bite. Fried rice had no flavor what so ever!
DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE, they are not even worth a try!
A huge mistake!"
not time to deliver
awesome food.. just loved it
"The service here is very slow, have ordered 3-4 times from here, takes quite a long time to deliver even a small order. Also they had made wrong food item delivery which they did correct later."
Horrible service. They keep rejecting your order. They don't seem to be interested in serving customers. They should might as well shut the place down.
"I can't give rating in negative otherwise I would have rated them -10000000000000

Most pathetic food
Order online just 3 dishes.. N they took like 2 hrs to deliver and on top of that the food was so very bad that I don't have words..

I will never recommend anyone to order or eat at this place..

Is there anyway I can get my money back???

Dear zomato.. Kindly remove this restaurant from the list.. Or at least cancel the online ordering system for them

Thanks"
"Good food is fast delivery The food is very good cleanliness
Biryani is very good ! All the food in the Arabic Kitchen is good the food is much more"
"Ordered for two shawarmas. Explicitly mentioned no beetroot, but they sent it with beetroot. No Problem. Called the restaurant and told them of the error, and instead of apologising or trying to correct it, after 30 seconds of silence i recieved the reply ""Sir dekha nahi hoga"". I told him I do not eat beet root, again silence for 30 seconds till i said 'Hello' and again i was told ""Dekha nahi"". I had to literally tell the person on the other side of the phone to send me another order to which I got the reply ""Abhi chalega nahi? "". Would you ask this question if you sent non veg food to a vegetarian too? Finally after demanding for a fresh order without beet root they sent it but this is...read more"
"Good stuff . Food has a nice Arabic touch to it. Ordered
Chicken soup - Nice Arabic tasty touch to it
chicken shawarma - Nice and big, sauces were good and shawarma was quite filling
Chicken seekh biryani - spicy and aromatic flavours
Chicken cheese kebab - this was the only dish I didn't like dat much, it was a strict ok

Overall I found the food worthy of the price and satisfying😊"
Over charging and trying to justify as machine entry error. On debating about over charge accepted lower price advertised in price list distributed. Will never order again
Excellent food....turns out to be a better joint compared to other food joints who have been around for quite a while...always delivers food hot...and really happy with the quantity....
had order mutton khichri and it was delightful. the only reason i am giving this rating is due to the price as compared to the quantity. they should either increase the quantity or reduce the price.
"There is shawarma and then there is the crap that these guys serve. As audacious as they can get, their chicken shawarma has no veggies... Not one bit but instead has French fries... Dastardly soggy ones and a teaspoonful of chicken (Ab chicken shawarma Hai toh... That much they have done). In an uninspiring mayo to bind. As far as Arabic food goes... Guys your shawarma is an embarrassment. There is this guy who sells shawarma opposite the waghbill veggie market...his rendition of shawarma is infinitely better than yours... Go learn from him.
Also have had biryani and butter chicken.... Both are strictly passable... Nothing to write home about."
"I have tasted the Chicken Biryani and Chicken Shawarma from this place. Both the items were good but what i found extremely outstanding was the Shawarma. The taste was very authentic, like the shawarmas available in gulf countries. Truly good arabic food.."
Ordered for Kebabs n Biryani. Delivery was delayed by 1.5 hours. Kebabs are unnecessarily spicy. Bit disappointed.. Next time will think twice before ordering.
"Food is good. I had ordered all the non-veg items and all were good. Best part its Chicken Dum (POT) briyani, that is must try if you are ordering from Arabic Kitchen."
Awesome Chicken peri peri shwarma and yummy Chicken Tikka kebab. Good quality n quantity and they deliver food on time. Friends do try once.
"Superb food...It ws a get2gthr and v had ordered White Sauce Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Shwarma and Chicken Biryani. Tandoor was best, Chicken shwarma tasted just perfect and Biryani was authentic... will surely keep you guys busy by ordering more..keep it up guys and will surely recommend all to order from here."
"I ordered the food from here, for a change.I like arabic cuisine, and i ordered shawarma from hear and it was not so good in taste. I had also ordered kadhai chicken and it was having a little bitter taste. The humus_pocket brd that was a little good then other things. But they dint gave me in one go, i had to ask for that.
I dont recomend this restaurant to others as you will waste your time and importantly waste your money.
Dont try this at all."
"Ordered from Arabic superb food ... List of things which I tried
1. Seekh kabab Roll in rumali roti yummmmm.. :-)
2. Chicken tava gravy and kheema with Rumali roti
Must try
3. Chicken tandoori in white sauce superb.
I would really like to try few more thanks for the awesome food Arabic kitchen."
"Terrible inedible food. Not at all professional and I felt cheated. Same order tastes different every time. There were hair in the Biryani. Not at all recommended to anyone. I could make out that the shawarma roll was made in a hurry by mixing all the remaining chicken in their kitchen-Chinese, Indian chicken all mixed with terrible sauces- just because their kitchen was going to shut in half n hour when the order was placed. The same shawarma roll tasted different last time I ordered it. The delivery boy- both times that I ordered from them this week- did not carry change. The chicken Biryani had hair in it and was inedible. Terrible terrible inedible. I will never order from this place...read more"

Beautiful shwarma and chicken biryani. The amazing taste of the tangy chicken and the long grain basmati rice is just an amazing combination to add to it fried onions! Loved the biryani and the shwarma was full of delicious creaminess
AMAZING is the word...the chicken biryani and mutton tawa masala fry were very flavourful and rightly spiced...we even got a complimentary gaazar ka halwa which was again vry delicious...will definitely order again!👍
Awesome chicken shwarma cheers for arabic kitchen ordered peri peri shwarma super duper taste my 10 year old kid really loved it we also ordered tandoori awesome taste will surely order again
"Turned my idea of a shawarma on its head. Wish people would stop destroying a dish which is completely fine in the name of customisation to suit local palate

Ordered Chicken Shawarma. Short review. In spite of asking for the dressing being hummus, got a spicy tomato sauce. So strong that it completely overpowered the taste of the chicken."
Too good seek kebab's and tandoori in entire hiranandani estate it was a family function so placed ordered they delivered on time plus awesome tasty food one should try seekh kebab rolls
