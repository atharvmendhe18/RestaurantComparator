Too salty
""
packaging is not proper. the quality of paper container is very weak so the liquid gets leaked out. must use good quality containers. rest is all very good
The was no to very little salt in Chana Masala due to which it tasted bland.
""
Ofcourse this place is awesome and still continues to be awesome. Maintaining your legacy well. Special mention in desserts: must try the churros
Has a very wired texture and taste
""
Love New yorker
""
There was no chocolate sauce in the hot fudge. I have. Ordering from New Yorkers for years but now will order this only with Gianni as their sauce and nuts are decreasing and this was like a plain vanilla ice cream with a few nuts.
i had ordered Masala soda but instead they sent me ready made cheap Jeera Soda.. Cheats..

Loved the peri peri fries ‚ù§Ô∏è
""
It tasted really baad and did not even looked or taste like an enchilada
""
""
""
it says 2 pieces of enchiladas on the menu as per my order but I was sent just one piece.
"instruction not followed.
I had asked for seperate sauce but it's on the icecream.
what's the point of fudge sauce if not hot.
looks unappetizing too."

"Dry oily & stale no flavour at all, Worst chole eaten in entire life"
"This people are cheats! They dont send your complete order! When called them and asked for refund, they dont respond."
Weird smell from the enchiladas
""
"Surprisingly, Nachos was very heavy on the stomach."

cheese not good
I still remember going to newyorkers as a kid. Staying in suburbs we all the way used to go till there to enjoy the mexican food and we used to find it worth it! Sadly now things have changed. The quality of the food has deteriorated so much! Had ordered big bang nachos. The salsa sauce was spoilt and cheese sauce was too watery. Nachos were cripy at all. It was disheartening tbh
There was no cheese ON the enchiladas
Issue raised.
order arrived cold

Pizza was too cold
"Not worth the money
First, the crust was thin, they should highlight that. They just sent pizza without checking out the ordered & pizza was bit on sweet side.
Not that great taste"
On the menu it's written 12 pcs but I received 6. please look into it.
"We have loved the food from New Yorker for more than 20 years. We have never compalined. Unfortunately, today both the dishes we ordered, we very different. Tasted sour and not freshly made. Sad‚Ä¶ but true."
No spoon. Rice was mehh!
