"Lovely ambience ... at entrance it was mention 10% discount so we dont want to miss this opportunity .. had beer and chicken dum kebab ... good food, great service with discount"
Good ambience considering that this is not a family restaurant... Nothing extraordinary but does a decent job. Please note that there is a dearth of quality non veg fare in Ghatkopar as its a gujarati area.. If you crave seafood then head to Santosh Lunch home near Vidyavihar station east... Sadly this place isn't listed in Zomato
"Good food for a good rate and best thing is that they deliver till midnight. Sometimes they deliver later than that but only to really nearby areas. Tried the Chicken Handi, it was delicious! The meat fell right off the bone and the gravy was not swimming in oil and it tasted rather fine too.
Tandoori rotis need a bit of work but average overall."
Great drinking exp after renovation. Greater ambience very good service. Soooo best........................................ .
