"the pasta waa bland I had requested to check the salt n they ended up not adding salt rather missed adding oregano to the pasta..this time was disappointed.
good thing is they followed my instructions of adding brocolli n mushroom to the veg Alfredo pasta"
superb... I am a fan of prithvi cafe
"I never ate such a bad pav bhaji. I had huge expectations from Prithvi cafe because of its name. Taste was bad... I felt like they gave me yesterday's remaining, reheated bhaji."
chicken croissant stuffing was ðŸ‘Ž

Forgot to send the dip

The spaghetti was too dry . The sauce was less with the result that it was not creamy
"The chicken was smelling bad
The brownie was too sweet to consume
The taste is below average

Quality and quantity is not worth the price"

It was veg Pulav rather than a Egg Biryani

"For a brunch, dinner or lunch experience please visit prithvi cafe they have a huge variety of things to eat at an affordable rate I love their pastas, red velvet cheesecake brownie and their hummus with chicken"

Cold food

My delivery was delayed and the pizza i have received is completely cold.
The food is always fresh and nice. No extra spices & oil.
Everything was perfect except the restaurant sent chole instead of dal makhni with the parathas.

order delivered too late... cheese and bhaji was very less
""
""
I ordered it late night at 11:30PM. Still delivered. Great quantity and definitely worth more than the price. Comes along with a nice papad with salad. Curd rice tastes absolutely great and packing is very sturdy

chole quantity was less.
"Really bad quality food.
The pav was not toasted.
The Bhajji was liquidy

Please report.

The food is inedible"

This pathetic paneer butter masala roll had no butter and no masala. Just spoiled onions and spoiled paneer. Had to throw it out.

"Recently visited this very popular cafe near prithvi theatre where i tried:
1. Cheese Paneer Kulcha(4/5): Taste was it was just osm, cheesy & flavourful. It was served with raita, achar & chole. Chole was homely & raita was thick. Pricing is bitter in higher end. Rs.250 for 2 pieces.

2. Chocolate Crossaint(5/5): Just Rs.70/-, flaky, chocolaty & super fresh. Must try.

3. Cafe Mocha(4/5): Decent, chocolaty & good on pocket. Rs.100/- for a medium sized cup."

didn't enjoy the sugarcane iced tea...it tasted nothing like sugarkane. and the portion of bread in both dishes were SO LITTLE. i had to place an order from a restaurant nearby to quickly get more pita/bread.
recd bottle in open condition and half empty
"everything was great. only issues i had were:
- cheese Paratha didn't have enough cheese in it, especially in the entire outer part of the Paratha.
- bbq chicken puff was SUPER oily. enjoyed it, but the excess oil got me nauseous

overall great. literally just ordered again right now from your cafe."
Black dal was bland and chicken had over masala
