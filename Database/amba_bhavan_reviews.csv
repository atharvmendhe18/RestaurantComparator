Review
Terrible. Indefinitely waiting. Lack of organization. No queue management. Sexist team - maybe give it a try if you‚Äôre a guys only group. Wouldn‚Äôt eat here if you paid me.

Came to this legendary restaurant which was started in 1935. The owner is extremely humble and they are the second generation running the restaurant. Their filter coffee is an absolute must have. I had two cups :D Pineapple sheera was average. I would come here for the filter coffee and the old charm feels! Looking forward to trying the other food items as well I have heard that their chutney is really good.
"Visited this place on a Sunday morning after my darshan at Kochu Guruvayur temple.
Located just next to the temple on matunga station road this place is a pure bliss.
No fancy seating, No over the top menu or price
A pure simple, elegant hotel run by brahmins I guess ( seeing their veshtti)
We tried Masala dosa, puri bhaji, ghee saadha dosa , idli vada plate and one vada sambhar
All were Ek se badhkar Ek üôåüôå

Usually in South Indian hotels serve the chutney which is chilled like straight away taken from the fridge.
Here they served freshly made green chutney which blew us as if we are eating from our home.
Finally ended up drinking super filter coffee.

Had Ghee roast/ Sada Dosa and Medu Vada from here. Everything tasted nice and was crispy as well. Even their sambhar was not sweet like in other places. Their tea however was not really good. A good place to have quick South Indian snack.
"Tried lemon rice as I wanted to stick to trying something very simple and authetic south indian style.
I have tried lemon rice multiple times in the past and have always enjoyed it unlike this one.
Rice quality was thick and even the flavour of lemon was somehow too pungent."
Heard a pretty good word about them from majority of the people who have been here. But purely going by my opinion I found it average and a bit over rated like many other restaurants in the matunga area. Snacks are fairly priced and good for a quick bite.
"Tastiest south Indian food around matunga. By far the best crispy Rava dosa, rasam vada and mysore sada dosa are must try dishes from menu. Rasam vada was exceptionally soft yet tasty. Neer dosa was very nice.
Place is pure south Indian brahmin eatery with no onion and garlic dishes mostly but onion uttapa is available. Sambar is a different , some may not like so much thick sambar. Chuttney is great. Overall it was a great experience to visit Amba bhavan."
"One of the best and oldest restaurants situated on the highway of matunga.
No fancy seating, very simple decent staff and ambience that believes in serving home style and wholesome food.
Pipping hot and fresh.
As they were not serving any kind of dosas on the day when we visited so can't say anything about it.
But would highly recommend you to try their kadi vada it's the best i had till date üëç
Vada sambar was also good.
Freshly brewed filter kaapi is a must try.
Very reasonably priced.."
Went to this place yesterday for breakfast after Sunday long run. I ordered wada sambar and buttermilk. Food is very tasty and amazing here
"Amazing authentic south indian food place. Limited menu, right in the heart of King circle on the station road. Simple old decor, comfortable seating. Good sized portion. Taste still the same over years. Nothing fancy about the place. South Indian food lovers a must visit."
Kadhi Vada was Yumm....liked the way the filter kaapi was served in a very traditional way.... :)
""
"While on the way to work happened to see this place and it took me not a minute to decide i am ending my hunger with some delicacy and filter coffee which i saw on each table.

Trust me the decision was worth it.

I have always been fan of such places which take you down years back with their ambience and traditional service, neither do they fail in delivering taste And authenticity they are known for years.

One of the best filter coffees i had so far. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and try other things with must have filter coffee."
"excellent coffee and the dosa was super crispy , chutney tastey and perfectly spiced and the sambar has the right amount of sourness . The staff are prompt with the service, it is an authentic joint so you wont find the plastic service with a smile here . I had a peek into the kitchen and omg it was cleaner than my house kitchen , so impressive
One can always tell the quality of the food by a mere look at the kitchen .A must visit"
"Small place but not as crowded. Your typical udupi style restaurant so food is served really quick. The prices are cheaper in comparison to others in the area. Filter coffee is way better than the others I've tried in matunga. The vada was good, idli was OK."
"A small joint which gives you a feel of a typical south Indian eatery of 90s. The dosa is good but the idli wada is average, so is the sambar. You may have to wait for quite some time on a holiday to get in. The service is nice and so is the manager..Typical no frills restaurant."
Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning.. serves almost the same stuff as it‚Äôs more crowded peers in Matunga. Great food! Recommend the pesarattu and the filter coffee!
"I was in the Matunga East area and attempted to check out the iconic ‚Äòcaf√©‚Äô around the periphery of the Maheshwari Gardens. While there are so many deservedly good things said (and experienced) at this place, I have not been lucky on past several occasions to revisit this place ‚Äì it is either closed or full. Be that as it may, I walked around the corner and discovered the Amba Bhavan Coffee Club.

The place is as spartan as it gets but it reminds one of the typical south Indian restaurants that operated in the area decades ago. It clearly had nostalgic value. Hard to rate the place from an ambiance standpoint because places like these are meant to evoke memories; ambiance takes...read more"
"We absolutely love the hot coffee and the super soft idli here. You cannot miss the upma here, it was literally melt in mouth. Don't shy away to order extra sambar and chutney because they are really tasty. Great food and pocket friendly too."
Good food and efficient service wrapped in an envelope of old world decor and charm. Recommended if you are looking for a no frills authentic South Indian meal.
"This place does some justice to Southern Indian food, I particularly liked the Dosa's as they were made and served in their original form (South Indian style)"
"Again a south indian restaurant based in matunga. I am not a big fan of this place but I love love their sambhar. Its the most authentic taste among all restaurants in the vicinity. Staff is simple and courteous. Do visit if you are looking for tasty sambhar.

Tried kadhi vada and uttapam as suggested. It is the best you can find in matunga.

Cheers!!

I will give it a 3.5/5"
"Authentic to the T , the food is simply simple sounthindian . They have been serving since decades . Humble and polite , small place with limited menu ."
"Amba bhavan is an old, simple and quite popular restaurant in Matunga. Its my favourite of all south indian restaurants mainly for the taste that hasn't changed over the years and the awesome sukha (dry) chutney [See IMAGES] Even the sambhar is quite good but the sukha chutney is one of the best ‚ò∫Ô∏è compared to any other restaurant.

This review is based on the take away order:Onion Rava ‚Çπ60, and 2x Idlis ‚Çπ40/plate, and of course, alongside the sukha chutney. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Both the idlis and the crispy onion rava dosa are absolutely fantastic. Its also one of the few affordable south indian restaurants in mumbai.
Other must try items are Pesserate dosa, Onion Uttapam, Filter Coffee and...read more"
"One of the mist authentic South Indian food in Mumbai. The staff is amazing.
Krishna one of them is a great human. The owners have excellently maintened the food quality"
"I believe matunga is a place where you get the best varieties of South Indian food in mumbai. Nthg can beat that. Amba Bhavan is one of the reasons for that legacy

Simple hotel simple furniture simple people n simple but taste village style food is what you get here. U wd see strangers sharing a table with you if the seats are empty n dats completely fine as you yourself are enjoying your food here.

Idli, wada, dosas, Upma, sheera etc all items are good n if very good quality and taste. The bhaji of masala Dosa is awesome in taste n bit more gravy which adds to the taste. It‚Äôs some of the rarest place where you get authentic food tastewise n quality wise."
This is a good place where you can enjoy with your family and friend. The taste of dosa is very good. Waiters are very polite and they provide a good servise.
"Was near the Kings Circle, thought of trying the food here, I like their Bissibelle Bhat, Kadhi Wada, Mysore sada dosa, didn't try their idli-wada though, also, do try their filter kaapi(coffee). They do need to some good cutlery though."
Good place for breakfast. Old style ambience. Good south indian food. A bit delayed services on Sunday mornings due to huge crowd. Overall a thumbs up.
"South Indian restaurant where our waiter flatly turned down our breakfast order for a Sada dosa saying ‚Äúit will take too long so no ‚Äù. This was at 9 30 on a Sunday morning! Tiny hole in the wall place, hot and stuffy, lousy food, terrible service .. best avoided!
Since madras cafe and ram ashraya were packed we went with the Zomato rating and headed here. Bad idea!!! High time Zomato stopped forcing paid food blogger reviews down our throat and instead showed us ones from genuine customers!
Third time I‚Äôve burnt my fingers! Next time am definitely ignoring those who have 500+ followers and give 5‚≠êÔ∏è ‚Äútoo good to be missed!!‚Äù...read more"
Worst place to eat.sercive is very slow and not up to the standards. They will make you wait to even serve water.Staff is also arrogant and not responsible.
"The moment you enter this humble establishment , everything turns black and white like Raju Rastogi's house in 3 idiots and you are teleported to a coffee outlet at the corner of the street in Madurai back in 1964. This feel is surprisingly pleasent.
It's a quiet and simple place with no hustle bustle most of the times.
And as one would expect , it serves the typical south Indian menu.
‚úìNo complains about the idli , dosa and medu vada. ‚úìSambar and chutney are far better than it's thriving counterpart Ramashrya.
‚úìAnd to end it , yumm filter coffee.

Overall , a satisfactory and cheap alternative for some south Indian food cravings when rest of the outlets in matunga are crowded with...read more"
"Although the service here is fast, with above average food, they lack on ambience - place needs refurbishment definitely. Visit if you need a quick South Indian food. I tried Idli and Vada here and they were above average but as compared to many other outlets they are lagging behind in the food quality."
"superb varieties of idlis, fast service and above average ambience.

try Kadhi wada, Dip Idli Sambhar, Rava Sada, Upma, Filter coffee etc..

they serve excellent chutney and sambhar with all their orders.

big outlet and particularity and discipline very amazing. 
they dont have table for six and many times you need to share the table at times.
Parking is task so manage vehivles and enjoy the moments as if you are in Southern part of india."
"Yes, yet another classic place to satiate your hunger for Idli sambar.
I love their sambar and offcourse coffee too.
The restaurant is simple old styled place yet with peace you can devour the taste."
"good food, fast service south indian outlet.

small and below average ambience. taste is average and rate wise slightly cheaper than competitors..

can give a try when other outlets are full with lots of waiting...."
"Best at their place is the filter coffee and Mysore Sada dosa. They put green chutney in Mysore sada rather then the orange one which other restaurants put. Sambhar has a manglorean style as they add coconut in it.

Decent place with limited options"
"Don‚Äôt judge this place by its ambience, ignore it for a while and place your order. Well, if you are not sure, start with the ‚ÄúMumbai ka worlds best‚Äù üòÄkadi wada. The service here is average so is the quality of tableware, but not the taste. Don‚Äôt leave this place without having their ‚Äòfilter caapi‚Äô."
A simple and sweet place with limited south indian cuisine...very close to matunga central station... the taste was good....the only thing is that they provide sambar and chutney in a very less quantity which is really insufficient...and when you ask for more they charge it...this should be improved!!
"A good place for authentic South Indian filter coffee and quick munch. The ambience is very nice, with a vintage look. We had kela bhaji, which was good, with delicious sambhar. However, the coconut chutney, which used to be superb earlier, has lost it's charm, with lots of chanadal diluting the rich taste and flavour of coconut. The filter coffee was piping hot, awesome and refreshing. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable too. All in all, a good place to catch up on a quick bite and a great cup of coffee."
"After trying at least couple of Restaurants in and around the vicinity, I personally feel there are much better options than Amba Bhavan. And this I would say purely on the basis of taste not caring about the ambience. I found this place pretty average and nothing great... try other options instead."
"This is by far the most South Indian joint on the circumference and vicinity of Kings circle where lies the kingdom of udupi cuisine.
With a really homely atmosphere and not much visible renovation since it was built, this place has a peaceful aura that's just so comforting! The staff serving you roam around in lungis and are really friendly people!
Studying in UDCT, I've scoured the lengths and breadths of Matunga in search of a place like this, humble and simple yet so lavish and amazing in its own way.
Don't be fooled by it's extremely humble exteriors or interiors for that matter. Just know that the archaic looks signify the time they've been around doing what they do best, slaying...read more"
"Ok food, fast service, below average ambience.

Although it is cheap but only recommended if you want to have a quick bite and nearby South Indian outlets are full..

Place needs refurbishment immediately.

Idli sambhar and upma is very nice."

"An highly underrated South Indian restaurant. One of the best I have ever been in and has surely become "" a coffee club"" amazing hot and steamy idlis in the morning . Known for it's upma and a treat for all coffee lovers to try their filter coffee.

Personal favorite - mysore sada , idli , filter coffee without sugar , rava onion , upma Must try"

"Hi all,
Went to this place today around afternoon time.
It was less crowded as compared to myaore cafe and ramashraya.

Ordered idli wada sambar:-
Nice soft idli made from rawa and medu wada soaked in sambar was served hot.Taste wise it is still on par with other outlets in matunga.
The chatni was a bit ok as compared to mysore cafe.
But the best snack to start off i would say.
Idli and medu wada.

Rawa mysore sada dosa:-
We tried ordering the rawa mysore sada dosa and i must say i was not dissapointed.
It could give very tuff competition to mysore cafe who is famous for their rawa dosa items.
Nice crisp and huge dosa served with chatni and sambar.

"Nestled in a bustling road in Matunga, this unassuming joint actually was a chance discovery. This place is near the temple on the street that also has the more popular Ramashray. On a Saturday morning, this place was bustling with people. The waiters are quick and serve you with a no-nonsense attitude. There is a menu on the wall, which has many South Indian delicacies such as vada, varieties of dosa, sheera (Kesari Bhat for my South Indian brethren) and many more.

Their sambar is very tasty, and not sweet (this is a big plus). However, what won me over was their filter coffee. It was strong, had the right amount of sweetness, and the waiter also does a small performance with the coffee...read more"
"Purely Authentic, with quick service, a yummy masala dosa, Idli-sambhar dip and much more. Always try the sukha CHATNI and the Seera much more........................"
"Today is Sunday. Like our homes, some restaurants provide the best they can prepare in this day. Cafe Amba Bhavan is always been in my favourite list with its Kadi-vada, Goli-bhaji, Rawa-pongal (only on Wednesdays), filter coffee, etc. Today, I tested here Pongal and Black coffee. Both were awesome. Found the best Black coffee in and around Matunga Circle. The cozy ambience of the cafe and excellent hospitality of Narasimaji are praiseworthy too.
Thanks Amba Bhavan."
"A hidden Gem near kings circle that reminds you of old school type restaurants ... service is excellent and food especially the chutney and sambar is better and different than the other joints around... we tried the scrumptious upma, neer Dosa, rasa vada and onion uttappa along with ginger lemon and the filter coffee and non of them disappointed the tongue nor our pockets... do try this place out if you are kings circle."
"A hidden gem in all the South Indian Restaurants in Matunga. Their Onion Utappa is so good, you can't eat just one. Their Mysore Sada Dosa doesn't have the red chutney inside, it's a green chutney & that's yummy to a different level. They don't serve plain coconut chutney, they serve a green chutney which is way better than what is served anywhere else. Their sambhar is also different from what is served at other restaurants - you will either love it or hate it. There is no midway."
"Amba Bhavan was a jewel that I discovered thanks to my brother who told me that once I try the food here,I'll be spoilt for authentic South Indian everywhere else. Having been brought up in Matunga,I fail to fathom how I overlooked this amazing udipi( a South Indian restaurant)! The interiors are untouched and the walls resonate all the history that this place must have witnessed!
I love udipis as they are so unapologetically themselves that they do not care how modern or funky the world around them has become.
Everything that we tried was a sure shot hit and there were absolutely no complains.
We tried sada dosa, mysore sada, neer dosa, meduwada, idli and of course filter coffee and...read more"
"Hello foodies, like most of the snacks corner in Matunga Amba bhavan also serves south indian food(no surprises). We tried kela bhaji which literally had no kela in it only basen fried with green coconut chutney(was tasty) ok then we ordered Maysore Masala dosa it was more like normal masala dosa only but it tasted good on tounge. One should try wada kadi. Service is okay, ambience is also okay."
"Simple yet tasty food, quick service , reasonable rates , old world charm, this is what defines this place great food , simply delicious, South indian food"
"A quaint little place in the busy road leading from Matunga station (CR) to Kings Circle, this serves delectable South Indian fare. Though slightly modified to the varied tastes of the mainly Gujarati and Kutchi communities that reside around, Amba Bhavan still retains authentic Udupi flavours in their food. Service though minimal and as needed is adequate just as their portions. But this is an economical place compared to the better known giants around it.

I've seen this place for over thirty years now, but other than a fresh coat of paint this remains the same... which adds to its charm. Excellent dosas and lovely upmas make this a must-visit eating joint. It's a bit short on space...read more"
"Nostalgia. Used to visit during college years. The food is still the same. Idli, Medu Wada, Masala Dosa, Filter Coffee. All of them awesome and so is the Sambhar and Chutney. Must visit place in Matunga."
"Amazing place for authentic and fresh South Indian breakfast situated very close to King's circle. Traditional setup gives feeling of old charm.

Upma is too good. And so is Idli-Vada. Sambhar-Chatni have a unique taste, just like Sharda Bhavan. Less crowded compared to the popular joints in the vicinity."
"Like every south indian restaurant in the area this one too serves lip smacking dosas, idlis, and vadas; not to forget the steaming filter coffee. Service is quick and the place is actually quieter compared to the others. Less noise= more at peace + more food ;)"
"Decent place nothing fancy in it. Well know place in Matunga. In morning there is no big issue with parking. Test o meterüìüüìübase on my 2 visit..
I order steam idli, kadi vada,Mysore sada, Onion uttapa and coffee. I like special idli and uttapa.
Kadi vada is also decent. But seriously I don't like Mysore sada and sambar test may be I comparing with other hotel that's a biggest reason. But that green chutney is really awesome.
So overall nice place too visit at lest once..."
"Similar to the other popular South Indian restaurants in Matunga, this place has great food, good coffee, really quick service and a very affordable rate. All these things make Amba Bhavan Coffee Club, one of those reasons why Matunga is so famous for its food."
"Growing up in Matunga, Kadi Vada has been synonymous with the best Kadi Vada ever! The coffee is great too! The place closes at 8 pm sharp so go here for breakfast or for an evening snack. And it's closed on Thursday for some reason!"
"This place has been around for such a long time and it does not fail to disappoint me. Today when most of us go to fancy and upbeat restaurants we have forgotten how to enjoy a good delicious really cheap dish.
We ordered a filter coffee, wheat halwa and Upma and just paid 85/- which is absolutely stomach filling and worth the price.
This place has its own rustic charm which no five star with music and AC can ever match up too.
If you are around at matunga please do visit this really gem of a place where the food is absolutely amazing"
"Matunga is full of restaurants that serve delicious South Indian food. All foodies must visit this place for a South Indian food experience on a weekend. This is what we did last week. There are 4-5 restaurants that are the best in Mumbai for Down South Cuisine.

Amba Bhavan was a splendid restaurant that we tried. It's a bit congested. Things can go haywire if it's crowded and one needs patience. Service is normally fast. I now understand why so many friends of mine from UDCT are fond of Dosas and Idlis.

These guys serve delicious Rava Dosa, Ulundu Dosa, Onion Uttapam and Pesarote. You cannot afford to miss these delicacies here. Check out their Kadi Vada, Neer Dosa, Adai Butter and...read more"
"visited the place for a snack and a hot coffee ... loved the coffe .. the snacks was hot and fresh but somehow felt the taste was to my liking .. honestly not bad but nothing to rave about

my recommendations / observations
1. No parking available ... busy road and so dont bother getting your car
2. place is quite old ... seating is surprising decent but decor is nothing to rave about .. quite average actualy
3. Fair pricing
4. Food was fair in taste but was looking forward to something better
5. Coffee was quite good
6. service was fast & courteous

Overall a decent place a meal and a coffee ..."
"This is and will always be my favourite udipi joint in the city and in the world . They have still traditional and the ambience take you back to the 70's . They have not sold themselves out by becoming modern like few other udipi joint around matunga especially like Madras cafe .

Food is spot on , service is discreet and sufficient. If you want a good ,authentic and a unique experience , please try Amba bhavan ."
"If you are a fan of south indian food and filter coffee and a neat simple tidy eatery suits you then Amba Bhavan is just the place. All basic types of Dosa , Idli, Kanjeevram idli , Adai and snacks such as upma, pongal are served apart from filter coffee. Service is quick. Taste is quite good. Would recommend the Adai and Upma and also the coffee. Will make you realise that good looking and stylish premises of restaurants are just farce. Ultimately tongue needs tasty food and stomach prefers simple food to digest."
"I have been visiting this place since ages, may be 15 years now, nostalgia is in the air the moment i enter this place. One of the most simple and the authentic food one can get on a very reasonable price. My all time favorite Ullundu dosa with filter coffi."
"If you love simple, authentic south India food, head to Amba Bhavan! Everything on the menu is a must try. Filter coffee for the tired soul and ginger lemon to soothe the itchy throat :) Eat everything fresh and relish the yummminesss! Himanshu Bhagat"
"This is one of the best restaurants in mum serving authentic south Indian food. The eatery is very basic with no fancy stuff - it's clean, airy (no air conditioning ) and provides good service. The sambar is awesome n so are the dosas (thicker types just as in bangalore ). You can also try their curd rice and medy wada. Finish off your meal with authentic filter coffee or butter milk."
the Coffee of various cities in India. My experience is the city adds its own flavour to the taste of Coffee. For example how coffee. tastes in Bangalore is entirely different from how it  tastes in Mumbai. These two are completely. different experiences. Bhavan gave me the Bangalore experience which is really hard to find in Mumbai.
I have been visiting this hotel since I was a kid. This is a no-fancy place for great south Indian meal or snack. The sheera (sweetened rava)here is great and must if you are looking to satiate your sweet tooth.
"One of my favourite of the many south Indian joints in matunga. Been here innumerable times, just for their kapi. The moment you enter here you will be transported back in time. The old style Interiors of this place have definitely stood the test of time. Their menu is Handwritten on a blackboard. No printed menus! Very limited but delicious items on the menu.
The filter Kapi is the best you will find in matunga.
Have had their rava dosa and masala dosa. Rava dosa was perfectly crisp and golden. The Sambhar is simple and delicious. Their service is quick.
Great Kapi, delicious dosas, quick service and definitely value for money!"
"It is again a Karnataki place which has a limited menu up on the board,with again a back in time nostalgia in the air. I ordered a Ulundu Dosa (urad dal) batter and a filter coffee. No complaints at all."
"Perfect south Indian snack place, continuing legacy of matunga of delivering traditional South Indian snacks. Less crowded and perfect place to enjoy filter coffee in the heart of matunga."
"Small South Indian food joint. Located at King circle. It still has those olden days type of an ambience.

Serves some authentic South Indian food. Steaming hot idlis, vada sambhar and filter coffee are my all time favorite. Quick service and good food. It's another classic ones like others in the vicinity. Recommended."
"This place is for people who are in for a quick snack...
Again an old south-indian eatery..
Quick service and fresh food is what you'll get here..
A very normal place...

A cool , sultry Sunday morning, overcast that you know it can rain anytime soon weather. 

Decided to go for breakfast with friends. Picked this place for two reasons 
one had not been here before and 
secondly the other more 'popular & branded' diners at Kings Circle, Matunga had a 30 minutes wait.

Got a table immediatley so both objectives met.

The place is very basic in ambience with 'lungi' clad waiters. The furniture is dated which is fine by me.  Gives a good authentic feel. Ordered idlis, medu wadas & dosas.The Ulundu dosa was different , do try it. The classic fare one should have such eateries.
