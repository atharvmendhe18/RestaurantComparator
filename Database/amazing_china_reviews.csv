Review
Visited this place on 20th Aug with group of four 6 people we ordered chicken lolypop .mashroom. fried rice and noodles ..lolypop was good in taste but the service is very slow order took almost 45 minute ....
"Amazing indeed! Home delivered good as piping hot, timely delivery. Also, great ethnic taste, not Indianised at all! Subtly oriental, the manchow soup was delectable. :)"
Ordered for chicken chilli noodles meal combo. Order delevered on time. single container with half filled with noodles and other half with chilli. Taste & Quality was good bt the Quantity will not be able to satisfy one's hunger.
"#Amazing China

I have been at this place on Sunday night with my friends for dinner. This place is new one in Todi Mill. Typical Chinese restaurant and yes they don‚Äôt serve dishes of paneer.

Ambiance: The place is tiny that it has 4-5 tables. Ambiance is nice. Walls are painted with blue color.

Prices: Menu is pocket friendly. All dishes are well priced. They don‚Äôt charge any tax.

Service: Service is good and quick. We were group of 10 people so they arranged table for us.

Food: we had veg mayonnaise thread and crispy fried schezwan chilli potatoes. And in non veg my friends had chicken safta, lemon chicken, chicken in barbeque sauce and chicken lollipop in starter. In main...read more"
"Located in a small corner of lower parel. The ambience created is nice but the space is too small, hardly 4-5 tables. But the food is tasty and good. üëçüëç #pocketfriendly #chinese#thaiüëçüëç & yes good serviceüëç"
"This place is good for lunch and dinner!
They serve good Chinese food even the quality is great!!!!!
Very small place with good service......."
"Small place with hardly three tables, average food, not so good service. We were severed with the cold food after approximately 40-45 mins of ordering.
Need to improve in every aspect, especially the food."
"Not so amazing China..!!!

Quantity is not good.Not even a kid can fulfill his apetite.Gravy was mixed/provided in Rice container itself.Noodles and Rice quality is bad.Not Value for money and wont be recommending to anybody."
"Good Place, Amazing Chinese food at affordable price. A must place to visit if you are at Lower Parel. Chicken Chopper Rice and Combination Rice is a must Have."
"Very Nice Food and staff are very co-operative.
Takes less time for delivery will give this restaurant five star,....,................food is very mouth watering, yummy...."
"Good food and quantity was sufficient for two people!!

Was combing through Kamala Mills and Todil Mills for any new outlets, then we came across this outlet. It's near the entry point of the lane towards Social.

They assist you with food suggestion and go with their suggestions as you'll not be disappointed.

All in all a good lunch session.. good food, friendly staff and a smiling owner."
Very much disappointing...bad time management ...bad service .... bad food taste ..... should recommend not to go this hotel ..... stale noodles
"Ambience is good n food is authentic...Burnt Garlic rice, crispy chicken is very tasty ..Reasonable price n quantity is sufficient. Good place for proper Chinese lovers."
"Class as always.. love the kosher food here with different dishes to choose from. There is a lot of variety here and authentic Chinese food.. the cook is awesome here and knows his dishes well.. awesome and friendly staff who are really polite and courteous ..

The owner is a great guy who is always smiling and always there to listen to your suggestions and make the type of dish you want..

Have been here multiple times and surely my favourite place to eat Chinese food..

I recommend this place to all.

Awesome location n great crowd.

Keep it up. Will keep coming back for more.

Warm Regards,
Moses"
"Awesome Chinese food in the town. Had been repeatedly visiting this place. Cool Ambience, tasty food and special mention here for the mint water they provide. Honey chicken is a must try."
"Amazing food as always :-)!!! You can try and explore new dishes here and they will not disappoint you ! :-) take your family , friends & colleagues & enjoy the food !!!"
"Tried chicken in Basil & Garlic sauce, mangolian rice & egg pan fried noodles
All dishes were damm good

Amazing Food , ambience & Service.

Cheers for whole Team"
Been to Amazing China today. They recently moved from to this new place from another location recently. The ambience is extremely good. They have installed AC's so that you can dine in comfort. I tried the chicken burnt chilli combo. Throughly enjoyed it. They also introduced new dishes. An affordable restaurant to eat in with quick service.
"If you u really wanna taste delicious , quality Chinese food then you must visit Amzing china..it has everything..soft n relaxing ambience...friendly staff..Unique n innovative dishes..do visit along with your near n dear ones

PS : no artificial...coloured ingredients in any dishes...

Cheers..Amazing china.. üëç"
"Very innovative food,chinese but no like the regular ones, variety of dishes and amazing taste.A good sevice and nice cozy ambience and a very nice experience great place to visit with ur family, friends or just a special someone."
"If there were a lower grading system, my rating would definitely be in the negatives, but since Zomato doesn't allow me to go below this, I guess I'll just have to be generous.

We were in the mood for some cheap Indian Chinese food, you know, the type that's as tasty as it is unhealthy. Well, Amazing China is absolutely unhealthy, minus the taste. In fact, I'd recommend this for anyone trying to lose weight because you won't only throw up what you've just eaten, but the food from the weekend gone by as well!

Being the Monday after the long weekend, everyone was in need of a pick-me-up. So what better than Chinese food, right? We ordered the Triple Schezwan Fried Rice and the Crispy...read more"
"Working in Lower Parel just got easier because my chinese cravings are satiated at least once a week from here! Good quantity, can work on their barbeque sauce usage though"
"We are disappointed with the service and cooks of Amazing China. Inspite of ordering Veg.Chopper Rice, we were delivered Non-veg chopper rice. The bill also mentions Veg. After complaining and asking for an exchange, they weren't instantly ready to provide an exchange. It took some convincing to get the exchange  food in veg."
Amazing food...... Great taste ..... Good service....In love with food over here..... Everyone should try once....for real Chinese.................
"Amazing china-Small outlet with 2 Tables,Located opposite Kamla Mills gate in small lane ,would suggest to opt for Home delivery rather than dinein which accommodates 6-7 People only
.
Qualilty of food is good,Pocket friendly and Quick service speed

Had BBQ chicken ,Mushroom Chilly

Really liked Notice on Board for Customers-
Save water
We will serve water only after being asked
Order only Wt u can eat."
Superb place .amazing food.thr Gravy lollypop and chopper rice is amazing.well known place in surrounding of kamala mill area.service is good
"My rating was 3.5 but with last visit to Amazing China I would not rate 1 even.
Re-check , re-confirm twice or thrice with the waiters the dish which is ordered.
If you order veg , Amazing China may amaze you by serving chicken.

In my last visit, I ordered for Manglorian Rice (Insisted to be veg) , upon serving the dish we confirmed whether it is veg / non veg, the waiter confirmed veg. While me and my friend started with the meal , I observed something weird (I am pure veg, so I can identify paneer and manchurian easily) and shown to my friend who eats non-veg but that day because of navratri he accompanied me with veg.
He quickly figured out that it is chicken.

When we brought it to...read more"
"A small Chinese & Thai food joint located at a narrow road. Really nice and pocket friendly place for Chinese & Thai lovers.

I often visit this place and tried almost everything at this place. The quality as well as the quantity is absolutely on a very higher side. My experience at this place has truly been GREAT! The food is PHENOMENAL. The veggies that this place are always fresh. The feel of the veggies makes u feel great!

The best choice for lunch when I am at office is undoubtedly Amazing China.

These place justifies & keeps the value of it's name and it's really AMAZING.

Enjoy!"
"Good for lunch at office. Decently priced and the quantity and quality is not bad.
From the looks of the way they maintain the place it seems to be pretty clean and hygienic so that's a plus point."
"Food: Good

A big mistake on their end saw Chicken Noodles being delivered to a vegetarian with the mentioned item the only dish in the order. Poor experience but not fair to downgrade based on one bad experience."
"Ordered home delivery chicken schezwan hakka noodles and chicken in barbeque sauce....
Noodles was gud bt chicken in bbq sauce was finger licking..... really awsum"
"A not so very great experience with the food , had ordered Shanghai Chicken and Honey Chilly Potato.

Shanghai Chicken - Too Much oil and very salty Chicken . It had excess of ginger paste uncooked and hitting the palate complete NO NO .

Honey Chilly Potato - Again Ginger Paste added to excess . This tasted of just potato , there was no Honey or Chilly component to it .

Got the Food replaced to something different , turns out to be decent , the rating for Salt & Pepper Chicken Dry and Hongkong Noodles ."
The place is pocket friendly... Its exactly beside the Lodha building in a small gully... Their taste is really good... Almost 60-7-5 crowd working in Lower parel area has eaten frm here
"Food was gud. We ordered
Chopper rice~ it was really delicious witha large omelet.
Chichek sahat.
Ambience is not for having food there. Its best for home delivery option..dont go there for having food there,best u order and have it."
"It is our regular Chinese ordering place while at work. Just opposite Kamala mills, it is very convenient for me to order from here. It is worth the money paid. Small place but good taste. Request for less MSG and the chef will oblige."
"Quick Chinese affordable place... Almost known to every person working in the kamla mills nd surrounding area... The food here is sometimes frowned upon nt sure y... Got a chance to go here almost after reading about it fr an year... Tried 1 starter and 1 Rice...

CHICKEN SAFTA: Unusual name... A Tibetan dish.. Chicken covered in black sauce.. The chicken ws pillow soft... Didn't expected it to b so good... But turned out to b amazing... Had lots of chicken wid yellow-red bell peppers..

CHOPPER RICE: The rice came out as I had expected. Rice topped with gravy and had crispy noodles too.. But the amazing thing ws a huge omelette covering the entire platter...
Tasted good...super...read more"
"As the name is..same was the food ""Amazing"". From Starter menu, I have ordered chicken in Barbeque sauce, me and my wife loved it. It was very tasty and proper indo chinese style. From Combos, I ordered Triple Schezwan Noodles (chicken) , i think gravy could be much better but apart from that overall this was also good.

so overall, it was good dinner with Amazing China, though it was my first time, but i would love to order again and again. I have never been here but its home delivery service was good and the guy who had taken order was also very patient and have good knowledge of menu, he guided very well.

All The Best!!"
Would have given 0 if I had an option. The service is pathetic. Never ever order from here. They will show delivery time of 45min and deliver after 1 1/2 hrs.
"Reading the mixed reviews, I didn't know whether to risk it or not. But I am thankful I went. I had Chicken Lollypop which was fantastic. For a small place, the taste was fabulous. I then had Chicken Safta. They were kind enough to replace bell peppers in that dish as I am allergic to it. But that dish was so good. Amazing China makes chicken and their outer covering is not as thick as it is in other restaurants. And then finally I had Chicken salt and pepper. I also packed some dishes. It may be a small place but it definitely offers awesome food in affordable prices. Also Amazing China has a ""ask for water and it will be served"" policy. Being an environmentalist myself, I...read more"
"Worst ever experience...they never pick up calls...I have placed my order at 12.45 at noon and still haven't received it...and the person says that it's on it's way...
Would never suggest to order from here..
It's difficult during office hours to again order from a different place when one restaurant doesn't deliver...
In short never order from this place"
One of my friend suggested this hotel....so I ordered from there....I ordered schezwan noodles...It was too tasty....quantity as well as quality wise is also good and i think it's the best schezwan sauce I ever had!..I would love to try rest of the stuff...but truly good Chinese cuisine!
Its a little difficult to locate this small joint as its in a small ally opposite kamla mills. It has only two tables and can accomodate upto 7-8 people at once. But the food tastes great here....specially the non-veg dishes. Incase of home delivery....its good too. The rates are normal so overall its good.
"Very bad experience.. V had ordered veg clear soup, stir fried baby corn in black pepper sauce and veg burnt chilly pot rice. Baby corn was good. Soup was overload of ginger. And pot rice didn't arrived at all. Further d person seating at billing counter was not even aware abt our order. V had to leave wtout having lunch. Service is way too bad."
"Great food great value for money, good service, good quantity, nice people. If u r hungry and need desent food then Amazing china is best option rather than ordering that domino's or zesto's. Also if u need plates n spoons mention that while giving order, they provide for free. :) YOLO"
"When I first saw this tiny place, i wasn't sure whether I should order anything at all. I was about to turn away actually, but am I glad I didn't! I was, well, amazed by the food they served me. The first dish I ordered was Lemon Chicken and that still remains my favourite. In fact, I always tell the person who takes my order to make the pieces smaller, add green chillies and make the whole dish dry. It tastes awesome (it even has broccoli would you believe it?) Truth be told, I am posting this as I am digging into the same dish at my workplace. But today, even after epeatedly telling over the phone, they didn't make it dry. neither did they add those green chillies. And worse, they...read more"
Very bad experience of ordering food from here. Spent 180 bugs for pot burnt fried rice & got a garlic rice kind of food. I asked them to exchange it but they said they can't.. Very bad customer service..
"The hardest thing is to locate this restaurant, as it is located in a small gully just opposite to kamla mills compound..have tried many chinese dishes here, but my favourite is chicken burned garlic noodles which is unique in taste..one small advice dnt order any pot rice or pot noodles here, it is full of unwanted sauces...Overall a good restaurant for authentic chinese food..."
"Work, lunch, zomato, call for delivery, perfect timing, good food, Amazing China sorted everything. Ordered for Chicken Triple Schezwan noodles and seriously it was pretty good from taste to quality it was simply above my expectations. The timing was perfect like 30 to 35 minutes which was pretty impressive. Would surely order from here again and will definitely explore the menu further..cheers!"
highly recommended restutrant in mumbai which is located in the heart of the lower parel they are veyr particular with the quality used in cooking and are very well serviced very highly recommended place
My colleagues from office suggested it..they used to call from here but realized it's near by so might as well go and eat there..it's in a good commercial area but as in a lane n so tiny that it could be easily missed..I was taken aback by how basic n small it was..but again it's proven how small basic places can rock bec their food talks for itself..the chicken Manchow soup was excellent..so was the red pepper chicken and chicken burnt garlic pot rice..if u just wanna eat good Indian Chinese ..fresh n piping hot n don't care about no ac or good decor than do go for it cause it's worth it n bill for 3 people 450 bucks total ..value for money..or can call for take away as well
"Amazing China is a small place table service is good fast I was d only guest wdh my friends we had 2 tables.
We ordered amazing spl soup which was nice it was khause which I love.
We ordered Lollypop Masala Dry which was sweet I dis liked it and Shanghai rice was cool bit not tasty..."
"Called for delivery from here on a weekday and the delivery took less than 30 minutes...however, that good part was kind of compensated by the food. Had ordered veg burnt chilli garlic rice and the rice was cooked perfectly...so were the vegetables in it...however I think the chef misunderstood the dish as chilli fried rice with whole garlic cloves mixed in it...there was no flavour of garlic and yet it took me more time to remove garlic than to actually eat my dinner...
Would order again for the overall taste but will be super specific about such details..."
"Food is quite nice given the rate and location gives an authentic chinese feel while eating.Chicken in Black pepper and Chicken in Garlic sauce is a must to taste if you coming here.
Only problem is the seating space rest everythings fine."
I gotta say this place is probably the best place where I have had Chinese food from since I moved to Mumbai (so far). The food is pretty good and the quantity is just amazing. You get a lot for an amazing price. I ordered food from this place for lunch and it was awesome. The delivery went up to 45 minutes but it was so worth the wait!
"Best place to eat Chinese food  :) Good Quality, Awesome test & good service m loving It :) must go and taste it !!! Because Its Amazing Amazing Amazing :)"
"Opp Kamala mills, in a lane you would find this place . A typical Chinese joint , well the name says it all! Tried their lemon coriander soup and hongkong rice which was good. Nothing extra ordinary . It's very affordable but the food is too oily . Service is ok . Small joint mostly works only on take away ."
"I didn't go personally to this place so I have no idea about the ambience or the atmosphere of the place. I had asked for a home delivery and I found the food to be decent.
The person who takes your order down is nice and knows his stuff. The food was delivered within the promised time and was hot.
The chicken salt and pepper was good but the Thai curry was not tasty at all. The ingredients were all over the place and it just didn't taste like Thai curry."
"As it's always said ""Great Things Come in small packages"" Here's a classic example to best prove the statement. Had heard a lot about its authentic taste and quality and I wasn't let down. My lunch here today was an awesome experience especially the lemon chicken and chicken safta was outstanding. The blend was amazingly accurate. Keep it up ""Amazing China"" Hope to visit soon."
"This quaint Chinese joint serves food true to its calling- Amazing! Chilly garlic noodles and vegetables in hot garlic sauce (lots of exotic veggies like brocolli, colored pepper, etc) is a perfect meal for me.

Additionally, my husband, who is a non-vegetarian, is a die-hard fan of red pepper chicken. 

All in all, great  food, good quantity at absolutely affordable prices"
"Amazing China - A Hidden Paradise For Chinese Food lovers!!!!

Amazing China is the best place i have lately been exploring almost every weekend and i must say it serves really good Chinese food!!!

Amazing China is a small yet very cosy restaurant right opposite Kamla Mills, Lower Parel!! It serves authentic Chinese dishes which beats the taste of any big restaurant you'll come across in south Mumbai.

We had tried many dishes right from Chicken Safta, Lolly Pop, Chicken Manchow Soup, Mangolian rice!!

Every time we come to this place, we get literally lost in the most delicious and tasty dishes served by this Restaurant!!! It's extremely affordable too and  you will be pleased with...read more"
"Amazing China must be the smallest dine in restaurant I might have visited in my life. Locating this place might be difficult for some as its in a small lane bang opposite Kamala Mills in Lower Parel.

This place has just 3 tables. Yes you read it right just 3. Expect waiting for sometime if you are visiting this place during lunch time.

The food is quite decent. Have tried the Manchow Soup, Veg Manchurian, Veg Fried Rice and Schezwan Fried Rice.

They don't serve water until you ask, is their policy as they believe in not wasting water.

Amazing China takes order via Whatsapp also, but I would recommend calling them to order your food as its much faster.

"Yesterday night I ordered from this place for the first time purely basis the reviews, rating and photos on Zomato (which I now believe to be paid reviews). Two words to describe my experience: UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.

THE ORDER:
I had ordered the so-called-famous chicken Safta along with chicken black bean and burnt chilly garlic rice. All these dishes were suggested by the order takers (I wanted to try their best dishes)

THE SERVICE:
Overlooking the fact that they took more than an hour to deliver from Lower Parel to Parel, on arrival the food was already leaking orange oil from the plastic bag and was dripping all over the containers which were already soiled.

THE FOOD:

"Hi Foodies.. I have been patronising Amazing China since a Couple of months now. It is as the name goes an amazing place to dine. Raphael, the owner is quite a jovial guy who is open to feedbacks. Although a small place, but the quality and the quantity of the food speaks volumes. My personal favorites have been the Amazing China special rice, chicken safta, chicken satay, chicken lollipop in gravy. You can ask Raphael to make a particular dish as per your taste, and he would oblige. One of the most important aspects of this place which brings me here almost everyday is the taste of the food which is highly consistent and the hygiene maintained unlike other places in the vicinity like...read more"
"The food here is great. I have tried the Triple Szechwan rice, Dry Manchurian, Szechwan rice and the Chili Garlic Rice. I must say that the food is very delicious. Quantity is good. The price is reasonable. The food is worth the price and better compared to other restaurants in the city. The only problem is that space is very small and u have to order much in advance. During peak hours, you will have to wait a lot to get a seat. Overall great experience! Must visit."
"Recently been to this place Amazing China and had an awesome expereince of eating chinese food (Amazing special soup , lemon chicken and mangolian rice) and had an AMAZINGGGG expereince of good quality and superb taste ... After a long time had satisfied taste buds .So i give it a thumbs up.Must give it a try if you are craving for chinese ."

"Though there are lots of choices available for Chinese food in Mumbai , if you want to eat Chinese food that Treat Your Taste Buds to a Joy Ride ,Amazing China is the place to go . The staff was very polite and were quick in their service.. Food is awesome.....we had Chicken Safta , Chicken Crispy and Mongolia Rice was just superb . And as we were leaving the Owner "" Raphael"" just asked us to ensure that food and everything was good which was really sweet of him.....Its worth going as its was not very heavy on your pockets tooo."
"Right opposite Kamala Mills, this place is the only Chinese food option around.
So another Chinese joint to review. This one just satisfies the hunger but leaves your taste buds unsatisfied.
Its one of those places that you're not quite sure whether you want to visit again or not.
Tried the chicken crispy along with Mongolian and Continental Rice. I found both the dishes OK, like nothing great.
The food comes long time after ordering but in good portions.
The place is extremely small and can hold max 12 people at a time.
Sorry!!! But no more than 2.5 stars for this one."
"The food at Amazing China lives up to its namesake, ie. it is Amazing!

I heard about this place from quite a few friends and decided to check it out to see what the hype was all about.

The place is quite cosy with a very homely feel to it. I visited it with 3 other friends. The staff is courteous and very helpful. The owner, Raphael, is very friendly and also helps you to choose from the ample menu.

The food was quick to arrive and delicious to say the least. My favourites being the Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles, Lemon Chicken and their signature dish, Chicken Safta. The chicken pieces are juicy and very fresh. The Chicken Satay tastes quite like peanut butter (Reese's anyone?) and the...read more"

"Visited this place when it was newly opened few months back and every time it offered me new taste to crave for. I have tried Lemon Coriander Soup and Broccoli Almond soup - Both gets my thumbs up!! Worth trying.  Hongkong fried rice is also something you should not miss.
      Although small place with limited sitting arrangement, this place has delicious food to offer. Quality and Quantity of the food is just right and hope they maintain it in future. Service is very courteous and seems like customer feedback is valuable to them. Definitely will be visiting this place again...
