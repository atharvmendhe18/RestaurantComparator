"Very nice restaurant. Tried Mysore masala dosa, paneer Tikka masala and daal fry. All items were tasty and good presentation skills. Not to forget, butter naan. Good hotel for family or friends. Hope to see same quality when I will visit anytime in future."
"The service here is really nice. Try the Pav Bhaji, Mysore Masala Dosa, Manchurian Dry, Mixed Pakods and Sweet Lime Soda. A typical hygienic Indian Family Restaurant."
"Restaurant is good and hospitality also. Taste food is okay, as per price it should be great, but they have to improvise. Otherwise it‚Äôs good."

"Visited this place for a quick lunch last week. So just ordered roti sabzi. We ordered Butter roti, Veg Kolhapuri sabzi and Fresh Lime Soda. Really loved the their butter roti, it was soft and well cooked. Sabzi quantity was good. 

As we visited at lunch time, it was crowded but service was quick. Ambience wise its basic. It had AC and non AC seating.

One of the best place to have food near station."

.
The choles were melting in mouth and puri was fried perfectly (no oily at all)"
"This place is close to the Thane station on the West Side. You will also find many other outlets of food in the nearby areas. McDonald's is opposite to this restaurant. They have got a good ambience and option if A.C. and Non-A.C. are available. They have variety of things to offer you. A pure veg restaurant offering a lot many things. Starters, Chinese, Main Course, Dessert, Falooda, Snacks, Fast food, Thali, Puri Bhaaji, etc. Tried out Neer dosa and it was good. This dosa is very light. If you want eat something light, you can definitely try out this dish. This place is quite hygienic and offers quality food at an affordable price. If it was useful, kindly like/comment"

"We were here for a quick lunch. And ordered some medu vada, Rava dosa and then some tea.

Good for some quick bite near the Thane railway station."
"This place is located at a distance of 5 mins from thane station & is just opposite yo the McDonalds
Spacious place with seating arrangements upstairs as he Ac section

MISSAL PAV
Wasn't upto the mark I would say but for the money I paid it kind of worked for me.

CHEESE DOSA
This was one of best I had here,the chutney & the sambhar complimented the dish perfectly with their taste.

Price-90
Vfm-4/5

KAJU CURRY
Good with the quantity,good with the taste & very well presented
Worked for me.

Price-180
Vfm-3.5/5"
"We ordered Paneer Achari was unavailable, then ordered kulfi falooda, which was frozen, the sabja put in the falooda was totally frozen, that means it was made before hand and kept it in freezer. The overall experience was ok ok. But the falooda could be lot better.

Ambiance - 3.5

Food - 3.5

"The food was good i had ordered pav bhaji and a fresh lime soda.
Pav bhaji - It was good with that added dollop of butter.Pav was also butter fried but it is overpriced.
Fresh lime soda - i had ordered in sweet it tasted good and also worthy for price with quantity.
One thing though i would like to mention while i was still having my food the presented the bill on table which is something as a customer nobody would like it.
Overall the taste and space was all good."
Best place to go with your family. You will get best quality of veg food here. Staff is very polite. Service is too quick. Good ambience. They have AC as well as no AC compartment.
"This placed is located near thane station which serves you the best quality of veg food üòçThe quality and quantity of food is good ! Good decor and seating arrangement is very comfortable! We had ordered veg thali, sada dosa and mosambi juice"
"Shubh Sagar!

After a lot of waits, I finally visited this restaurant.

A decent restaurant with both AC and Non- Ac seating available. It is quite spacious. The service is fast and the staff is good. The place is good for Family and Groups.

What I had -
Manchurian Dry (5/5)
Perfectly made balls of veggies, fried and tossed with a lot of Garlic, Ginger, some veggies and Chinese sauces. It tasted heavenly.
A must try‚úî

Pav Bhaji (4/5)
The Bhaji was very pure ie not a lot of spices and artificial food color were added. Though I felt that the bhaji was a bit dry. It was flavorful and not so spicy. The pav was also fresh and buttery.

A good place to have lunch/dinner with your close ones."
Me and my friend there just to have a beverage to drink I opted for the filtered coffee and my friend went for watermelon juice the coffee was just amazing I have no words to describe it and th watermelon juice was not that great but it was decent but I would visit that place just to have their coffee it was that amazing 5/5 for the coffee and 3/5 for juice .

"Extremely overrated veg restaurant.
Food quality is good.
Service is quick.
Ambience is good.
Limited menu options available, must increase the variety the offer.
I had a little bad experience in terms of food they served. I ordered dry Manchurian and in one of the Manchurian ball i found a long plastic thread which was actually a piece of utensil washing scrotch pad. They immediately replaced the dish being sorry for the mess-up, but i had already eaten half the dish. Though this is not the reason for low ratings, but yes they should take care and make sure no food is contaminated with foreign particle.
If you dont have any other choice and are short if time then go for this restaurant."
"Very tasty food..been here many times...d food is vry tasty n quantity is also good...v have ordered manchow soup,fried rice,hakka noodles,butter roti,dal fry,paneer vegetable etc..even south indian good is vry tasty..."
"Asked for American chop suey. It smelled of rotten veggies. Had to put up a fight to get it replaced. Eventually ordered a pav bhaji which was okay. They didn't charge for the American chop suey though, only pav bhaji.
Did not have a good experience at all."
"I am Prasad Sawant, i feel heartburn to express my views and feedback wherein, i was craving for food as i was hungry i ask my Mom and my wife to take me here as i was impress and fascinated by the outlook and ambience and place here where i made mistake i was skeptical to order as to what to order it was my first visit to this restaurant. It was no displayed the speciality of the restaurant but i ordered Pav Bhaji and guess what it was the worst dish ever made the Bhaji was stale. Pav too was not heated everything was prepared previously it was worst expereince when stewards and Supervisor displayed no empathy no descency to display and they wanted us to adjust and consume is where i was...read more"
"It was Saturday morning was looking for vegetarian restaurant for breakfast . I decided to visit this place.
The restaurant looks very neat and clean
Seating is really comfortable .
Decor is quite good .
I ordered mysore masala dosa and buttermilk .
I wasn't expecting the way they have served the dosa i mean the presentation was very unique.
Sambhar and coconut chutney was really tasty.
Even the buttermilk was so flavourfull .
Service was so quick."
"Place was crowded to the core. The service was nice. Tomato soup was good.
Paneer tikka could have been better. The Paneer was a bit cold. Veg Manchurian was good."
"It's very close to thane station ,3min walk able distance opposite to McDonald's. Restaurant is segregated in two sections Ac and non AC. Food served here is quick and efficient. I have tried navratan korma, Naan and sweet lassi . Ambience and interior is nice . must appreciate the quality of food."
"Today, we have visited Shub sagar restuarent which is near to Thane west station. It's veg family restaurant and have two options
AC and Non AC. Have ordered Lasuni paneer Tika and triple shezwan rice. Food was ok but there was too much capsicum pieces in gravy. Ambience is also good."
"Pav Bhaji is the only item on the menu that one should try. Everything else is below average. I tried mysore masala dosa, paneer tikka, uttappam, pahadi grill sandwhich (this one contains raw ginger grated - 0.5/5 for taste), manchurian, medu vada, and idly before concluding this. Unfortunately, they were all huge let downs! :("
"Good place. AC seating is more comfortable. Be prepared for the waiting time. You might to wait for 30 mins or so on Saturdays or Sundays.

Recommend paneer chilli dry and pav bhaji.
Definitely a must visit place."
"The company has grown steadily to create a niche & benchmark of its own, thereby continuing to serve customers by the finest ingredients with delicate taste & outstanding services.

The continued & steady growth has created a stimulating atmosphere for serving excellent quality & fresh cooked meals.

The idea & motto of the restaurant was to simply create a cozy environment that was well suited to have great conversations & served quality freshly cooked meals. 

A very clean hygienic veg place to stop by and eat while traveling. From the food to the washroom everything clean. Full marks to team Shubh Sagar. Cheers guys

"Hello folks!!

This resto is located exactly opposite to McD and is tough competition to Shiv Sagar resto. It has been few months and they have all indian, south indian breakfast items and chinese cuisine.

Food: they serve all quick to prepare foods and obviously their customer segment consists of such people. We ordered paneer chilli dry, veg patiala, couple of naan n rotis and rice and dal tadka. They have typical standardised taste which you will sense at other shubh sagar outlets which is infact delicious and filling.

Ambience: They have AC facility above and normal seating below. They are quick in serving staple orders like pav bhaji, dosa n stuff. Their staff was cordial and...read more"

1. Sabudana wada 3/5.

Served with dahi, it was crispy and tasty but wasn't well cooked, within it was a bit raw still it was good to eat.

2. Veg Thali 5/5.

It consisted of 2 bhajis, 3 chapati's, daal, jeera rice, paapad, raita,
a small bowl of panner tikka and sevai as a dessert. It was a mouth watering and yum to eat everything up to the mark.

3. Veg Pekking Noodles 4/5.

"I was there with my friend. Atmosphere and staff behavior is good but the food quality is low. I ordered for cream palak soup which was as per my expectations but the paneer handi and Kashmiri nan was worthless. In kadai paneer, paneer pieces were very small and few and the dish's taste like veg kohlapuri. In kashmiri nan only a lot of fruit jam was spread out of nan. No stuffing of dry fruits was there. They need a lot to improve."
"New comer in the restaurant segment now there a big competition near thane station westbattling between shivsagar, Alok and now the third one shubh sagar ambience is great and lot of people enjoying the new restaurant good lights and well built restaurant just keep and eye for the physically disabled people as there are stairs to go up.

Food was not so great but neither could I complain about it. Our order was onion rawa dosa and szechwan spring dosa which could have been spicier.
"On a rushed Friday afternoon we decided to have our lunch at Shubh Sagar, Thane. It being so near thane station and probably the only AC restro we found. The AC menu rates are about ‚Çπ30-50 higher than most restaurants, however I decided to wait for my food to provide the final verdict.
