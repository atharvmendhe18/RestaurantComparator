the packaging is worst. I ordered from a good restaurant thinking the packaging would be good as I am outside and there is no cutlery available for me at the location. and I get the package in plastic bags
Food was not hot

the package was spilled
very poor quality

The food is below par for a South Indian restaurant. You can go for only Tea/Coffee. There are much better options in the vicinity as far as food is concerned.
