Review
"If the restaurant cares for the customer then they must refund the money, as everything was chucked in the bin. Our new year party was completely spoiled, a big turn off."

"they are charging 700 rs for what?? dont cheat the people.zomato need to review

and received half boiled rice"

"Received the package with salad dressing liquid spilled all over it. The delivery executive also had the spillage on their clothes. He also said he had complained to the restaurant about their poor packaging prior to order pickup and yet this happened.
It was my first time ordering from this restaurant and because of this issue, it'll be the last time.
The food quality and packaging doesn't match the price.
Disappointed."
"Must Try … Quality and Taste is really good, all the food ingredients were fresh… it will remain our favourite if the quality is maintained …."
No cutlery despite request

"Best Shawarma in Kharghar. I had always found Fatoush overrated due to undercooked meat. I have tried 8-9 places before finding this one. This joint checks all boxes - pickle, mayo, firmness of meat, fries, beetroot. Everything is authentic and perfect."
""
extremely bad food. the food is not even close to Arabic food . They put tomato ketchup in Falafel and Onions in Fatoush! please don't order from here

taste and packaging is excellent I was expecting a different bread like the ones they make and toast before packing the shawarma (like in gulf). the pita bread was ordinary.
definition of chicken that is cooked to perfection. very happy with the blend of sauces too. made our evening special.
"10/10... This restaurant is near to my place. Always love to try out new things on their menu, and never get disappointed. The rates are reasonable, and it's totally worth it. Kudos to the team!!"

"The salad description differed from what was delivered. Chicken was well cooked and grilled, but veggies included more of cucumber, peppers and capsicum and very less lettuce. Not worth the price definitely! Lot of lemon used, got a strange taste.
Overall an OK taste!"

"Too good a chicken shawarma!
Absolutely delightful."
"it. was totally warm and not followed the instructions
I m sorry I won't order anymore from here"
"Considering the most voted shawarma we settled on dajaj shawarma. The taste was really good and also they have not compromised on the packaging.

We have ordered from zomato so got two for 199. Got a great deal but still, Taste and fillings justify the actual price."
French fries are missing. Pls provide it. This is very disappointing
One of the best in the area in providing tasty and delicious food
tasty was nit good. chick was so dry. French fries was hardly... for Shawarma at Kharghar nothing comparable with Fatush

Ordered grill chicken but it was completely tasteless. Have tasted much better grill chicken in other restaurants
