Ordered the Paneer Kulcha and regular Kulcha from here. It comes with a side of chana which is incredibly authentic and tasty. Really reminded me of the kulchas I ate in Amristar at one of the dhabas. The kulchas are rich and one is more than enough for two people. Probably the best kulchas I've had in Mumbai. Totally recommended!
Please beware - they accept zomato pro only for bills more than Rs. 1000/-. The taste is also mumbaiya and not even close to Amritsar

"I have great experience everytime I visit this place, whenever the craving for Kulcha strikes, first place comes to mind is Pitambara
Their Amritsari kulcha is a must-try, It's so crispy and flavoured, with each bite you can feel flavour melting in your mouth, green chutney with onion is must with this-tangy and spicy..It's loaded with butter and they provide extra while serving..
So even if you are on diet, I suggest don't miss out on this, it's the best kulcha I had in Mumbai"
"Love amritsari kulcha, best kulcha I ever had till now in Mumbai highly recommend place ll surely vist"

Kulchas are a bit overpriced and stuffing is less in quantity. Too much whole coriander seeds in the filling. Taste is ok but not outstanding. Not value for money.
"I loved the Amritsari kulcha , Dal makhani and butter naan was also good , but being in Mumbai I was dyeing for punjabi food , till now I Have tried best in Mumbai"

Great service. Outstanding quality and taste of kulcha. Marvellous hospitality. Impeccable quality. Love how the kulchas are so crispy :)
"Just. Phenomenal.
Have been missing something like this in Mumbai - outstanding taste, great prices and oh-my-god the flavors!
Big fan of the paneer kulcha. Their dal and chole is to die for; easily beats all the fancy places where we pay in thousands and still don’t get that taste. Every bite brings back memories of home and childhood outings ❤️ Amazing work guys!"
"It's a newly open outlet and does a very good job in presenting authentic Amritsari Kulches. Strategically placed on Carter Road, this outlet is hard to miss.
Manisha took good care of our orders and was very warm and affable.

What we ordered-
Chaas - fresh and minty, just what was needed to complete the lunch.
Aloo Pyaaz Kulche - very well minced filling and served piping hot.
Muli da Kulche- the better one of the two, tasted very good.

The green chutney and chole accompanied the kulche very well, generous amount of better just topped the dish well.
