Chicken pieces were just bones and no flesh and all were just dumped in the gravy. Pathetic experience
I mentioned packing instructions and restaurant had agreed but still packed and mixed the both gravy orange and green together
it must be called vegetables keema instead of mutton keema. there was not much mutton in it
""
pieces were not cooked properly
""
burned food was served

"I didn't like the soup, thank god i ordered fried noodles with. Somehow managed to have it instead of wasting it.
Mutton biryani was not well marinated and was not fresh.
Not at all happy."
no taste

I would have rated in negative if there would have been an option...the owner of this shop is very rude charging 45 rs for 40 rs bottle of thumbs up and saying if you want to buy then buy or leave charges are very high too ..I would recommend Garva Biryani not at all promotional but there taste is good and price range is also good . And they are very polite too.
less masala and raita was too bad... only curd and onion

"quantity issue, wrong item delivered"
"Horror is the only word I have for the food.
the chicken was too salty the Garlic Naan was not butter Naan but Oil Naan and not cooked properly, the lolipop was stale and the soul was ok but the fried noodles were bad"

"No consistency of taste and quality
Getting worst day by day"
it was very spicy I have already requested for medium spicy but still they have send it very spicy
""
Chicken was not fresh. Found rotten smell and taste was horrific. Rice quantity was good but could have been better. Currently not recommending to anyone.

""
"it was great experience, Biryani test was delicious and quantity also was enough.."
Rice was raw very chewy and cold. Poor taste
Rice was having 80% masala and very less rice
""
""
super duper flop
"Masala was not at all there in biryani
I got on rice and pieces of chicken.
I ordered previously also but this time biryani was not good."
Test is not good and butter naan was not cook properly
""
Taste has changed the way it was years before. Quality has reduced seems after inflation has gone high.
very spicy
