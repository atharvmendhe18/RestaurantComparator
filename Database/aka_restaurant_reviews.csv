Review
Had a plan to see a play at Nehru Auditorium... So planned dinner at AKA.... We were three of us.. I my husband and my 10 years old daughter . The word when we started with our journey through this place was wow.... That it ended too with a bigger and wider wow... Special mention we wanted Jain food so the chef himself came and suggested a few dishes and voila.... They were super in each aspect... Be it look taste or smell.. We were even served complimentary dessert ..the smile on daughter's face while having it cannot be explained in words..... Already looking forward to our next visit...
"Best place to have a peaceful dinner with beloved ones. The ambience is very soothing. The service and management is very co-operative. Now let's talk about food.. It's got an out of the box menu and no doubt the taste makes me mad about this place. The menu here is not the same, they keep on changing and adding new items to it time to time. This makes one visit this place often."
"AKA is a easy to miss restaurant, as far as the newbies go it's really under the radar and quite easy to miss owing to its location which is a bit of a dead end. But when you get there you will find the place is designed well with refreshing burst of fresh colors and smart graphics. Check out their stylized logo! Very very smart!

Moving in to the food. Here the chef does a killer job and everything that came to the table was good to spectacular. We were a party of 4 and we started with a Turkish lancush?? Pizza which was thin crust with mouthwatering mince goat and feta cheese in the top. We followed it up with a crumbled fish platter and a chorizo based starter both again were...read more"
"Great ambience, quirky interiors, fun cocktails and an interesting menu. Perfect if you don't want a very loud evening. A great date place as well."
"Chandon Brunch anytime better than  5 star which they are serving these days. That's my personal take on what I had. From Champagne to Wines / Cocktails / Bar Spreads / Tailor made eggs / Pancakes / Appetizers / Entrees / soups / grills desserts - they have it all and FRESH.

At 2200/= it's a steal, fantastic ambiance, great vibe, fantastic service, good food, Lazy Sunday - Good sleep after that. Perfect.

Coming to what we had:

---------------------------------
Started with some Chandon Rose Champagne.
Was Impressed with the Bar Spread. Breads Made In House.

 A good choice of Cheese (Cheddar/Parmesan/Brie with Olives) Loved the Chicken Quinoa Salad (Kept it simple - Quinoa with...read more"
"Went to AKA restaurant at Worli for a Nearbuy discounted price fixed menu at Rs 1200 for a non-vegetarian four course dinner with one veg soup, one starter, two main course dishes, one dessert and two non alcoholic beverages for two persons. There was no option for soup which was only vegetarian in spite of the non veg selection. Minestrone soup was nice but only a quarter of the bowl for one person. Tasted good but would have preferred a non veg option since it was a non veg selection. The choice of starters was just two veg and two non veg so we selected the chicken wings with blue cheese. Nice preparation but the chicken wings were a bit small in size. The blue cheese was anything but...read more"
"Excellent Mediterranean cuisine. Definitely worth many a visit. Ate chicken and leek veloute, asparagus wrapped in Parma ham, snapper and baileys parfait. Full and happy!"
"This is a secluded restaurant in Worli. They have tried to make the ambiance classy, have chosen nice color scheme in decor but I wasn't particularly appeased by it.
Service was average and food wasn't great tasting either. We ordered brick grilled chicken and a half-and-half pizza (smoked duck and chicken). Brick grilled chicken looked good but didn't taste well.
Quite pricey for the experience it gives.

"I have always wanted to visit this restaurant.
finally the day arrived, entering the restaurant, the decor is very nice.

We had ordered the below:
1. Four Mushroom Soup: which was good but we had asked for extra truffle oil which they got it after the soup was over.
2. Minestrone soup: was good.
3. Sun-dried tomato, Ricotta & Spinach  Pizza: which was served cold.
4. Pasta with Pesto : which was decent enough nothing special. Have eaten better.

We couldn't reach till dessert as by the end of our main course we saw cockroach on our table which was the most horrible experience I have ever had. I really now doubt their hygiene level.

The service is horrible despite of no rush with hardly...read more"
"We think the A in AKA stands for Aztec. Everything in this place is in aztec fractals. From their geometric turquoise print chairs, their golden cuboid lanterns to their huge patterned walls, this place set a very professional mood. It however mellows you down with its soft music and dim lights. As foodies we always want to taste everything, buffets however, always get overwhelming and we end up stuffing ourselves before we reach the desserts. AKA had started a new price structure to address this issue. They had 16 dishes in Rs. 1200, and all in tasting portions. So you get to be in your MasterChef judge mode, eat your two bites of food and look for that hint of lemon."
"Loved the ambience! Was out for a casual lunch with office colleagues and decided to try this place out.. its a bit heavy on the pocket but the food is delicious in a very warm and comfy atmosphere. A huge place so you can be sure of it never being too crowded. We tried the goat cheese and assorted mushroom Sandwich(3.5/5) , the pan-fried fish (4.5/5 - muat try for fish lovers, though the clams werent quite palatable and had grit) and the chicken leg risotto (2.5/5 - a bit too bland, maybe because the other 2 dishes were way better, and the chicken was conspicuously missing. No leg there -just a few chunks). We wrapped up with a Baileys Parfait for dessert (4.5/5 - a yummmm dish, esp if...read more"
"While searching for new place for Sunday brunch, we stumbled upon this new outlet. The Chandon Sunday Brunch was a delight from the moment we stepped in. The stylishly laid spread with salads of different kinds, the large mirrors, the geometric patterned upholstery, the comfortable seatings and minimalistic decor added to its elegant vibe. With the first sip of the wine, we knew we were ready for an excellent treat. Hickory Pumpkin Soup was flavoursome (Note that i hate pumpkin, in any form!)
The eggs, sausages, breads and cheese and it went on. Though i loved the pancake, Barrel chicken and Seared Filet Mignon deserve special mention. Off the desserts, chocolate eclairs was my favourite....read more"
"Very much charmed by this placeüòç
Good vibes..
We visited d place for Sunday Chandon Brunch.. Wat follows is d culinary experience,

Hickory Flavoured Pumkin Soup, Toasted Almonds,
I have always had craving for good soup. I‚Äôve been trying all kinds of new soups, but this one really hit the spot..

Selection of Tapas & Salads,
Salads have always been my favourite course of d meal, you may be tired of the same old bowl of greens.
So do try these creative, balanced and satisfying mixes at AKA, they will fill you up with fiber and protein, healthy and tasty, fresh and rich wid nutrients - not just calories.
Loved d hummus and salads on d spread..

"I recently tried out the Sunday Brunch at AKA and it is pretty fancy. They have a Chandon brunch which gives you gives you starters, salads, entrees, dessert and unlimited cocktails.

I started with some chandon sparkling wine and it was pretty good. I also tried some red wine sangria which was really well done. Loads of apple in it and not over sweet either. I also tried their mojito which was really refreshing. The flavor of mint was amazing. And I also tried their lemon margherita which was good too.

Their salad variety is huge. There were variations of rocket leaves with different salad dressing. They also had a yummy watermelon and goat cheese salad which was my favorite. Anyone...read more"
"Ambience: Dazzling lights with elegant decor
The menu in itself is complete and gives the customers a vivid choice. Starting with, the 4 Mushroom Soup its amazing. The pizzas, ravioli, burgers all were an absolute hit! Tenderloin Steak and the Desserts is something that I would recommend as a must!
Great experience"
"I'd never heard of AKA and came across this through zomato while browsing for a brunch venue. Located opposite the nehru planetarium AKA is clearly a SoBo restaurant that serves classic continental cuisine. The large mirrors make the place look spacious while the bright, geometric patterned upholstery matches with the walls, giving the eatery an elegant vibe. It is brightly lit up and the varied colours in the d√©cor, make it feel fun and vibrant.
We tried the Chandon Sunday Brunch and it was quite a healthy treat. The tapas & salad spread as well as the cheese & charcuterie platter was superb and each one had its unique ingredients and flavours. The Hickory Flavoured Pumpkin Soup was...read more"
"A revamped, sexy fun place which offers diverse foods on its menu. All the vegetarian salads are fabulous especially the one with the goats cheese, figs and almonds. The quinoa salad was also fresh and simplicity at its best!
The vegetables with the flat bread sounds misleading but tastes great!
The grilled polenta and the pizzas were quite a disappointmet.
The chocolate mousse was the best part of the meal with not a speck left on a rather large helping of dessert.
Overall, a fun experience with trendy surroundings and interesting food!"
"I was hopping for the best when I came to AKA as I had read that dishes can be a hit or miss at the restaurant. I had booked a table through Wowtable, which I had hopped would give me a great taster of a wide range of dishes on their menu.

We started with an Amuse Bouche - which can only be described as unbelievably disappointing given its lack of seasoning.
Then we had soups - they were really great, especially the four mushroom. However this is where the dishes fell of the cliff.
The pizza was not a pizza. We ordered what was supposed to be a ""Margherita pizza"" and got a half baked, powdery cheese, no sauce pizza.
Followed was the main course. We ordered pasta aglio oglio, ravioli...read more"
This place will give you an absolute fine dining feel. We ordered for the four cheese pizza which was kinda disappointing because it had absolutely no toppings just plain cheese pizza. Also the red sauce pasta is a big no no because it was way too spicy. We also ordered for mushrooms which were delicious. Thanks to the mushrooms and the ambience i give them a 4/5
"A very classy and sophisticated experience;had ordered one buffalo sauce chicken pizza and grilled chicken,the loved the pizza.It was my first time experiencing Italian and Mediterranean food.Great ambience."
"Beautiful decor ..happy and lively with delicious food and great menu options ..
Chicken liver pate is a must try along with marinated prawns in anchovy butter üòãüòã"
"This is a much hyped joint.  The quality of food is good but portion sizes are very small and comparatively highly over-priced. 

Most guests tend to forget that places like these also add service CHARGE - 10% in this case (Services tax is additional). We were told that booking is a must but it was half empty at 9.00 pm on Sunday."
"Well a well deserved luxurious dinning!! Great staff!! Great food!! Being a veggie, they have less options as compared to non veggies! But the less options works quite well :)"
Fabulous molecular cocktail espl the whiskey based one. Pesto penne is great. Chorizo bread starter is awesome. And Panna cotta rocks. Must do.
"MIND-BLOWING! ABSOLUTELY SURPRISED AS TO HOW AWSOME THIS PLACE IS. THE ATMOSPHERE-CHECK,THE SERVICE-CHECK,THE FOOD-CHECK AND CHECK ! WE HAD THE STEAK. IM VERY HARD TO PLEASE IN STEAKS BUT THIS WAS WELL WORTH IT. BUT THATS NOT ALL. THE CARPACCIO WAS AUTHENTIC AND DELICIOUS. THE LEEL SOUP TOUCHED OUR SOULS AND LASTLY THAT DESSERT. WOW...JUST WOW. THE CHOCOLATE GANACHE WITH WHITE CHOCOLATE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN EVERY BITE! ONLY PROBLEM:A LITTLE HARD TO FIND AS GOOGLE DOESNT KNOW WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY. All IN ALL IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE. MUST GO!"
"AKA at Worli was on my list for quite some time. Today finally got a chance to to dine.

Location: Easy to locate since its opposite of Nehru Center.

Decor: Very trendy upholstery & furniture. Loved the ambience. Seating is very comfortable and big tables (for 2) gives you enough space to keep food, glass and your belongings such as cellphone etc.

Food: I had tried their 06 course meal. Don't get surprised with numbers of course, since they serve small portions hence you don't feel stuffed. It started with Amuse Bouche, soup, small plates, pizza, mains & dessert. Really enjoyed each course, as food was delicious.

an amazing experience..good food with quality...the turquoise blue decor my favourite...had the minestrone soup perfect to the taste...brick grilled chicken was just rightly tender with grilled baby potatoes..pizzas n many more...on the whole good experience worth visiting
"After multiple failed plans, we finally made our way to AKA Worli for a lazy Sunday brunch. There were four of us and my 10 year old nephew. The expectations were high after looking at their over hauled menu but they were significantly lowered when we walked into a near empty restaurant at 1 in the afternoon. This had never happened before but we decided to make the most of the unexpected calm that surrounded us.

The experience looked up at the very beginning with courteous staff and servers who knew how to do their jobs well! We were very excited about the molecular cocktails, so we ordered two of the Performer and one of the Panache. The presentation was on point for the Performer with...read more"
"I would like to compliment how well this place is located but I have many complaints even after such a high rating. The servers served me another dessert while I asked for the Blueberry Garden, which as lovely. The drinks were perfect to mention some the Sangria and the Demeanor. The assorted mushrooms as a starter were brilliant, what was really bad was the ravioli, we should have gone with the mushroom risotto instead. Even after the restaurant was so empty, there were problems with the seating arrangement and also the problems in food. If this gets solved this place has a good chance of doing well."
"We are overwhelmed to visit @akarestaurant two days backüòçüòç
Its an all day luxe destination with a curation of fashion and food embarking you on a culinary journey right in the heart of Mumbai.
Thes best part about this place is it's AMBIENCE , DRINKS and Also how can we forget DESSERTs üòÅüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
Must visit this place guys!! No doubt a excellent hospitality. Thanks for calling us and let us experience this lovely place ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Lovely place, nice ambience... Super cocktails. Specially the molecular ones. Yummy and delicious food. Had mushroom risotto which was super yummy. The deserts are great."
Great place to be but I feel slightly over priced cocktails could be the best now it is good.As far as food is concerned i found it pretty ordinary as compared to the ratecard. Unclusion of music near the bar could make the mood completely different than just having a drink. I feel a bar should be more than just having a drink..
"AKA - Don't over think or over analyse, it simply stands for Also Known As. The restaurant has been recently revamped with a fresh selection on its Menu that also covers Mediterranean courses from across the world such as France, Italy and even Egypt!

1. Ambience:
The d√©cor of the place is quite impressive and it is no wonder that the owners belong to the world of fashion! They already have 5 fashion houses in Mumbai, 1 in Pune but AKA is their first venture into food!! They have both indoor and outdoor seating option available and we preferred the indoors. The restaurant was well lit with classy d√©cor and rich interiors. The air conditioning was perfect and seating was very...read more"
"The decor is charming, it makes you wanna sip some wine and thats exactly what we started with- a bottle of Riesling! For starters we called for some Smoked Lamb Meatballs- succulent and yummm and Marinated Prawns- it somehow tasted like the butter garlic prawns we have at Gajalee (I'm not complaining). Wine makes me lose my appetite so straight away jumped to Pizza- Buffalo Pizza with some extra goat cheese on top- Beautiful and perfectly seasoned, reminded me of Naples! There's always some room for dessert, no!? Mille Feuille- the vanilla cream melts in your mouth, loved it! Service is good too! Overall damage- INR 4300 for 2 pax!"
"Deelicious food. Very good service. Very pleasant ambience. What more can one ask for a birthday celebrations with friends? The Four Cheese Pizza is a must, as are the desserts Chocolate Gianduja Mousse and Ecuadorian Chocolate Slab. The Mille Feuille though was not flaky, and pretty hard. That one you can skip. Of the mains, the Tenderloin Steak and Pork belly were very good, though the sauce of the pork belly needed to be less sweet, and have some more depth of flavour. All in all a very good meal.


Went again last night to AKA. Had another super experience. Manager Aniket and Chef Anil are to be particularly commended. Impeccable service. Great food. Thank you AKA"
Ambience of this place is really good.the overall look is pretty sofisticated.we ordered the minestrone soup which was good.the pizzas were superb with thin crust..the tortellini was a speciality..the chocolate slab in desserts was v nicely presented and it is must try.service was quick..overall a good quiet place to dine with family and friends.
"I write this review after being offered 2 incorrect dishes and in anticipation of my order. Pathetic service. It can only improve from here (hoping).


Update: the food served after the wait was cold and had to be sent back (there was no apology for this, but a discussion between the servers) - with no hope left we called for the bill and left!! #DISAPPOINTMENT #nevergoingback #youhavebeenwarned"
"‚ÄúFood is one part of the experience. And it has to be somewhere between 50 to 60 percent of the dining experience. But the rest counts as well: The mood, the atmosphere, the music, the feeling, the design, the harmony between what you have on the plate and what surrounds the plate.‚Äù ‚Äì Alain Ducasse

"Lousy attitude..
Started off well with good food but had run out of dessert of our choice. Manager says we can give you one scoop of vanilla icecream for our anniversary celebrations. Are they running an A grade restaurant or a fast food south indian joint??.
Manager argues with us.
On asking him to deduct the service charge from bill, he says that it is govt. Taxes. I corrected that service tax is and not service charge.
Finally relented and deducted service charge from the bill.
Must say a very miserly appproach to the customer."
"Good selection and choice
Salmon sandwich juicy and fresh worth a return visit decor moderate. Costs on higher side for portions. Service excellent"
"Located right across Nehru Planetorium is this gorgeous restaurant . And we'll admit, it makes quite a show. Snazzy interiors done in the shades of blue and orange with a spacious and comfy seating lend it a welcoming vibe. We loved the way they've done their name plate - Black and gold. Talk about elegance .
We started off with the Marinated prawns. The anchovy butter basting tasted spectacular. However, the prawns was undercooked which is why sadly the anchovy butter couldn't get the credit it was due for .
The buffalo chicken pizza though was amazing. Thin crush pizza topped with a great tangy sauce and shreds of chicken. The beautiful sauce is exactly what elevated the flavours to a...read more"
Overpriced and no value for money. Ordered the gardenia pizza which is steep at 650. Was expecting a lush inviting pizza with fresh vegetables and a Generous helping of feta. The feta was so sparse it might as well be off the description on the menu. Sad because the flavors and the sauce were delicious

Located in a quiet bylane of Worli‚Äôs bustling business district, AKA is conspicuous by its muted exterior that exudes understated elegance, right from its granite nameplate to the classy lanterns emitting a soft, yellow glow, the aesthetically manicured flower pots all over the entrance wall and the teak wood-panelled al fresco dining area.

This restaurant has a nice vibe to it .... the service here can't get any better ....they didnt allow us to have any complaints at all ... Spanish coca is amazing here ... the only thing that bothers me is the expense you have to deal with the meal :p
"AKA is quite an ambitious and modern restaurant owned by three people with names starting from the letters AKA, thus the name. Somehow I get the premonition that it struggles solely due to its location, but watching it run successfully in person really restored my faith in it, and I'm glad to say, the food helped its case too.

Service: At times slow and hence potentially annoying but they got the job done. They were well oriented and directed, hence quite pleasing. Nice to see staff members walk up to the car with umbrellas during the thunderstorm. But don't take anything away from them, they were very friendly and accommodating but certainly not flawless.

We were 4 of us. 2 of us had the quinoa veg burger which was not very bad. It lacked some seasoning and could I've had a better sauce to go with it.
The sides could have been better. We had the coleslaw which was just not very nice. The fries very extremely oily and the potato mash wasn't that great. But the Potato wedges were really good. They had an amazing crunch to them.

"We recently went to AKA and tried their new menu. It is an all-day casual dining experience located in Worli near Nehru Planetarium. It has an outdoor dining area as well. Inside there‚Äôs a long bar, bright interiors and colorful printed sofas. Also, you will find printed fabrics on the walls, which gave the restaurant a very vibrant but chic and elegant look.

AKA‚Äôs menu has a set of dishes where each dish is a version of European classic, Italian, Mediterranean and so on.

Since we went there for lunch we sat in their indoor cozy sitting area with dim lights and a chill environment.

"Excellent restaurant, Varun - the manager has an excellent approach and his way of communication with the knowledge and experience he has is outstanding. The home-made ravioli was a delite, so tasty we ended up calling for two portions. The chef took our request and customized our main dish as per our requirements. In all a great experience, would love to visit again soon."
"Had a nice experience on May 25 (Wednesday) while dining at AKA. I had gone there as part of a wine tasting group. The starters served with the wines were very good and everyone had a good time. Subsequently, since my wife and I were still feeling peckish, we sat down and ordered a couple of main course dishes and dessert. The main courses were nice, particularly the risotto. The dessert, some kind of Bailey's Irish cream concoction, was awesome. 

The restaurant has yet to catch the fancy of a lot of people. But surely worth going to."
"Absolutely loving the new AKA menu! I recently went there with a friend of mine and we both loved everything we ordered. We had the goat cheese salad which was a great, refreshing appetizer. For mains, I had the grilled chicken. The char on the chicken was PERFECT and added to the flavour of the dish. My friend had the lamb which was amazing too. The seasonal desert of mango panna cotta was the highlight of the meal and the perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. The restaurant has a vibrant ambience which is an added bonus."

The cocktails are well made as well.

"Although I was celebrating a friend's birthday, we did not tell AKA that it was her special day. The pizza was great, but the pesto pasta so-so. The tiramisu was an interesting take on the actual dessert. After paying, we filled up the comment sheet, and mentioned the date of my friend's birthday. Between the time that the comment sheet was read and our exit, the manager/owner stopped to ask whose birthday it was! And the icing on the cake was a surprise ""back present"" for each of the two of us - a fabulous touch, especially considering they had not known in advance about my friend's birthday. I would definitely go again."

"Great ambiance, spot on service, excellent plating of all dishes, but the food is not the hero of the experience. The taste is under-delivered."
A nice place for a brunch but was dissapointed with the main course they made us wait for 45 mins till the main course arrived and it just did not looking appealing rhe veggies looked dead as did the chicken they told us the chicken is marinated 3 days and it tastes really good but when it arrived no flavour at all chicken looked so pale.. I liked the starters and the dessert not sure if I will go back a 50/50 chance..

CHICKEN WINGS - yummy , clients loved it...
Vegetable Taginie: I would 100% take 2nd chance
great deserts, specially tiramisu.

I would give 9 out of 10 as there is always scope of improvement.. LOL

Looks like an Europian mix with lovely decor."
Food was extremely average. None of the mains ordered had any flavour and taste. Needs a lot of improvement. Service on the other hand was excellent. Hope the food gets better!
"I used to love 212 so it would take a lot for me to like a place that's come instead of 212 but AKA does impress.

We went there on Friday for dinner, actually stumbled upon it on our way someplace else. The decor is nice and looks middle eastern which was their earlier menu, the new menu is European. We had a sneak peek at the new menu layout. It looks good. Very premium just like the place.

The staff greeted us and Varun was our manager for the evening, very nice and a helpful host.

Food - great flavours. We had the smoked lamb meatballs and Turkish lahmacun pizza to start with. Both very nicely flavoured and made to perfection. For the mains we had almond & coriander crusted fish....read more"
"We were there last night, this is the new avatar of 212. The decor has been changed a bit but the overall look and feel remain the same. Coming to food, it was a big letdown. Right from garlic bread to the mains, we were left wondering about the drop in food quality. Infact we had to return pasta which was half cooked and to our shock the second time over as well it was equally bad... It was no surpise that on a sarurday evening peak time of 10 pm this place was hadly occupied. We had to wind up early, still hungry and head for our favourite starbucks."
"The place is right opposite to Jewel of India restaurant which is at Nehru science centre. We started with the assorted sea food platter which had calamari and prawns which was appetising. Then for mains, we had the pan seared fish, which was well done but the gravy was slightly different to the taste buds which was interesting. I would have preferred the chicken option to the fish here but it was unavailable. The chef gave us a complimentary blueberry cheesecake much to our delight and it was very palatable. Overall, ambience is nice, the staff is very warm and amicable, food is good. I think the variety in chicken dishes is one thing which can be improved in the menu, rest is great"
"Introduction: Sometimes good food happens when you least expect it. We visited this restaurant on 18.04.2016 as a group of about 14 friends for a birthday celebration. I had never heard of this place before and were really keen on trying out something out of the regular. I came out mildly surprised and happy with the whole experience.

D√©cor & Ambience: The first impression you get when you get off the car is chic. They have outdoor patio sitting and an air conditioned section inside. The place is huge with well spaced out tables. The lighting is bright and so is the chairs. I like the chairs!!! The place had feel good factor to it. It is a nice place to spend a lovely evening here in...read more"
"Aka is where the erstwhile 212 was and the menus are fairly similar. Went there today for the Wow Tables set menu experience
We had soups and salads for starters .. Of which the mushroom Capuchino soup needs a special mention.. This was followed by appetisers .. Sliders and prawn peri peri .. The lamb slider was very nice .. Post which we had pizzas .. Pepperoni and Barbeque chicken .. Think crust and nice
followed by the main course.. Had a chicken breast.. Pork burger.. Lamb burger and a pasta
Desserts were panacotas and ice creams
Overall very filling .. But too many bread based dishes .. They mentioned that the menu would be changing in May 2016.. This would give it its own identity...read more"
"Nice place to be. No reservation needed.
Try the mushroom baklava, and truffle fries. Must have dishes! Also try the chicken skewers. Last time couldn't try much as there is no Jain variety there."
"A special dinner with your close friends means a lot to everyone in this time and age where everyone is so busy that catching up gets difficult. The reason I mentioned this was that such special occasions don't only require good food, but also a restaurant which has a good staff and an ambience which eases one out after a long day. Last night my friends and I dined at AKA as it was one of our close friends birthday. We had a culinary satisfying experience. Some of the dishes that left a mark were;
1. Lebanese platter
2. Proven√ßal Verdue (Pizza)
3.Angel Hair Aglio Olio pasta ( highly recommended)
4.Linguine, Pomodoro Sauce and fresh basil leaf
5. The spinach Raviloli
6. panacotta...read more"
Awesome food and drinks!! Perfect place to get out for a quick bite and drink with friends or family.. Service is exceptionally good and so are the preparations!!
"A perfect to visit with your special ones. If you are in doubt to take your date out for dine... then this is the place. A perfect SOBO place.

Why visit :
1. Plush ambience, warm service (little slow though). Good music
2. Italian cuisine is its strength. Otherwise menu is safe. Nothing exceptional or experimental but decent.
3. Portion size for appetisers can be better"
"I had casually booked a table for 2 at the Wow tables offer for last friday. My husband and i were not sure if we really wanted to go as we had never heard of anyone who had been there. But we decided we should go. It was a fantastic experience and value for money. We had a 5 course meal for 2600/- including taxes.
The place was very well lite with a nice bar hustling with people. The Cappuccino of wild mushroom soup was absolutely superb. The chargrilled Prawns with avocado tapenade roasted hebanero chilly and cocktail sauce was fantastic. The Pepperoni pizza was the best I have had and was full of pepperoni. The garlic and chilly rubbed chicken was so flavourful and well made. Last but...read more"
"Heard alot of mixed reviews (more negative than positive) but decided to wing it and check it out.
Reached around 830 pm, was really empty ( 3 tables were full but it's such a large space it feels awkward on a Saturday night). Really nice decor and outside seating as well.
So with the food, started with a mushroom soup and a leafy salad which were both nice.
Them ordered two starters, a baked cheese and the mezze platter. The cheese is an acquired taste, but it wasn't ours. Especially with soggy slices of bread. The mezze platter was nice, but I love my mezze and I would out this in the bottom 3. The pita bread was just bad, and crispy! The falafels were average.
These were so so...read more"
"There is so much to talk about this place. I went here on a weekday afternoon with my family. This place is pretty secluded and not many know about it. Well this place is a gem. We booked our table through wowtables.com, which provides 5 course meal in 1200. The ambience here is very good and bright, with really good music. The service here is very good and also friendly. Food is the main part and it scored very well. We started with cappuccino of wild mushrooms followed by balsamic marinated rocket leaves salad. The soup was great in taste, different and in prefect quantity as I expected. We ordered Lebanese sampler and pizzas with it. This was also different and authentic. The most...read more"
Excellent food and service.the breads are fresh and the pizzas soups and pastas are to die for.superb ice cream caramel.great location too.greatly recommended
"Visited this place last night for a wine event with All Things Nice. Didn't know about this restaurant before as it is a bit hidden (if you are not from that area, you probably wouldn't know like me) but wow.

First of all, even before entering the restaurant, the bright and modern color and pattern of their chairs greet you. On the left is a small colorful clothing label that invites you to look through some of the dresses before you enter AKA.

As we were there for the wine event, we didn't get a chance to taste the sit down menu (but we will come back soon!). Enjoyed Reveilo wines and super delicious starters/finger food. My favorite was the sausage with colorful peppers. Yummy!
