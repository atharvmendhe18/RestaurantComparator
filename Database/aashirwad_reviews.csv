Review
"The food was strictly average.
Nothing exceptional.
The service could have been a bit better.
Dosa and idli items can be had due to lack of good eating options"
"The place is pretty decent and gives good value for money. It's located right next to the IC church and hence is very easy to find.
Been to this place a couple of times. The Chinese and Biryani over here is really good. Especially the Chicken Tikka biryani, it has the right amount of spices and tastes really good.
The staff here is polite and friendly."
Amazing tandoori and punjabi and south indian food . It ia also reasonable as compared to other outlets and the quality of food is always freah.
"Good service, the place is spacious, and food is amazing over here. You can have good breakfast over here, then they serve good mughlai dishes as well as Chinese food. They even have a small counter outside the hotel where you can get amazing eateries and dessert. The price is good and the quality is also nice."
"This place is always crowded with people. Been to this place a couple of times. I like the chicken biriyani here. The chicken is cooked properly and also the spices blend perfectly with the chicken. The staff here is friendly and the service is also good. If you are a student of St Francis institute of Technology, there‚Äôs a special 15% discount for you. Its a good value for money. I strongly recommend the Chicken Biriyani here."
"This place is just outside the church and is open from dawn till dusk. The staff is very friendly song with the management, this place is always filled with people. Their Chinese, Indian, south Indian, breakfast, snack n tea is something you must try, they serve amazing sambar with idli wada. Their kheema pav is also good, all in all this place servers everything under one roof. They even cater for small n large gatherings. A big thumbs up."
Its an Okay Place to dine with Family and groups. Though the space to have a meal is quiet small because of the benches but overall its a good place to sit n have a chit chat. The Breakfast dishes served here is worth a try specially the Masala Dosa. Starters like Chicken Lollipops are good with the Masala. Butter Chicken is all time Favourite over here. Overall for Familes it is recomended.
"Food was okay. The staff was very good. The waiter was very polite and kind and took care of everything. A++ to him. Place is cheap, interiors are average, nothing to brag about, but nothing to rant about either. Overall I don't mind going back."
"The beat place to visit in ic colony. Very very budget friendly... can fit into anyones budget.
Everything on the menu is available and the menu is vast. With diff types of cuisines.
Staff is extremely polite and quick."
The food is very good and tasty ....though not a very good ambience but good seating arrangements and the price is also very cheap ....non veg food is fresh and chicken is very tender and Juicy ....staff is also good .....the restaurant is right opposite to IC church and easy to locate ...overall it was good
"This is among our most fav. Food is tasty. Frequently when we cannot decide where to order food from, we end up ordering from here. A small decent place with friendly and prompt staff."
A Hotel in IC Colony which i prefer going for my breakfastüòç. It has super tasty food and a good seating arrangement. I usually eat omlette and masala dosa there in my breakfast. At Evening time you can get shawarma which also lasts late night sometimesü§ó.
A very famous and well known place. Within the budget. College hangout lunch session. Decent food. Good quantity. Quick service. Loved by all.
"Nostalgia overloaded !! It's a quaint calm place on the junction of LIC and IC Colony. Basic furniture and subtle ambience, this place is proud to be modest. It's starts very early in the morning around 7 Amish, the morning specials being Upma, Sheera, Uthapas, Dosa, Bhurjee, Puri Sabzee. The food is awesome and nicely palatable. As they progress in the day, the chicken and mutton dishes take prominence over the other sides and vegetarian dishes. The Kheema Pav is the centrepiece of the culinary offering of this place. I have seen this place being around for over 20 years and I am glad to know that NOTHING has changed. This place holds a intangible value in my heart since this was our...read more"
"Been eating from here from a very long time. Trusted place for food. Never ever had disappointed whenever I've orders from here.
Home delivery is quick as always and their must tey is sunday morning kheema pao and misal pao. Chinese is also a must try."
Taste of chicken is well served but chapattis are bad . Don't like them. Tandoori rotis are served hot. Curies are also tasty I like it. Aura is old n hot
This small restaurant in IC colony borivali is just a gem among many stones..serves some amazing food at quiet a reasonable price..I tried out the mini chicken pizza for Rs.35 which was fresh and jus amazing..so is their paneer roll...in their main course the butter chicken..chicken biryani is a must..do visit this place foodies..
"No fancy interiors No air conditioning but very tasty food. Aashirwad is simple awesome. The first time I went there I didn't expect the food to turn out so good. This came as a suprise so did the quick service. I would recommend veg biryani, pahadi kebab, sheek kebab and chicken Afgani."
"Well, i studied in the st. francsis school which is basically very much near to this restaurant. So i specially had a personal touch with this restaurant. Had eaten over here most of the time after school. What i really loved was the kheema Paav at this place. Not Much have you ever heard or tried this over there, but i always love exploring and this is what i found while exploring over there,The Kheema Paav.

Wasn't expecting the biryani to be good. It was just a random thought and ordered one. But turned out to be awesome. The chinese was equally good. Place is neat and average. And price is very pocket friendly.
"Aashirwad is best restaurant to visit in IC Colony area, I am blessed to have office in that area. From break fast to dinner you get everything here with pocket friendly n good quality. Ashirwad Special Non-veg rice, paya soup, chicken tikka masala , khedkar pav are few dishes one should try"
"Well, I studied for 16years in St. Francis next to this place and never visited it. Visited it yesterday.

I was recommended Aashirvad for it's Paaya Soup and Im glad I visited. Their paaya soup was one of the best I've ever had. I immediately pledged to visit this place even if just for their Paaya soup every weekend.

We also had Steamed rice, Dal fry which was just outta the world and some chicken curry I dont remember the name of but was recommended by the guy who served us. He was one gem of a person. Kept asking us about the food after every meal. I was disappointed by their Sweet Lime Soda as they prepare it using Sugar instead of Syrup.

This place aint that fancy but will suit...read more"
Excellent restaurant in terms of cost and quality. Chicken biryani and tandoor chicken is the best. The chinese food is very economical and tasty.  The staff is very courteous and they do have home delivery.
I just love the leg biryani give with the raita which is the best biryani I have ever had ..apart from the leg biryani one can also have the paya soup and other chicken biryani .also south Indian dishes are being served here ..overall pocket friendly place .
"Having the advantage of prime location with no other decent restaurants nearby with the' Aashirwad ' of local guests, the restaurant is flourishing, but it is lacking the basic hospitality. The ambiance is not enough and congested. I had snacks in the morning with my family and evening I was alone. I had a bitter experience of having rested tooth belt in the masala dosa which I noticed at the end by the hard bite by which my tooth might had been broken, or if swallowed it might had been worse . I called the waiter and told him to call the manager. .Instead of having the basic hospitality I got the reply from the waiter that it may happen sometimes .I was bit embarrassed to note that no...read more"
"Aashirwaad is that humble restaurant near your house on which you can bank on to satiate your hunger as well as taste buds when you are low on cash or when parents are not at home!
Having studied for 4 years in an institute nearby, this place has truly been an 'aashirwaad' for us!
From the chicken kheema at breakfast to the chicken kadai at lunch,from the humble biryani to the Chinese for dinner, this place has served up patrons with much satisfaction for long...

Total VFM place!"
"I have tasted ""Chicken Wing"" of this place and it was really mouth watering. They have filled kheema inside the wing served with schezwan sauce, ohhhh it was delicious."
Right opposite I.C Church this restro has been the hub of everything right from morning breakfast to evening snacks. The food quality is decent and the service fast as well. You may also care to taste the paani puri center right next to it. Great place too.
Visited the place for breakfast today. Had ordered the chicken tandoori a few weeks ago from here and so had high expectations from their South Indian. Decided to have medu vada. Was very disappointing. The medu vada was cold and not tasty. A disappointing start to the morning. We were the only people yet service was poor and there are no juices available which is sad.
"Located bang opposite IC church, Aashirwad has been around for ages. Under new management, their food quality has gone a notch higher but still hovers around the above average mark. Apart from the usual south Indian dishes, a favourite is their Mutton Sukka."
Bang opposite to the church...its a quite decent resturant which offers a regular menu..its pocket friendly...ambience is normal...biryani and chinese dishes are average but good quantity...its usually full by the young school people and people who come to play football..so be lucky enough to find a place to sit
"Aashirwad has been the heart of IC colony since a long time now,well known to serve soul food that you would relish joyfully. Always busy with home delivery orders but they dont forget to serve all the customers in their restaurants at the same time.some of the amazing dishes that you can try are:
*chicken tikka biryani
*manchurian rice
*kheema pav
*paya soup
*butter chicken
these dishes will definitely make your day. the best part is that Students of St Francis can avail a discount of 10% everytime you have a meal there :)"
I really like this place. They have many varieties. Sukha chicken is really nice. If u r in ic colony and looking good food in less budget then this is the best place to visit.
"Aashirwad has been in borivili since long and is one of the good places to have breakfast. They serve good missal pav, keema pav and south indian food. Chinese is also pretty decent here. The service is quick, but the place is not all that hygienic. Good place for a quick meal if your visiting borivili."
Visited this place for a snack this evening. Ordered the misal pav and sada dosa. The misal had more farsan than actual misal and it tasted just ok. The pav was served cold. The sada dosa was alright.
"Well, the only thing you can say after eating at this place is ""not bad"". Food is not awesome, but not bad as well (prices are also not heavy on pocket). Had chicken masala which was alright. Chicken crispy was very nice. Heard a lot about kheema pav served at Aashirwad, yet to try that one. Service was good."
A very nyc fast food corner right in the heart of IC Colony situated just nxt to the church. Its a very convenient food joint and very pocket friendly as well.
"Good staff, good food, very prompt with home delivery as well. Very good place to sit and have some good food.
Breakfast is the best, nice and fresh... Accompanied with a cup of tea. Full marks to Aashirwad."
"Decent and value for money food quality and quantity. Simple and decent restaurant where you won't find lukhas and irritating crowd. Good service few items are local favorites like Kheema Paav, Egg rice, Bhurji  

Being opp I.C. Church visited mostly by church crowd and families.

Cons lacks good seating place and air conditioning."
"A good place for hanging out with your friends. The food here is just about decent. The ambiance, staff, seating needs to improve.
Very easy on your wallet though."
Not at all impressed. It's like a road side outlet serving you rudely for the price of an air conditioned place. Wouldn't go here again given the fact that there are many other alternatives available nearby
It's an amazing place for breakfast....just had the missal pav and kheema Pav... I believe the best Missal in Borivali is served in aashirwad... Do give it a try
"Just opp IC church. Famous for its snacks. The church crowd rushes to this place after the Sunday morning mass for Burgers, rolls, sandwiches, puffs etc. Average rates. Average place. Decent food."
Good joint...food is average...ambience is cleanbut moderate....indian punjabi food is good...chienese is poor....must try the paya soup and chicken leg biryani
This is one restaurant where you can get whatever and whenever you want. They do a decent job with respect to butter chicken n biryani which one may try.
known this place since was a kid.. Placed in a prime location... Medu vada and Dosa's are awesome. dont try anything in chinese not that great.
"Located in a prime locality, this is a place am sure would have been visited by most of the borivali folks. Its my fav place to have kheema pav. I don't think there is anything around that serves this in the morning. The taste is good and it has good service level. Besides kheema pav, I also love the paya soup which is quite tasty. The breakfast of dosa, upma and sheera is also pretty good. I love this place, it's something that I visit atleast 5 to 10 times a month."
"Very reasonaly priced but like everyone else would comment the ambience is nil, delivery is generally quite speedy if you ask and their soups are great I would say, athough the curries fairly bland"
Amazing Paya Soup and Kheema... Often you'll see people flooding the place after Sunday morning mass... Great place to stop by at any point of the day...
"I seriously don't understand why it has so high ratings. I mean it's IC colony, there are a whole lot of options than this restaurant. I ordered chicken manchow soup for appetizers and my nightmare began...it was sour, not spicy; but sour. It mean I literally had to puke after coming home because it caused me acidity. But I was hungry so decided to give one more try...and ordered chicken triple rice and it was OK. Definitely not worth the ratings it is given. I mean there are a lot of roadside chinese corners who will make this restaurant's triple rice to shame. I think it is one of the most overated restaurant in the area. I am definitely not going there again!!!"
Every ic colony local has at least once eaten here. Their medu wada and dosas are good. Chinese food is not that good and please avoid ordering it. This restaurant is just good for snacks.
I am staying in Borivali from past 4 years. I am never tired of its taste. Every alternate day I eat from here. Chicken Schezwan Fried rice is my favorite here.
"It is a very old restaurant in the catholic populated area of IC colony. The ambience is ok not anything grand, just wooden benches and tables. It is quite small in size as well. But the food especially the chinese rice and noodles, the different biryanis and the punjabi dishes like butter chicken are very good. Even the kheema which is der in breakfast menu is excellent but little expensive(Specify it to him that u want normal kheema fry and not kheema masala or kheema ghotala as they call it there). The overall menu is quite cheap but the food quality is excellent."
"This is one of the oldest restaurants in this locality. Over the years the management has gone through a lot of changes. Of recent, they serve good food in this place. You may want to try Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani. I like it because it comes with a lot of masala and it's moderately spicy. I have also tried the breakfast dishes but I have not found them to be much to my taste. I have tried better ones."
"Aashirwad is one of the oldest restaurant in ic. It is situated opposite ic church. I have been coming for many years and i feel i have tried all their dishes. The staff keep changing but not the menu.
Resently they started to upgrade the menu. Paya soup is not great but one can try. Kheema ghotala is a must try. They used to serve good Indian Chinese but one can have Chicken lollipop it's great.
The ambience is ok. The place is clean and overall they serve good food."
"Ambience isn't that good !! Just another common restaurant....The kheema pav here used to be great however it's quality has decreased !!
A Sunday seems to be the best day to visit this place for a meal"
"Not a great place in terms of ambiance nor its perceived hygiene but the only item that drove us to this place is its Paya Soup (came highly recommended by a colleague). I must say, that's a sheer delight especially during monsoons or when you are down with a cold. Have seen frequent visitors for its soups and Chinese. If you can look past the surroundings, its an OK place."
"If you enter this place during lunch hours, you will notice it will be crowded with students from near St Francis college. Don't expect much from the ambience, its more about eating and making place for others. Well known for its Chinese cuisine, I think this is a hot spot for most of these college students and people expecting a quick bite.

Quantity is good, and the price works fine, if you are going in a large group. The quality could get better, the flavors are decent and food is warm when it reaches the table. The service is pretty quick and the staff is also okay.

Simple food, pocket friendly and good place for college students. Food for 2 works any where between Rs. 200 to 400."
"Aashirwad almost feels like home.Maybe,cuz the place has a very Mangalorean feel to it.

Ok,now about the food..well they serve really delicious south Indian cuisine.Even the Chinese is super yummy!! But nothing beats the ""Aashirwad Special"". :)

Its priced well, both quality & quantity wise they meet upto your expectations.

(P.S They give special discounts to all St.Francis Institute students, make the most of it.)"
"If you are hungry and dont have anything to eat, just call up at this hotel. Small place, non ac seating. Looks like a proper chineese stall. Chicken Triple Schewan Noodles is just awesome. Varities in veg n non. veg chinese dishes. Yummy!"
"I have visited Aashirwad several times in the past few months. There is not much to write about the ambience because they don't even strive to create one, and that's fine. They are no frills - come eat pay and leave.

I have been very disappointed with their prices. One idli is 15 INR. Seriously? It costs THAT MUCH for one idli? I will pay 5 rupees but 15??? The same goes for their medu vadas as well. For a restaurant as shabby as this one, I'm shocked how much is charged. I have ordered their chinese food, but never was really impressed. Was not even impressed by their indian main courses. For snacks, they are fine.

Their staff is very prompt and helpful."
Nice place to order from. Very reasonable with good quantity. Pocket friendly
Cheap and average quality food
"Awesome food,friendly staff and use of rich and healthy ingredients. Have been a home like eatery since last 15 years."
"Awesome place to hangout with friends with high appetite.
Food is very reasonably priced and tasty.
Chicken lollypop, Chicken fried rice and Paneer Makhanwala deserve a special mention because they're simply fabulous.
They serve shitload of sides with every dish such as salads, fried noodles etc.
I used to be a regular here with friends during my college days, and we still revisit the place to revisit our awesome memories.
All staff is friendly and fast.
Good for family and friends.
Not so ideal for dates as the place is usually very crowded and noisy."
A small place but not small in delicacies..Chinese food is A must to have here and the beautiful part is that you get it anytime round the clock! Biryanis taste so yummy and the service is quick as well!
Awesome biryanis!!! Hats off!!!
"A regular joint for students from the St.Francis Institutions, next to which it is located, and IC colony locals Aashirwad is a perfect lazy afternoon restaurant. A meal for 2 would typically amount to Rs.300 or lesser. The ambiance is as simple as it gets but is comfortable and clean. Service is fast while the food itself is fine enough. The Mughlai cuisine is very good and the Chinese is the type you would get at any local mumbai chinese place. However if you're looking to fill you're stomach up while keeping a check on your pocket then the chinese cuisine here, quite literally so, fits the bill!"
The quantity is amazing..pretty reasonable rates...u get really good kheema there as well..
"Small place. Not a fine dining place by any ""Fine"" sense. Food is value for money and is fast and clean. Not much to speak of in terms of ambience. Get your regular veg and non veg fare. No differentiators from most other Udipis - in fact almost operated like one, Service is passable with a fist full of salt - a pinch will fall short."
