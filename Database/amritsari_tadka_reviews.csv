"Most dirty food and what u will order u won't receive it u will call for something u will receive something
I am High disappointed whit the service"
really bad tasting food. poor quality.
"Y'day I ordered home delivery, one plate each of Dal Makhni, Chicken Masala, Bindi Masala, Butter Paneer Masala and Alu was a punjabi restaurant, the food will be authentic. Never heard of thick gravy Alu Methi, gravy bindi Methi..... Except for the Dal Makhni, nothing was worth the taste. Thinking, that, it was a punjabi restaurant, the food will be authentic. Never heard of thick gravy Alu Methi, gravy bindi masala, all the gravy's were the same type, except for the red color of bhindi masala, and yellow gravy of alu methi. very dissapointed. The guests too, were not happy. nobody touched methi aloo. it's supposed to be a dry item. even bhindi masala is a dry item..... I ordered veg...read more"
"I ordered chicken schzwan fried rice for dinner, as i was to hungry n looking for some friendly pocket food. So i found this hotel near my house and i ordered.
The food was to oily, it was like rice floating in OIL.
I have uploaded the pic as well to show u all that how oily the food was. Literally i had to put tissue paper on my plate n eat..
God save us from this kind of oily serving food restaurants..."
"Small place, easy to locate, zero ambience. No comfortable seating. No proper ventilation. Good service. Pocket friendly restaurant with good food."
"I had a roasted ravas fish
It was quite expensive....
Even after proper instructions of no masala the fish fry was full of masala and even had a bad odour
Completely irresponsible attitude"
"Well, if it wasnt for the last order, i'd givn it 4/5. You see, i was completely smitten by their butter chickn. I can safely maintain it's one of the best i've ever had. So def recommnd tht. But i really judged them the last time. Calld for chickn tangdi kebab (grilld well but absolutely tasteless) and amritsari biryani (shouldnt hve falln for this). It was a farce! A tasteless joke on your palate. I thnk people of amritsar shud sue for using their city's name to sell tht rice & chickn masala mash. In their defence, i'd say the owner is polite, the delivery quick & prices modest. To try it or not, well, you are the judge."
"A decent place for Punjabi food. Slightly to the economical side given the locality. The food is good especially the non vegetarian dishes for the price. Doesn't have much of an ambience tough. A good place to order from.

Food 3.5/5
Service 3/5
Price 3/5
Ambience 2/5

Overall 3/5"
"Spawning out of the average Mumbaikar‚Äôs pronounced reluctance to navigate through the city‚Äôs grime and traffic to enjoy a decent meal, a slew of takeaway enterprises is taking the city by storm. As the law of averages goes, some of them dish out such amazing food at prices so affordable; you almost want to say a prayer for them. Others, on the contrary have you hurling out expletives as you reach for a bottle of laxative. 

Moving on from the rhetoric, let‚Äôs put this tiny takeaway - Amritsari Tadka into perspective and see if dining here is worth the while or we have yet another foregone conclusion in the ‚Äòme too‚Äô world of food delivery!

I have no idea in the world how...read more"
"With a lot of good takeaway and delivery chains opening up in and around Andheri, Amritsari Tadka enters the herd of good food but fails to stand out.

The impression set by the timely delivery is soon faded away by the flimsy packaging which has a chance to be improved upon.

A delicious aroma warps the space around as I open the aluminium box- there staring at me are juicy looking Chicken Lasooni tikkas. Without sparing a second, the evergreen appetiser is in my mouth and it is indeed cooked perfectly to all it's glory. The juiciness of it is the winner of tonight's food.
The other appetiser with it was almost as good- Chicken Achari Tikka. It was not as juicy but equally feasted...read more"
Got to love their Chicken tikka and chicken tikka biryani. Nothing better around. They've recently added the north indian speciality - Champ - Soya tikka is what i call it. Tastes great if you have vegetarian taste buds!
The chicken tikka and chicken malai is excellent. They have gone out of their way to prepare the food to our taste and liking. Will be eating from here often
"i m an total  foodie ..and i like to experiment new joints every week , i cam across this place at 7 bunglow and found they serve tasty butter chicken in Mumbai ..i just loved it
even dum biryani was made in authentic way ..preparation was good &  i was more concern about the service ..though they don't have many tables but it doesn't matter when food is good
owner or chef - please keep the same taste i will visit soon"
"This restaurant is so close to where I stay, I walked in this evening for a takeaway of 2 chapaties to accomodate an extra person coming over to dine. Now i totally understand no restaurant will deliver only 2 chapaties, but none will refuse to parcel a couple if u go in to collect yourself. They could if they are brimming with customers and dont wish to entertain small orders. But definitely none that are anyway as jobless as this place. The guy behind the counter gave me a many a look - first for my order and then because i did not have change.

With that sort of I-dont-care-about-a-customer attitude, this place wont go over its low rating until this guy is around. Or until they serve...read more"
If u really like to eat something authentic from punjab then u must experience this restaurant ...I mean. Crazy for butter chicken and I must say u will love it for sure and tandoori chicken it's yumm ...
"Amritsari Tadka is a excellent place to try Indian delicacies. Dishes like amritsari chicken , chicken patiyala, mutton curry are a must try . Hv been eating here since a few years and my experience has been wonderfull . The Chinese with the typical Indian touch is yummy aswell . The paneer dishes are very tender and which shows tht quality food products are used to keep up the reputation of this restaurant."
"One word which comes in my mind after eating their food, ""AWESOME"". Each and every thing since the time i placed my order was just perfect. As it is mentioned got a 10% discount on my order which was the first out of many positives. Received my order within 35 mins of placing it. I had ordered for a Chicken Bhunna, Chicken achaari tikka and Garlic naan. After eating all of this what i realized was that the taste was just too good!!! Starting from the tikka, which was very juicy, had an awesome flavor and had  a very good quantity. Second dish which i was looking forward to was the Chicken bhunna which had a very good thick gravy and also the pieces inside were very tender and tasty. For...read more"
"Have heard mixed reviews about this place and that's because of their inconsistencies in preparing the same food. Two weeks back an amazing daal turned into a garlic soup yesterday. They have some good paneer & chicken dishes but the quality of flour they use for roti and nans is not good. Try them as your last resort...and nd yes one special mention...order food of more than 300 rupees otherwise you will face the wrath of the delivery supervisor free with the half spilled, high on garlic food!!"
"Have been to this place and ordered as well a couple of times.... The food is simply awesome, I'm a fan of the butter chicken prepared by them. Though the interiors aren't that great, however the quality and quantity of the food compensates for the same.

"The food ordered was stale and smelling, the quality of the food was so bad, that the guest went home hungry. It was a big mistake to order food from here.

Lovely food...loved the fried rawas it was sooo yummm very crispy and something new.. would love to try the the prawns biryani and chicken t
"Amritsari Tadka is easy to locate and has been around for quite some time now. I had read some bad reviews about the place and was skeptical to try it out. Finally, went there and sat in their so called 'A/C Section'. The AC was not working and the ambience was dull. Its also a tiny place. The only thing that saved the day was the cricket match between India and Sri Lanka in which Rohit Sharma scored 264 runs. :D :P And the Chicken Manchow soup that my friend ordered. Quantity was okay. But the veggies in it were missing. It also had lots of chillies. Surprisingly, the chicken pieces in the soup were really nice and its quantity was also good. The Amritsari Chicken Masala was okay. The...read more"
"Yummy food,fast delivery!ordered a few indian dishes and all tasted different(rare with local restaurants)dint get time to visit them though hopefully shall do that soon!"
