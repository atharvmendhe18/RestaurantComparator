rice and manchurian both were stinking with the oil which was used...would never recommend this and would expect a refund for this food which was pathetic
very average taste like any routine restaurant. used to be very good before. has deteriorated over time. will think before ordering next time.

"The food was bland . Rice tasted weird, it was too watery/ overcooked ."
Thank you for delivering the food at 02.am
Found a stapler pin in my manchurian
Too much colour
excellent
not given Schezwan
"Very cheap quality of rice or making to fast due to so many deliveries.

Please give food according to the money is paid. If someone is paying you 300 he/she will accept that quality food.

Very bad and quality of making."
No cooking instructions followed. beans are there in fried rice.. even though clearly mentioned not to add...

"When it comes to Chinese i always prefer Raju's but since the last two times the quality and taste of food was not good at all....it was excessively oily and too much food color into it.
I guess this was my last order Raju's kitchen"

"Worst food I ever had in my life. it's supposed to be a fried rice not boiled rice. The rice was just boiled with the veggies, neither tossed a bit in the pan. You guy's fool your customers in such a way? I had ordered muliple times from Rajus's other locations but this one was the worst experience ever, if you want extra money take it but do serve the right food."
Worst ever - never order from this restaurant again in life ‚Ä¶. Pathetic
the packaging was wet and the food was way too cold
Very spicy
worst ever
