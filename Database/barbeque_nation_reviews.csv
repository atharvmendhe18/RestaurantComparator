Review
We had booked a different item and were delivered a very different item. But as it was very late so we couldn't return. Had to eat the material Delivered. Very unprofessional
"Food was not great and VERY late. Relieved a chicken biryani instead of veg biryani, we orded a veg thali. The chicken biryani wasn't even good. The portion size is small too, not value for money."
"not at all recommended.
not prppwrly bbq items.
main course tasteless"
"chicken was smelly, malabar roti too hard, butter chicken quality was poor"
"soggy starters, taste like re-heated."
"I really disappointed today when I had food, it was completely taste less, cold and dirty food. when I ate fish so I realized stone was there ,I think you guys sent me stale food . totally waste of money. I will never order food from this barbeque nation"
great
it's totally tasteless and cheap in taste. do not order
did not receive chocolate brownie
Dal Makhani was not fresh. It was smelly.
Very bad taste of this food. Human hair was found in Biriyani. Very pathetic and disgusting.
Complete waste of money. Food had no taste. Biryani was overcooked and tasted like khicdi instead. Putting boiled chicken in curry and biryani. Mint chutney tasted like having chalk. Pathetic experience!!!
Dude quantity already kafi kam hai atleast quality pe toh compromise mat karo.
it is more than enough for 2

"Half of the prawns pieces were burnt.
Fish pieces count was supposed to be 12 but weren't delivered. Have attached photo as evidence too. Taste was just okay but unhappy with quantity. Veg menu (potato) was excessively packed. Could've focused non-veg items as per obvious preference."
worst service from barbeque nation
The worst experience ever! The fish starter is pathetic and the chutney has no taste moong dal halwa was not exactly moong daal halwa It tasted like besan flour mixed with jaggery it feels like I spent money on boxes not on food
tell delivery the food was cold and the started was precooked and they heat the food and send it but the gravy tasted very good and the dessert was awesome!! the paratha was not flaky and it was also cold
"Paneer Tikka Missing, making fool"
