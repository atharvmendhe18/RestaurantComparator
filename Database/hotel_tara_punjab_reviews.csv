Would have given anything less than 1 . I have been here quite some times but offlate the service and quality has gone down big time. They serve hard drinks which are as old as 4 yrs and have great amount of spirit. Duplicate hard drinks harmful to drink. Food is stale as is compromised in quality. Person sitting at counter is very arrogant and uses abusive language if you complain

"Chembur ke Swastik chambers ke samne, Sion Panvel highway par sthit yah restaurant behtarin Uttar-bhartiya Vyanjan parosta hai. Unka Khana swadisht hai aur staff ke dwara di jaanewali service bhi badiya hai. Restaurant me baithne ki suviddha bohat acchi tarah se ki gayi hai."
"Hotel Tara Punjab is situated on Sion Trombay, opposite Swastik chambers. Hotel Tara Punjab serves quite good North Indian cuisine along with Chinese cuisine. Their menu is vast and service is quite good. Although food has good taste yet there's a room for improvement.
Overall vising Hotel Tara Punjab was kind of okayish experience for me."

"Good place to go out for drinks with friends.
Bombil Rava Fry, Tandoori Chicken Lolly pop is a must try in starters.

Desi Chicken (thick gravy) with chappati and half rice is ultimate in main course. It's Dal Khichdi and Chicken Dal Khichdi is also awesome."
"One of my best places to hangout with my friends . Decent rates for drinks and food.. ambience is good but restricted for family... Chicken tandoori is too good and also the free boilef black chana masala as complimentary, great service office goers this is your evening place ..."

The 2 dishes that I really love her is the dil kush kabab which is cooked in a clay pot with all the flavours enclaved in it the spices are perfect and the tandoori lollipop is delicious for two simple reasons there is no flour coating and it's purely only meet ..all in all a good punjabi joint!
This is a famous bar in chembur and serves good food with affordable drinks . Some of the speciality of this place are 1 Dal khichdi 2 any thing related to egg 3 chicken tandoori..
"So, while traveling from Chembur to Goregaon, I decided to stop by at Tara Punjab for lunch. And to my surprise, I felt proud of my sixth sense that I stopped here. The food is superb. As per the unsaid rule, almost every bar serves good food, specially Non Veg. We ordered Butter chicken and Rotis nothing more. But I loved the food. The ambience is ok. Service is good. And Food is superb."
One of the cheapest places for booze nearby. Becomes very crowded especially on Fridays and weekends. Must try their lipsmacking Surmai Rawa fry. Goes well with chilled beer.
Drinks are cheap like all local bars as you get beers by the bottle and whiskey/rum by the nip. Food is good especially non veg. Do ask for their special of the day.
Boiled 2 tym chiken tandoori still not boiled properly bey bad service...nd payment issue via debit card bt @still not issued by this resturant
Regular drinking joint. Been visiting here for quite some time now. Drinks are cheap like all local bars as you get beers by the bottle and whiskey/rum by the nip. Food is good especially non veg. Do ask for their special of the day.
"Its an OK place really, mostly more of a place for friends or colleagues to hang out over a few drinks rather than a family outing. The drinks are affordable, the bitings good, the food is fine, sometime can be a tad oily. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. 

The food, Starters are good, love the chicken tikkas and kababs that have. Main course is good, ambience is very casual. Can visit here with friends."
"An okay place to drink with college friends, but not for families. Food highly oily. I mean I ordered tawa fry fish and not deep fried. Chembur has better options for Punjabi or tandoori food. Check my other reviews."
"Tara Punjab or TP is a famous drinking joint in Chembur located near Chagan Mitha Petrol pump. Used to come here quite frequently when i was in college. They have an upper ac family section and non ac section. Personally prefer sitting in the ac area on the ground floor. Waiters there are quite efficient. This place serves some really delicious seafood. Mutton and Chicken starters are yum. Tandoori Prawns, Sukkha Mutton and Chicken Tikka are few of the starters we prefer. Chana masala is a good accompaniment with drinks. Service here is quick and staff is courteous. Prices are decent. The upper Family section has prices a bit on the higher side. The outside area is a good place to smoke...read more"
"The place is not one bit of what is looks from outside

Totally shady and dirty

With cheap crowd sitting plus its over priced

The food is OK OK

But the service is pathetic

The waiter actually said us to wait coz he wanted to watch IPL cricket match

Like cmmon you serious ???

Will not recommend this place to anyone

Please avoid and go some other place"
"This place is very famous amongst college going people in Chembur. Tara Punjab or TP, as it is popularly known has cheap alcohol and good non-veg starters"
This is popularly known as TP and is a hub for all VESITians after event parties. The best part here is the complementary boiled channa you get as chakna which is really tasty when mixed with chutney and ketchup . Reasonably priced alcohol with decent food and okayish ambience and women friendly occasionally sums up TP completely
I've tried the vegetable Biryani here. The quantity given is decent. The taste is also good. But please do not expect anything of the Hyderabadi taste in dum Biryani!
"Been there quite a few times. Food is good. Famous for punjabi food. Bhindi fry masala was out of the world. Staff were ok. Overall, above average."
"Not that great food..esp the Punjabi n moughlai dishes not up to the mark
The owner doesn't value customers who order home delivery..Twice it has happened that the delivery has been misplaced..think twice before ordering home delivery.."
"5 mins walking distance from my place. I always order home delivery since I cannot bring my family here. Though the ambience is not family Oriented, this dhaba managed by Kannads is just awesome. The food is super delicious. Though its named a dhaba, their Chinese items are very tasty( I am not talking from an authenticity POV). Pick anything from their menu and its good. Had it not been for their ambience, its a pretty good good joint.
Strictly recommended for home delivery. Keep up the good ""taste"""
"This is the first time I came to this place. Nice calm ambiance. It was afternoon when we arrived so not much of crowd. We were the only one who had come for lunch and treated reply royally.
The staff was really nice.

We ordered for tandorri chicken. Thought it took loads of time but worth it. The taste was amazing. Loved the tandorri chicken. It was crispy burnt at the edge but soft from outside and along with green chatni it tasted very well.
The chicken pullav was also amazing. We thought of ordering chicken briyani but wanted to go low on spices. So this was really a good option. Rice was cooked well. Even the chicken was cooked very well. The onions were fried and added to the...read more"

"Have been here quite a lot but we have stopped visiting this place coz the last time my team visited, all of them fell sick after eating there. This was a continuous thing as we normally get sick afyer having food here and hence a big no."
Excellent place...upper floor is awesome..........lounge area is also very good ???? chiken kalmi kabab must try........delicious food ???? very tasty ????
"Excellent place. Two kinds of ambience. Variety of food to go with the alcohol. I think the only one of its kind in this vicinity.
Service is excellent. Food is good. Suitably priced. Not a bad place to hangout on a Saturday. Crowd is also set."
I went here 4-5times . Food quality is so so.. Starters are good..but I found Chicken in main course items not tasty..n low quality type. And item rates are high compare to quality...
"This is like the hip version of its competitor i.e is Guru Prasad. Good ambience, awesome food and nominal rates for alcohol. Closes by 1.30 AM."
"Tara Punjab is a good one to celebrate your small parties wid your friends, including female friends as well, food- good, ambience- good, staff is OK."

Good place for family dine..liked it

"Good . Really good food.. The tag Tara Punjab is justified.. The upper floor of this hotel is for family and the lower section is for as they say quarter system.. The upper section is divided into 3 parts.. Fine dine.. Open dining and a small 6 table lounge.. Good one if you want to throw a party to family and friends ..
Must try chicken 65 and surmai fry as starter.."
