Review
"Great food with great view..
Best place in mumbai if you thinking for candle light dinner beach side with your gf or spouse but a little overly priced. Around 3000 for pax of two. But a place for a set romantic dinner."
I have given 4 star to it because of its extraordinary view but food over there is not that great .... we require reservation .....best place to go with your girlfriend on first date and click sexy pictures with sea and a beach view
"It was a candle light dinner for me & a surprise Dine-out by my wife, but actually I wasn't that much surprised with the food... But yes they have a good ambience with descent staff service."
One of the most beautiful places in Mumbai.. Too heavy on pocket but worth it.. Visit with ur date for perfect moments.. ;)
"The big buck place, one of the most classy, happening place in Juhu. The interior is elegant a bit dim, has both indoor and outdoor, sea facing.. worth it in winter and rains amazing view and windy on most days. I had been with my lady love and we got a special dish from the chef as a goodwill gesture. The service is good and staff is well informed. Many of the most happening Bollywood parties happen here and dont be surprised if the table next to you is occupied by a celeb. Overall a class experience."
"The Best part of this place is the view n ambience...simply beautiful.... But the breathtaking view comes with a price... super expensive...But worth the experience.... perfect for a romantic evening... V reached there late in the evening...but would suggest if u be there during sunset or little later, I am sure it will be simply awesome... They have indoor n outdoor sitting... but it is worth to sit outdoor only...hence Reservation is a must..."
"When you want to splurge, there can be no better. The view is absolutely amazing, and it should be because you are right on the beach, so much so that you can smell the occasional coal fired corn on the cobs being prepared for the beach goers, not a distraction but only enhancing the appetite. Seating plays a big role in the overall experience so do make a reservation and asked to be seated right next to the water. Food is excellent, from the presentation to the taste and the service provided by the wait staff is immediate and preemptive. A+"
Amazing place
"One of those places you might drive past without even noticing but once in, you think why haven't I come here before?.. Enjoys an enviable location and makes the most of it by offering a mesmerizing view of the Juhu beach treating you to a montage that you might not have enjoyed earlier.

Best visited just before sunset so you can enjoy it while sipping on your choice of poison. After sunset, you will be treated to a show of planes flying low, casting a silver hue over the waves. It's a show folks, and Aurus takes full advantage of it!

The food was good, albeit we found the portions a little less than expected. Not much choice for vegetarians and Pricey. Couple of drinks and a dinner...read more"
"The most amazing place to watch the sunset on a Sunday. It also helps that they have enough good food and alcohol to keep you happy. While its less relaxing as compared to Gada Da Vida, its definitely more exciting for those who uptempo music and loads of people (not really everyone's cup of tea). The ambience is brilliant and is something that gets missed thanks to that view."
"Lighting is the first impressive thing when you will enter Aurus. If you have never been here,it will be a bit difficult for you to find this place as they do not have any kind of display boards or any signage outside

For your assistance I will like to tell to that as soon as you reach juhu,you will notice some designer shops there. Ask anyone about Aurus and they will happily assist you

Food is delicious and ambience is literally amazing. Going with your partner will be a better option than with friends as it is more of a romantic place. Music is progressive and light. Stewards are good and probable manager will introduce the steward to you before they start serving (happened in my...read more"
Nice place to hangout!!
"Best ambience ever seen for a candle light dinner the sound of d waves can take over any soft music best place to be with your special one
Quite expensive though."
"Awesome ambience. The food is great but very expensive. Each portion is very small. But it's worth the experience.
Perfect for a special romantic evening.
If you get outdoor sitting.. You can have dinner by the beach.. Though its seldom open..
You can boast that you went to a star place as many famous ppl have parties here.

"Awesome place. Must visit. Chef Vicky Ratnani's menu is outstanding. Service is impeccable. Ambience is out of the world!
Only ruse - leaves a large dent in your pocket (deducting 0.5 points for that!!)"
"Romantic all the way....this place exudes romance as only a few in Mumbai can. Situated right next to the beach, the outdoor seating is obviously the location you would want to choose. People looking for a special date night can definitely look at this as option.
Food is typical Italian though the flavors will definitely appeal to the taste palate of many. The lack of spices n herbs brings out the taste in individual ingredient which for me was a refreshing experience.
Worth to go out for a special occasion!

Hope you find this useful! Bon Appetit! :))"
"Went to this place after raving reviews from my Mumbaikar friends... of course the view you get of Juhu beach is awesome and the music of waves soothing your nerves

The Menu is short and you get what you see on it. Paella was at its best, which i usually don't find this good in other restaurants.

The premium price is can be justified only for the view and alfresco dining midst the hyper crowded city

As the quantity they serve is lesser than what we get at other similar places, we kept on ordering, chatting n chilling out, till we noticed that we were the only bunch left and it was 2:30 AM ! the service was good .....its a great place to hang out with friends talking endlessly n...read more"
"Excellent ambience, but the food is soo soo, good place to have a drink by the sea, but it's too expensive in the end...."
"I visited Aurus after hearing and reading quiet a bit about Aurus on various social media platforms. My visit on a weekend evening.

In comparison to what has been written about this place, didnt find it as WoW as I found Aer or other Al fresco dining options. Another points the place is highly (over than highly) priced and I find no reason for it to be so. The outdoor section is quiet tiny compared to the pictures.

However if you have too much money to blow over (although there are many other places to blow it off at), you will find a posh yet comfortable seating with a great view (for almost each seat), friendly staff, watch the aircrafts landing and taking off and have a decent...read more"
"We went to Aurus on a dry day. So there was not much of an option available, However on the food part. We had specifically told that we need spicy stuff, There was 1 starter which was okay and the other one recommend by the staff was not at all spicy and had coconut all inside out.

To add to this when the bill arrived we were charged for the bottle of water. Which was specifically informed that we wanted regular water. The staff did not even bother to remove the charges when bought the same to their notice.
We paid for it. however not a good customer service provided. The main course was okay and patable...

Since the ambiance was great but effeminately not for the food, Other than...read more"
Location is pretty awesome rest is just good enough
"What a stunning place!
incredible ambiance, maybe the most romantic restaurant in Mumbai.
Did not have high expectations from the food, but it was delicious, classy food.
Service was not great and the place is really expensive, but, what the heck!
With soothing music, the breeze from juhu beach touching your face, candle light and fantastic drinks, the night can't get better than this.
P.S : I strongly recommend you to take the outdoor seating & make a reservation for it! Or, it gets full. Even on a weekday!"
"Ambience was damn good.
I would say go for a romantic date but food was damn different n okay okay.

Evening breeze damn awesome and view of juhu beach was mind blowing.

I would suggest get a resevation for outside table you will love it ."
"Hi Friends, Must Visit Place..
Beautiful Interiors, Outstanding Choice on Decor, courteous staff. good food, sometimes splurging makes you feel good :-)
frequently visited place by the top film dom, should you wanna rub shoulders with a few of them, pls drive down to Juhu Tara Road..
Recommended Place for celebrating Anniversaries, Love is in Air !!!
Guess, their 2014 - Feb 14th bookings must have already started."
"I visited this place after reading good reviews but not much was to my liking!First,people shouldn't be really allowed to smoke within the restaurant and lounge because it pollutes the fresh sea breeze and feels really suffocating with all the burning smell!I think they feel if they don't keep a separate smoking zone it'll be favourable amongst the trashy crowd but it's a turndown for classy Me...Secondly the beach view is great and so is their service and the little gestures of offering you shawl if it's too chilly,politeness and stuff but the food's quality incredibly sucks!!I loved the flavours of Paprika Cream Grilled Baby Lobster,the sauce served beside the rice was really...read more"
Amazing ambience and the sea face feel but equally bad on food.
"Just an expensive place to blow up money... food is average...
Only good thing is sea facing restaurant..."
"Ambiance is amazing. Very frendly staff with good service. Food is again fantastic. This place is little overpriced. But the place is worth experience. If u are thinking to go out on a romantic date then this is a place, believe me."
"Awesome views and great ambience. Food and drinks are way overpriced. While I would recommend people to definitely pay Aurus a visit, it still would be, in my opinion, an overhyped place."
I visited the place with reservation and got a good seating. The view is definitely top class. Not sure if the same can be said about food and drinks. My husband and I had ordered Long Island iced teas. He got his without alcohol. So we had to request them to check alcohol and they confirmed our doubt. The LIIT was ok. Nothing great. we ordered rosemary chicken which was ok again hyped too much. We found the chicken to be quite rubbery. I ordereda risotto which was again ok. I think the place is over hyped because of the view. Needs to re-look at what theys erve for the money they charge.
"The seaside area especially the sea facing seating with the candle light, calm and the sea breeze make excellent location for a romantic late night dinner."
"Amazing food, the prawns are especially good.
Only one thing, they could improve the entrance, my parents started doubting my taste when they saw it. But when you go inside It's superb."
Amazing venue to be on a date ...decent food ....good crowd ..good music ..and an excellent place to enjoy some special time with special person..
"Romantic ambience ... Excellent food ..
Worth it ... This place is very nice but prefer to sit outside and enjoy the lovely sea along with food... Enjoy!"
"Ambience is amazing, foods half decent. Then again you don't visit such places to hog. Beauuutiful beachside sitting, delectable music and good crowd. Quite a 'date' venue, not meant for the casual 'chilling' scenes with friends."
"Its gives a different feeling when you visit here.. Food and Drinks are also good. Courteous and friendly server. Not very exclusive interior. Over all very good experience. Amazing food and great place for eating with family and even better for Business Meetings and eatings.
The Ambience is pleasant, with a great view of the city and the location of the restaurant is very well connected to the rest of the city ."
"This was the first place I visited in Mumbai and I was just speechless with the view. Situated on the beach side, this is a perfect place for a romantic evening ( specially if you get the beach facing tables). Dim lights, subtle interiors just add to the romantic mood.

I dont remember the food we ordered( it was long time ago) but the only thing I noticed was that the quantity was on the lower side in most of the dishes. Drinks were reasonably priced and yes not to forget, best mojito i have had in Mumbai.

It might be heavy on your pocket but definitely worth a visit."
"Aurus is located in the heart of Mumbai, Juhu nicely tucked amidst some of the famous names in the Food & Beverages business.You may have to keep a look for this one, its easy to miss this considering its not so attractive exterior but once you enter this place is heaven. In terms of ambiance this is the best I have seen so far, candle-lit lounge dining area overlooking the beauty of beautiful beach and relaxing sound of the wave. What else, do you want...it is peaceful, romantic (especially if you are on a date).

Food happens to be my favorite Asparagus Soup - Along with Bread Basket and Cheese Dip, Jamaican Chicken (Mocktail - average), & mouth-watering cheesecake...I haven't tasted...read more"
"Best place I ever found in Mumbai. Specially best for dating a girl with candle night dinner. This is one of my unforgettable place in Mumbai. Dinning at Aurus is inspiring as view, what a beach side view . Classic and hidden place, even it is difficult to find even u r standing in front of main gate. Rhythm and blues music adds further silkiness to this place. This place become seductive by dim light candles and romantic music. Food quality was good and variety of drinks also . Most amazing place , atleast try once with your loved ones."
"Simply superb. Ambience is the winner. If you are in love, this place is a must visit.
Romance is in the air, around you, in the breeze, the candles and the music. This is what Lounge experience should be.
Yes it is expensive, but then great experiences will come with a price. Guys, If you wish to impress the lady on your first date, bring her here. She will be floored."
"One of the best restaurant for ambience. Amazing food & service too.
Bit costly but worth for money.
Must visit"
Perfect place for a date!! Make sure to reserve your table.
amazing place!!!but there is no jain food!!!i loved d place!!
"Good food but ambience was a disappointment due to monsoons.
Deserts has limited options ..

Good service other wise."
One of the amazing place for dining. A great ambience to add to amazing food. It's difficult to search the place from outside. Inside its totally different. The staff was courteous too.
"An amazing place to spend with your loved ones! A recommended place for romantic evenings!

Great Ambience! Nice piece of music played! Candle-Light had its effect and charm !


。Finding the place was a bit tough part, no signboards!
。Service is a bit slow, which SHOULD be improved!
。Veg Food is ok ok ! No special Veg dishes!

Drinks - 4/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Service - 3/5
Hygiene - 4/5"
"Trip 1- It started with a call to reserve a table for Wednesday night. Was told that I should have called in advance for a table outside. When I asked if I could get a table inside instead I was told that would be possible. Reached at 8:30pm and was greeted by a sea of valets who informed me that the place was booked for a private party and we wouldn't brle allowed to enter.
Trip 2- Called again the next day for a reservation and complained of the previous encounter. Was told that everyone calling was informed of the private booking!!!! Still decided to give the place another shot and made a reservation. Was told that only a couch would be possible as all tables are booked.When we reached...read more"
"A beautiful sea view, accompanie by great music with your loved one, its the place to be on a quiet romantic evening. Its been ages since my last visit, but the memories are still fresh with soft flowing breeze as the waves crashed on the rocks, the food and cocktails were delicate and delightful."
"A fabulous to be at. Exceptional food, awesome ambiance and the breeze from the sea topping it all. We were a group of friends hesitating to dine at Aurus, considering the high prices, but the food delivered to us took us by wonder. One of my friends had the Bass Fillet and were all praise about it. I had the Lamb Cutlets and they were extraordinary, but I wish there was more on the plate! They also have a lot of wines to choose from, we chose Chardonnay. We returned with optimum satisfaction and hope that the excellent service of Aurus is maintained."
"This place is well known and I wanted to visit here for a long time. A well known lounge bar you expect good bar food an lousy Main course. This place lives upto its review at least food wise. For soup I had the Fire Roasted Tomato Bisque with Pumpkin for main course the Roulade of Spring Chicken and for dessert the Lindt Chocolate Volcano. The choice I made was well made and tasty. The char grilled basa is also a good choice. The Vegetarians can try the Blackened Cottage Cheese or the Sun dreid Tomatoes and basil Risotto.
Service was a bit lacking as the waiters were slow and confusing orders though the were courteous and well behaved. Also thankfully they did not make mistakes.

"good risotto, but small portions of starters.
you'd feel hungry once ur back home.
amazing ambience though."
"Awesome place and awesome service. Just loved it. If you want to have a great evening, make sure to mention while reserving that you need a table outside facing the sea and I was told that it is very difficult to get a table outside and you need to reserve it at least two days in advance. I had made a reservation on the day I was supposed to go but the staff there were kind enough to make arrangements for us outside facing the sea till the guests arrived who had made the reservations. One of the best places in Mumbai to spend an evening with your loved one. Good drinks and appetizers."
"If a place has been 'Over-hyped' its got to be Aurus.

After reading all the reviews and and seeing the pictures posted here, I thought this would be the idle place to celebrate my birthday.

There is no signboard indicating its location, after some asking around found the place, not a complete minus, but it would be good to be able to spot the place for yourself instead of having to ask multiple people.

After we got in they showed us to our place which was indoors and they have packed the indoors with tables, if anyone sits next to your table it will be more like sharing the same table.a total put off. They we asked the manager if we could get a seating outside, he told us it was...read more"
"I am from Pune and I often visit Mumbai to spend time with my cousins. It was my first visit to Aurus, last month. As I entered I was welcomed with the sound of waves, and immediately fell in love with the ambience. Music, sea and European cuisine are my types of things and being a Friday, Aurus was hosting a DJ Night. As recommended by the friendly staff, we ordered for lamb chops along with Merlot wine and it was truly a delightful combo. At Aurus, I truly had one of the best dining experiences. A high five from me!"
"Work brings me to Mumbai every now and then, and every time I am in the city, I ensure that I visit Aurus. This is one of my favourite places. I love the food and the setting. Be it a corporate outing or a leisure time with friends, Aurus is the right place. I love the way they experiment with their drinks menu and Lamb Sliders is my favourite dish there. I highly recommend this place."
"Let me start my saying I love this place ! This is the only joint in Mumbai that has marinated their food, music & clientele...A lot of places have come & gone, but Aurus has always lived up to the reputation
I would start with food as this is ideally a dine-in joint. The place is known for its seafood & amazing chef's specials. The jumbo grilled prawns and rosemary chicken are to die for ! The appetizers really ignite your taste buds & are filling enough to let you go with your main-course. I wouldn't recommend deserts, as it is not really their forte. I have tired almost all of them - but the NY cheese cake is the worst. It taste nothing like it should be i.e. creamy & soft with a...read more"
"Awesome ambience to begin with. That would drive a person here everyday sitting beachside and having a nice cocktail but their prices would drive them out as well.
Food was okay not that great. Though I had been here a while ago so hope they would have improved a bit.
Perfect place for a romantic candle light dinner."
"Visited the place during the Restaurant Week Apr 2013. While the ambience is just fantastic and mind-blowing, the food is very ordinary. I cannot imagine paying full price for the food, even for an awesome place to sit. There are few places in the city which will offer better ambience. The drinks and desserts were good. Go there for a drink during sunset. If you plan to go there for food, plan some place else."
"Absolutely loved this place..Outdoor sitting with juhu beach view is awesome..The lighting, candle light, music compliment to that ambience."
"Had long since thought of coming here but never got an opportunity.Thanks to Restaurant Week ended up here for a three course meal.This place is easy to miss if you havent been here before.

On arrival we offered with option of outdoor or indoor seating.Needless to say we chose the outdoor one.You will miss out on a whole lot if you sit indoors.The ambiance was mindblowing to say the least. Roamntic lighting,comfortable couches,lone candle on the table,mild breeze and the rushing sound of the sea.Simply AWESOME!!!

"The only trouble you'll get is to find it. There is no banner or board, it is next to Samsonite outlet. They have Valet parking facility. And once you're there you'll hardly face any trouble.

It is a must visit place, A restaurant which is sea facing, open air, it becomes even better during the night time with candle lights, soothing music, cool breeze and delicious food served with all courtesies. A perfect place to date, recommended for all couples."
Good food. Nice ambience. A nice byt expensive way to have a romantic dinner.

"Rocky's Carnivorous review - Taste: 4.5/5 - I started with the 'Coastal Crunch' salad with spicy Cajun prawns, crunchy calamari and a host of textures and flavors blended well. The 'Lamb Sliders' are delightful small burgers big on taste. The Angus steak was a fine cut and very tender. With meat this good I had it done 'rare' and was gratified with the taste. The 'Manali trout ""Amandine""' was delicate and truly masterfully done. In full disclosure I declare that Chef Vicky Ratnani is a good friend, don't tell him but this review is not so good because he's a friend but he's a friend because of how good his food is heh heh heh. The Cheesecake is legendary and a must have. If you...read more"
"We had our reunion party here and I may have been pretty dumb of not knowing the existence of this awesome place. Yup, it did drill my pocket and that too quite a bit, but I wouldn't crib much for the experience I had. The cocktails were great but what I loved the most was the appetizer Jamaican Chicken... Ever since I am back from Aurus, I have been singing praises for this beautiful seaside restaurant, but I would have screamed louder with praises had Aurus been a bit pocket friendly."
"Dining by the Sea
Best mushroom soup ever
Loved the side breads the served too
The Cocktails are innovative
Dream setup. The inside area awwws you & the outside wowws you ..
The chicken stuffed pasta & the fish risotto are delectable
The signature molten chocolate & banofie pie end a perfect date meal
Mumbais class act destination for dining"
"Not at all a place for Non Drinkers or a Date....
Only thing is that its in front of sea and you hardly see anything at night time.
Service is Super Slow, I had more expectations in terms of Service and Food but its average.
Music is Loud, You can't Talk.
Seating Outside is Not so Comfortable, Except the Bed Outside which unfortunately we couldn't occupy. We had to sit on Wooden Chairs with No Cushions which was quite low.
I have been to better places before, so for me its a NO for future."

"Among the high end restaurants Aurus is for sure one of the best in Mumbai. Right from service to food and the best part is the ambiance. If you visit Aurus make sure you have the outdoor seating, its a completely different experience. Sitting indoors is like just another high end restaurant."
"Location, Location, Location - Aurus, it probably couldn't get better. Candle light dinner, open air and by the beach, things cant get much better. Food is good, music is great for the mood. You definitely need to have reservations especially for a weekend. Perfect location for a special occasion

Negatives
- While the stretch of beach is clear, the sea is Mumbai is not known to be the cleanest. So especially for people from outside Mumbai the smell could get overbearing
- While the restaurant does a good job combatting the mosquitoes, on a rare occasion, mosquitoes win.

They do have an indoor area to negate the above two points, but then its like any other restaurant. The menu and the...read more"
"If you are planning for a romantic dinner with your partner then I would recommend you Aurus. Perfect ambiance, good food and nice staff."

"Been here a couple of weeks before for the food festival......Excellent place for a date especially candle light dinners......Jazz music, romantically lit ambience and the wine just sets the mood n with the view of the sea ahead of u nothing can go wrong with it.....A bit pricey but definitely worth the experience.....Food n service was excellent no complaints at all....Have to mention the staff is very very co operative with seating u prefer or the food from the menu u wanna order for...Thanks for the wonderful experience guys will really recommend this to my friends...cheers!!!"
Dining by the sea is surely the best thing to do and Aurus is the only restaurant in Juhu which gives you this opportunity. Aurus is very calm & awesome place with good music. This place is worth trying for all Mumbai food lovers.
"An amazing place facing the Clean portion of Juhu Sea, really nice Music with lovely selection of wines, you can sit back have thier amazing starters with lovely international selection of Rose wine. You might bump into quite a few Bollywood celebrities there. Its expensive but worth a visit for the Ambiance and wines!"
"Classy, out of this world with the most indulgent food!

Perfectly relaxed and un hurried. Makes sense if you wanna go there to gaze into each other's eyes, over to the sea or even at the moon!"
"the outdoor seating area is where all the action is at this stylish, cozy, romantic restaurant.
Right by the beach couches with a dimly light exterior, you can hear the waves of the ocean (even if you cant see anything) its probably one of the most romantic restaurants in Mumbai and kills every other restaurant on the basis of sheer ambience. Apt for a date night.
The food is great. There's a lobster starter( i dont remember its name, tch!) which really stood out. Cocktails are good. Courteous staff. Reservations are a must if you want to sit outside (which is where you should sit)."
"Divided into two sections, an indoor seating and an outdoor seating which faces the Juhu Beach, Aurus is one of the most popular lounges in the suburbs. If you don't want to be disappointed, ensure you make a reservation well in advance."
Pathetic place .....and zomato has removed my previous review of dis place which was 3 mnths bac and hav reviews which r 10mnth old jus coz dey said a few good things.....like ppl have d right to like dis place likewise ppl.who.were dissapointed hav a right to voice deir opinion.....dats d whole point of having a review section in d first place isnt it??
