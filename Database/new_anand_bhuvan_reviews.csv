"New Anand Bhuvan is a 64-year-old establishment which has made a name for itself on the dint of only 1 dish, MISAL PAV.

It is a smallish place with about 4-6 tables and serves very limited dishes on their menu; some of which are available only at certain times.

I ordered the MISAL which is made up of white peas, some farsan in a dry coconut-based red gravy. At face value, the gravy seems to be fiery but actually, it isn't so. I found it to be slightly spicy and manageable.

Also tried the Batata Wada which was also nice & served with a red chutney, which I suspect is also used in the MIsal gravy.

New Anand Bhuvan offers a pocket-friendly meal & a decent taste for the buck."
"Food: The famous misal experience they serve here made me visit New Anand Bhavan. After gorging on their delightful misal ( a delectable mixture of Gujarati farsan, nuts, pulses and a flavoured 'tari' ), I have only one thing to say. The misal earns it's name.

Ambiance: A local fast food restaurant. Steel tables and benches.

Service: Quick.

Value for money: $$"
"good place to eat misal paav. menu is very limited. specialty is misal paav. misal was tasty. quantity was satisfying. reasonable, pocket friendly food. must go place for misal lover's."

‚ÄúNew Anand Bhuvan‚Äù one of the oldest and hidden gem of Mumbai which is popular for serving hot and spicy Misal Pav. This place is located just next signal to the main Lalbaug signal.

This was on my bucket list since long time as my dad had recommended it.

It‚Äôs a tiny outlet with limited seating option of 6 to 7 tables.

The Menu of this place is limited and restricted mostly to Misal, Usal, Batata Vada, Kanda Bhaji and Vada Usal etc.

We tried out following from the menu:-
‚Ä¢ Misal Pav:- It‚Äôs a top ordered dish at this place. Spicy and tasty. Must have one.
