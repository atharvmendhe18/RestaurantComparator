very very oily
"Overall the food quality was good, portion size was adequate, and delivery time was reasonable. but despite giving clear instructions not to, they added cauliflower to the biryani. So ""average"" review."

"We have asked for cheese in maysore masala. And there is no cheese at all

It was look like msala dosa dish not maysore masala dosa


Sambar i liked the most
Thank you"
Portion sizes are adequate. Bhindi masala is too oily. Roti was somewhat rubbery. I did not get buttermilk that I'd ordered.
bakvas

"Delivery review: The whole experience was horrible. The packaging was not good. The food came in a plastic bag with oil leaking and manchurian gravy came in a silver foil bag. Not only this, but the food tasted bad. The soyabean chilli dry was uncooked and had no flavour. The triple schezwan fried rice and manchurian gravy and manchurian balls in it, all tasted bad! Very disappointed!
DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM HERE!"

"Rude staff whoever manages the delivery calls. Doesn't have the manner to speak to their customers. Should Improve the staff and their way of responding. Early year it use to be a very nice place but maybe because of other good restaurants around them they have lost their mind from the business. And maybe that's the reason. Food has also turned to be very pathetic and compared with the pricing it's not at all worth. Good thing is their are other better restaurants around so you got options.
Food - 4/10.
Worth - 5/10.
Politeness - 0/10"
"need some salt and should be less oily .

Food not trustworthy. Especially Jain food orders always contain onion and garlic. Food causes acidity as well.

"A very good place to have a meal, clean place, tasty food and good south Indian dishes (Dosa, Uttapam, idli etc). they also serve main course, i.e North Indian food as well as few more others.

"One more bang on mid range and fast food house in bhandup.
Good place to have food with your friends.
Mid range dishes and delicious and lip smacking food

Loved the way they serve you
Good
No complaints
Must visit"
One of the best place in Bhandup to eat veg.The place is famous for their North Indian food but apart from that other items are also superb.The prices are also pocket friendly
"À good pure vegetarian restaurant in bhandup, tasty food belonging to South indian, Maharashtrian, punjabi, continental.
Excellent service, excellent food, would surely love to visit the place again."
Not a gud experience. They put too much garlic in almost all their dishes but when Feedback was given .... It was not taken positively. They instead argued. Wont ever visit again. Needs massive improvement. I have at least visited this place five to six times and it has been pretty average. Bill copy attached.
Okay okay service also the pav bhaji here is nice. Do try. The staff is okay. Ambiance is not that great. Casual dinner place nothing like fancy
Good place for vegetarians.Ambience is good and food is also very tast.Quality with quantity gives you a reason to visit this restaurant.Dal khicdi one of my favorites.
"The place is easy to locate.North Indian food is good,the staff is friendly.It is a good place for family time and the prices are average.
Food;4/5
Staff;5/5
Price;4/5"
"Good place to eat... Family time. ... !!
North Indian food is good here...
Located at Bhandup west... Easy to find its on the lbs road.
Co operative staff."
"For some south indian food, try out this restaurant. We had their dal khichdi which is good for kids not too spicy and is spiced well. Ordered veg fried rice and schezwan veg noodles. Both these dishes were good. Overall food was average and it does give a south indian flavor."
"It's a family restaurant it has both the sections ac & non-ac which ever you like. Food is also good. Had a nice experience, we mostly visit there"
Family reaustrant. Bhandup less choice so this is good place. Near to my house. Staff are very good. They provide home delivery. Good place to visit
"I generally don't write reviews, but I am writing this so that the restaurant staff can make a note of it. The food taste and quality need to be improved. I had my dinner an hour ago but my jaw and head are still paining coz it took efforts to chew the roti. We ordered paneer pyaza in main course but the contents rather fit a starter and the dish was nothing but 5-6 paneer pakodas n rest onion pakodas served with a gravy. I couldn't figure out whether we ordered paneer as a base or onion as a base. Dear chef, you really have to work on your dishes."
"Good place to have regular food. Simple food. Good taste.
Reasonable price. Affordable to everyone. Always crowded place. Road touch. Visit many time."
South Indian breakfast is too good here. I visited this place 2 time and both the time service was fantastic. Veg lahori was super awesome. I'll like to visit again
"A pretty decent place to grab a snack . I live the masala dosa , and grilled cheese sandwich here . The staff and sitting arrangement is pretty relaxed . Waiter and management is very polite . It serves good quality food ,taste and quantity is just average . Would not recommend eating Chinese here as its pretty ok . Snacking , breakfast and punjabi items is much preferred . It's also a good place to order food from ."
Excellent Udupi restaurant in Bhandup. Variety of South Indian food available which are delicious. Am a big fan of medu vada sambar n rava dosa.
Not expected such bad food from Aditya Veg. We had cheese pulao which was so tasteless and dry we asked for a fresh dish. Fresh dish was even more worse and dish was also over priced since last time we ordered.
"Extremely #courteous staff.
#Total #ValueForMoney
Only when the #hotel gets full, the #delivery #time suffers.
As for the #food, it's extremely #hygienic
Don't #forget to #return the #smile from the hotel staff"
Tasty veg food. Various veg starters. Good quality food. Have ac non ac both. Serves good quality and quantity food. Family place. We tried veg Crispy in starter whose quantity was good enough.
The quality of food was very bad. Even the service was worst. The staff there was least bothered if at all water was served. I would not suggest anyone to visit this place
"Aditya Pure Veg is an Udipi-styled restaurant. I eat here regularly because it is close to where I live. While the management tries to position the restaurant above the ordinary Udipi restaurants by not serving thalis, using white plastic plates instead of metal plates, serving some of their breakfast items on banana leaf, etc.; the food itself is at best ordinary. The restaurant also does not always deliver home, they are usually short-staffed in the afternoon."
Oveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer priced!!. Also the ambience and taste is a total disaster and is not worth the money. If you are planning to have dosa. I will suggest you to try the bikaner shop near it. You can only take away but you will definitely save some money and tastes much better!!
"Hotel Aditya Vej, It is small restaurant, I usually go there because my office is there nearby. Usually I go there during my lunch time.Chinese food is great. Good place for lunch. North Vegetable dishes are good. I usually ate pavbhaji here. Food quality is awesome. But I think they charges little more. 2 pav bhaji with 4 extra pav cost around 300.
At last its like ""Pav bhaji gst maar ke""."
The quick go to restaurant for me for a quick and filling meal as it's right next to my home. It's one of those places which never disappoint in terms of the variety and the taste of the food. I have lost count the number of times I have been or ordered from here.
"So, this restaurant serves brilliant and cost effective veg food. For bachelor's, this place is boon as you get variety. We specially like dal khichdi, Panner satay and dal tadka."
"There are few restaurants where you can hop in anytime, have any dish and you won't be disappointed and luckily Aditya is one of them.. Located at lbs marg at this place serves all meals prepared deliciously. Be it any cuisine, this place won't disappoint you either you go for a quick snack or a proper meal"
"Very good for vegetarian food especially if you are near Asian paint. Service is average but food is tasty. I have tried veg crispy as starter, paneer makhanwala, paneer kadai, veg briyani and butter Nan."
"This was the lowest rating because there is nothing below it to give. Had eaten masala dosa in dinner . Asked for finger bowl as they were giving to others. They declined saying they give it only if u eat Punjabi dishes. What is this ? Will never go there again and neither recommend to anyone either.

Hospitality apart, taste was very very average and price was more than moderate.

Big No !"
"The food is awesome.I have order Jain crispy and its too tasty and also Jain paneer tikka masala.Jain Handi,Jain Paneer Kadai is too tasty. I love the food and service is also nice. All the food they are providing hot and with max quantity. So you tried it for Jain people specially."
Very bad Service i have ordered dal khichdi and the dal khichdi was so poor the dal was not cooked and the veg kolhapuri was so pooor i didn't like that so poor and wastage of money no ratings for thus hotel
"Nice place on LBS Marg just opposite Asian Paints to have snacks like Dosa, Batata Wada, Pav Bhaji etc. Batata wada with sambar in the mornings is one of the best snacks you can have. Other main course items are also OK to have in the evenings"
"I have been having food at this place for ages now and I felt it's due for its review. The things that you should expect here is the typical veg hotel food. Their menu has a blend Udipi , Punjabi and street food like Pav Bhaji etc. Today u stopped for breakfast . We had upma and puri Bhaji . Good. The upma was extremely oily and I had to leave it half way. The puri Bhaji was surprisingly nice and less oily. Thier Pav Bhaji is also good."
Dont go by rating....it was a sudden decision to go for Aditya instead of Bagicha and turn out a nice choice. ..we ordered punjabi food like paneer kadai n one veg dish which was good.
"The food is very okay, the ambience is okay but the service is really bad. They take a lot of time to get your order. But if you visit this place, you should try thread paneer."
"Been here several times, good options for veggies. though over priced compared to the serving portion. 
south Indian items are worth trying."
I have tried home delivery options in the South Indian menu and it is good. The lassi is also good. They deliver till late in the night (almost till 11pm) so that helps. Overall a good local eatery for some quick bites.
"Hankering for Chole Bhature took me here many times in the past. The ac section is a better option when ordering food since its quiet with better tables. The food is mediocre at best but along for something good in veg is a difficult proposition to begin with.

The service is decent, cleanliness needs improvement and it's quite economical. If you are looking for pav bhaji, idli sambar or veg it's fine for a quickie.

Don't go in expecting gastronomic fare"
"For those who want a good decent meal or catch a few bites in a hurry without burning a hole in the pocket, this place is it. Decent menu options, value for money, basic set up, and good waiters. The kitchen cleanliness looks good from the hygiene view, south indian fare is really good, main course is good too. Have their masala chaas which has a good hint of ginger and spice masala. Veg Kheema is good and so is the two in 1 vegetable ( forgot the name). Dont expect a fine dine feel...but good enough. The cons are - They have to upgrade a bit in their setting, the interiors too need to be more warm and classy, and must go with time in terms of taste and overall service."
"Typical neighborhood restaurant. Decent food at decent prices. Nothing bad about them - being in the same society, it's the 1st restaurant that comes to mind when I want a quick bite."
"We went there to have their Pav bhaji, which we heard was really good. Unfortunately, was a bit disappointed.

Their serving portion is below average. The taste was quite bland. It seemed like they were catering to people who cannot stand even bit of spice. Looking from cost vs quality standpoint, it's below average."
"Have been to this place couple of times, Nargasi kofta and Shyam Savera is my favourite. Chinese starters are also amazing, Manchurian balls, paneer chilli are few to name for..."
From outside it looks like a very casual dining place but there AC seating area is good and gives you a feel of fine dining area . Like any other veg restaurant this too has various menu option of multiple cuisines. I find this place as good family dining restaurant.
"Nice place for casual dinner either with family or friends. Service is fast, waiters are polite, food is good. They accept Ticket Restaurant coupons also."
Ordered paneer butter masala.... Butter naan and veg jalferizi .. Taste was really good. Price is also ok as per quality of food they deliver. Overall good experience. Vegi u can opt this place..
