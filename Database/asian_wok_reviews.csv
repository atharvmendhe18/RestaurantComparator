this is not the rice I had ordered for
soup was not prepared properly. taste less.
the rice was good but the amount of Schezwan chutney they give is horrible!! I mean look at the below picture. you guys please get a larger portion of dip bowl for sending condiments. this is ridiculous

"Delicious and healthy, filled with veggies"
"packaging should be improved, my box got damaged during the delivery"
One of the best place in Powai area for Chinese food. A must try if you haven’t tried it yet.

All good about it. Indian twist to the dish was surprisingly good
Wrong order
Super spicy plus uncooked. Can’t get worse. This used to be a decent restaurant but lately has been disappointing. Need to correct

Chibese was a bit spicy

"we have been ordering from Asian Wok for many years. this order especially was very pungent and spicy. it was like eating spices and sauce. the noodles/veggies were added for the name sake. very oily too. But bao was good.

please get back to your usual quality."

"Tom Kha is a white coloured with some floating chilli oil as given in the Tom Yum soup photo in the menu - chicken Tom yum and Kha soup photo interchanged in menu. We received a orange coloured soup similar to red Thai curry colour, the taste nowhere near Tom Kha soup"
"I ordered a white coconut based soup as given in the menu photo, I got a orange spicy soup. It appears the photo in the menu for Tom Kha and Tom yum have been interchanged"

Too salty
"bug leg came together
and I think you even dont know what is pho"

Didn’t give the fried noodles with the manchow soup!
Mojito and curry both came in bad condition
"no prawn cracker served with it
got only one prawn skewer"
The food was extremely spicy. Not at all consumable for a normal person.
Eveything was tasteless
Fraud giving 1 plate and taking 2 plates order
"Delicious, absolutely recommended"

Too spicy. Oriental Fried Rice should not be so spicy.

Slightly excess salt. Otherwise good taste

Paneer quality was very bad. It was like I’m eating rubber
first they mess up the order and send wrong one and on top of that chicken was old which tasted very bad. the fried rice was also really bad
"Had ordered chiken triple fried rice, but there was NO Chiken in it, also the gravy had cauliFlower instead of Chiken piece, Food was just made spicy with Lot of Chilli powder spreaded on it. Might be there understanding that Food will be tasty. It was around 10:00 while having our dinner time hence there was no option rather than eating, as food is God and we didnt wanted to insult because of Zomato. Just not the way Zomato should treat to its Gold Partner."
Crispy veggies are cooked in very bad quality oil
