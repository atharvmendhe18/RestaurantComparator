aloo jeera had too much garlic and dal makhani was too oily and with mixed daal
""

It was mixed with sweet dahi. not the authentic
""
Paneer bhurji and portion size size was good enough. Zomato total bill becomes very expensive at the end.
It was no where close to calling a Biryani. Pathetic taste.
""
The soup was so salty that i had to throw it away and could not drink it. terrible.
godd experience for anna Panjabi restaurant good service
tasty food
no kulfi just liquid
"This people don‚Äôt understand, the difference between Fruit salad and Fruit salad with custard, they did not also tell about the difference, the arrogant shopkeepers took money for it also insults me telling me from which village I have eaten they may call that fruit salad without custard as fruit salad but here in Mumbai fruit salad means with custard. Such a reputed restaurant so arrogant staff especially the manager.
For such mediocre food on top of that."
"food quality was worst and quantity of neer dosa is only 1, same dish in same hotel will gate more and with best quality"

Worst taste of food won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone
The total experience was Fantastic. Food was Great and will Surely order Again and Againüëçüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Too oily .. worst dal makhani I ever had
""
A little expensive in my opinion but good taste and quality so it's fine
It takes 60 mins on a Friday afternoon for just simple panner sabzi and roti....It's as worse as Brahmashtra.....
""
Please make segregation in Tandoori Roti and Tawa Roti.
Gravy is excess but chana is in less quantity
""
"extremely poor food, their quality has really gone down. change in chef?"
Quality is ok but quantity is very small always.

Quantity of papad is üëé

"So today we visited Anna Punjabi restaurant . It is Just 10 minutes away from chakala metro station . So their main concept revolves around thier south indian food and north indian food . This is a pure veg family restaurant . They have a great indoor seating Ac & Non- Ac both available . So the first thing we tried was their rawa sada dosa it tasted so good , the dosa was a bit crispy and thier Sambhar and chutney was too die for . Second we tried thier idli Sambhar , as soon as they served it the smell of thier idlis ahh it was so good . It is a very good place for you to visit with your friends , family & loved ones . A must visit restaurant üòÑ."
