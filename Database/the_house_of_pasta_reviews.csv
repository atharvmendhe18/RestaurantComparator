"Taste was not good as well as i ordered it when i was not at home, they didn’t send basic cutlery for eating a pasta… the packing was very good but whats the use if a person cannot eat it any way ? I mean would you eat pasta with your hands ?"

The Pastas here are so creamy and delicious. They have launched limited edition Pastas which I really liked and have rich taste. Pasta rosatella and pasta pomodoro were creamy yet tasty. And also the cheesecake I absolutely loved it. Super smooth it will just melt into your mouth.

The quantity of pasta was a bit less than usual and the box also wasn’t packed properly. The complimentary garlic bread which comes seemed stale as when i took a bite stale smell came from the bread . Today’s order was a complete mess

we had paid for extra ingredients such as brocolli and mushroom but there was hardly any mushroom. The amount of corn was not much either. The size of the garlic bread was too small and there was no garlic paste. The garlic bread tested like regular bread. it was not crispy. The portion was good and the food tasted very tasty. The restaurant provided red chilli flakes and oregano flakes. This was my 1st time ordering pasta ever from The house of pasta.
amazing taste & good quantity
"Craving some delicious pasta? Look no further than House of Pasta - it’s a pure veg cafe with over 20 mouth-watering varieties starting at just Rs. 220! From a humble food truck start, they now have two bustling outlets in Kandivali and Malad. Trust me, it's a pasta paradise 🍝🤤 I tried their Penne Mama rosa, Spaghetti in Alfredo, Pizza in Kulcha, Paneer garlic bread, green apple mojito and cold coffee. Loved every bute and sip of everything 🫠🤌🏻"

"Worst pasta I have ever had. Don't be fooled by their name. They have no clue what they are doing.

Never ordering again."

"yummy ,the taste which I was looking for."

Super spicy food given… pathetic food
"The Bolognese pasta was so overloaded with cheese and overall inedible. As a result, we have got food poisoning. I strongly recommend good hygiene in food preparation. Terrible experience."
