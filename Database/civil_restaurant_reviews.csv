Horribly spicy masala rice
"I was a frequent visitor here in my college days. A pocket friendly restaurant with simple great food.. don‚Äôt expect a great ambience here as you will be surely blown by the food served here. If you have ever been to baghdadi in colaba and liked the food there you will surely love this.
Must try is their butter chicken with chapatI as they don‚Äôt serve roti, banglorian kabab , hyderbadi chicken, and caramel custard.."

Lovely food. Have been there so many times and may have tried almost all the dishes especially the Mughlai dishes and they all are good. Although this place is quiet popular so you might have to wait during rush hours and weekends.
"Civil is one of my favourite restaurant, where I love to eat mughlai and authentic non-veg dishes. It's one of the best after bagdadi. I ordered chicken Afghani, chicken kolhapuri, chicken mughlai and roti, they also serve chapatis. The dishes taste amazing and they have a very different kind of flavours together which makes me visit this restaurant again and again."
"The Entire Hostel Life near CST of 4 years we ate at this place and never got bored. Even after 5 years when we catch up, no matter how much money we have we still sit at this restaurant. Ambience doesn't matter. The food is quite good and the only place nearby that serves Wheat Chapati. Chicken Tawa, Chicken Roghan Josh, Chicken Pulav, Caramel Custard is among my favourites."
"Located in a corner in CST area . This restuarant doesn't really have the charming looks or would be preferred by people seeing the place. Visited this place with 5 of
My friends .
We had ordered
1. Dabba gosh - 5/5üòç.
2. Chicken biryani
3.custard caramel
Total bill -600-700 Rs.
This is good place to visit if you are looking to eat tasty food and on a budget ."
"I have no pictures of food at this restaurant but
this restaurant has been my go to place whenever I was close to Crawford market. It's been open since a long time and my favorites have been ginger lemon juice and caramel custard.

The food is decently charged and the portion is enough for one.

Must try:
Kheema fry
Dal fry
Ginger Lemon
Caramel custard
All the other dishes are equally nice."
"Entered the restaurant to have some snacks during the late evening hours, ended up with a sumptious late dinner with a plate of Mutton Arabi Biryani. It was delicious, enjoyed every bit of it. A must visit if you're around Crawford, on a budget and craving for Mughlai. You won't regret gobbling biryani at 6pm if you step in, here!"
"Today I went to this restaurant after hearing so much hype about it on social media. It wasn't really crowded even though it was a holiday. After reading the reviews in which many people mentioned about Chicken Afghani being their best seller we decided to try it and thus along with it we had chapati and their special for the day-Chicken dum biryani. Chicken Afghani was pretty okayish and didn't feel fresh. The chicken dum biryani was a huge turn off and tasted pretty bad. Lastly, we tried their caramel custard which was totally worth the money. It was really fresh and delicious. It is also a pocket friendly restaurant. Overall, the food was pretty okay so you can give it a miss but the...read more"
This place serves awesome biryani with the just perfect portion. The caramel custard is heavenly. Must visit if you are in JJ school because their canteen just sucküòõ.
"Nice food, a must have prawns biryani. Good food joint near police commissioner office, and a hangout spot for people from all walks of life."
"If you are near Crawford market and want to have lip smacking non veg food then this is the place you need to visit.

Small old place, shabby interior, not so courteous staff but always bustling with people and serving YUMMMMM food.

Dishes to try

Afghani Chicken which is the best selling dish they have.
Big soft delicious wheat paratha.
Chicken dum biryani which probably is not the best biryani but certainly having all ingredients to make it a decent dish.

Last but the best is CARAMEL CUSTARD. This is the best custard I have ever eaten. Soft, delicious and just melts in your mouth.

I can visit again n again to just have custard at their place."
"Its really close to Crawford market and after loads of shopping we were tempted to eat something sweet and relax and have a cup of tea. Saw this board from outside that they selling fresh caramel custard and that drew us in. We ordered for the worlds most perfect caramel custard. Its simply the best I've ever had, soft, cold and not too sweet. Later ordered for Masala tea. Very well made and enjoyed every sip. I would love to visit this place and eat a meal here. They have daily specials and when we visited the daily special was Mutton Dum Biryani. A simple place, not fancy and done up, but foodies go for the food , right !!!"
"I have been going to this restaurant now for last 10 years. This is a no non-sense place. You go in have your food and leave. But... but... but.. wait... Its the food which matters here. This place serves mostly to the students, office-goers and shoppers in the Crawford market area. For non-veg lovers who want a budget restaurant, this is the best place near Crawford Market. The Chicken Reshmi, Chicken Tawa and Chicken Afghani are great and they taste hasn't changed since the last decade. Biryanis are a perfect combination of rice and chicken, especially Chicken Taloja and Chicken Arbi Biryani. Never leave this place without having their Caramel Custard. It is the best Caramel Custard in...read more"
"A very cheap eatery in the city , few mins walk from CST railway station . Don't expect a fine environment or great service . It's a place one should go only for food .
We ordered Butter Chicken , Afghani Chicken , Dal Fry and all of these were tasty and all of us loved it. The biryani disappointed us . It wasn't a biryani at all . Was just some overcooked heap of rice comprising of an extra oily chicken ( or Boti as they say ) .

The place is very cheap .
Pocket pinch for 2 would be around 400 bucks ."
"This place is located at a walkable distance from CST station opp JJ school of Arts. By looking at the place no one can imagine that it serves pleasant-tasting food at a relatively cheaper rate.

It may not be one of the renowned restaurants in the city but yes once you visit this place, you will definitely come back.

Chicken Taloja, Chicken Tawa, Dal Gosht, Butter Paratha and Caramel custard are a must try. Butter Paratha and Chapati are always served fresh.

Its ambience is more like an Irani cafe i.e decent. The service is really good.

I will recommend this place to all those who crave for tasty food, ambience being ignored."
Amazing hidden gem...pick any item of their menu nd it's bound to be yum. Chicken taloja nd taloja biryani r just too good. Must try nd with a high repeat value.
"One of the hidden gem. pocket friendly, stomach friendly. Exceeding your expectations in all aspects of you are not in to lavish and elite category.. must visit"
Good food! Went here for breakfast & ended up having mutton kheema paav & Anda Bhurji! Quantity of kheema was very less though! But tasty for sure! :) reasonable place... Worth a visit.
"Every food here is tasty, the best is chicken kolhapuri, I loved ginger lemon syrup and caramel pudding regular visitor whenever in Mumbai.."
"Its your pretty ordinary resturant. Nothing special except they mass produce food and serve you very quickly. If you are looking for finesse you won't fibd any. This is a kind of place you finesse to fav food. Not ambience. Not smart ass servers. Come here. Order. Eat. Leave. The food items are priced accordingly. Veg biryani cost you just 80 bucks. The taste is different, a lot different. Here they put the Masala first and then on top of that plain rice. I was confused at first. But later realized what it was. Bottom line. Worth the money."
"Civil restraunt , one of the oldest restaurants of Mumbai located just besides Zaffran near Crawford market with a small yet delicious menu.

Started with
Chicken Moghlai:- A yummy Chicken dish mixed with egg with perfect blend of spices. Recommended.

Chicken Afghani :- Thick gravy with Boneless chicken pieces topped with an Omlette on top. A bit bland in taste though.

Chapati :- As you don't have option of having Nan, Kulcha or Roti with Chicken dishes. The only options available are Roti and Paratha (with or without Butter)

Chicken Taloja Biriyani :- A huge bowl of Biriyani which is different than other Biriyani. Pieces of chicken are dipped in Rawa and fried before they are put...read more"
"Civil Restaurant is amongst the very old restaurant setups in that area around mumbai CST. It's easier to find as it's next to famous zaffran in crawford market.

It's a ver simple restaurant clean to a proper standard.
Serves really good food with varieties, I was the only one who wanted to dine so couldn't make the most of the visit but as per recommendations I ordered for Civil Special Chicken which was in Red thick gravy with 2 boiled eggs cut in 4 pieces as garnish. The grave was beautifully made and flavorful. I ordered one butter paratha which was really soft and followed it by 2 chapatis.

Thier Afghani chicken, butter chicken, chicken rashida and chicken white gravy are...read more"
"This place is a super VFM option. If you are a bit tight on the budget and still want to gorge on some wonderful mughlai food then this place is a must visit. This is a very old place and is packed most of the times.

The ambience is very old world with the high ceiling giving a very old world yet rustic feel to the place. The service is fast and the food is served piping hot.

I tried the civil special chicken and thier famed parathas to go with it. The gravy was the usual tomato onion based with all types of masalas thrown in with boiled eggs on top for garnish. The paratha made of wheat was quite thick but was not hard and was a delight. The chapatis were fresh and soft too.

"It's one of those places you'd visit just for the food. This restaurant serves the best gravies I have ever had. My favorites are the Butter Chicken, Chicken Afghani and the Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Biryani I ordered during my previous visit was disappointing, and is honestly something to avoid. The food is inexpensive. The service is prompt and the service staff are courteous."
"A soul satisfying lunch at one of the oldest restaurant in CST. Wanted to have a simple lunch so went to this simple restaurant.

The specials list had Dal Gosht on the board. Didn't wanted to have it so ordered CHICKEN RASHIDA. This dish comes in with 2 pcs of chicken and med spicy gravy. Its garnished with grated boiled egg which looks like cheese.

There's always a confusion whether to order a roti or Naan or kulcha to accompany your chicken dish. Here, there's no confusion as they only serve hot chapatis which are light in your stomach.

Also ordered one Jeera Rice which is tossed in ghee n cumin seeds. The flavor is mind blowing. Must order."
"Super cheap.! But I liked their food,I visited this place number of times cause of their authentic taste what they mention in their cards.I choose chicken Mughlai from their menu if asked for favourite and even Taloja biryanis are good.Just the thing is they don't provide tandoori rotis.!!

Ambience:2/5
Service:3/5
Food:3/5"
Not a fancy place but the food is extremely delicious.. tried butter chicken and chicken Afghani chicken with butter paratha it was fresh and the preparation was extremely nice.. and ended my meal caramel custard which is a must try at civil.
"Disclaimer Alertüòé
A MUST TRY FOR ALL THE FOODIES OUT THERE IN MUMBAI üòå
So basically I had been to cst side many times but never heard of this place and last year only my brother suggested regarding this place.
So we went out there and after that its been number out of times i had been to this place.
Now coming to the point , CIVIL Serves you one of the best white gravy base boneless chicken ; it is just superbü§óüòã
White boneless chicken gravy is the must try.
Apart from this they serves other chicken dish variety which are also very good.

The place is decent they serve good food .there is huge varieties in veg as well as non veg . Service was okay. One must try chicken patiyala n chicken kadai . Caremal custards was so fluffy Soft n it was yummy.
"Anything can go wrong finding this place- its tagged at a distant locality in fort and I cant even remember the number of times i left my office, trying to look this one up for its famed caramel custard. So to keep things simple - look for crawford market, look for Zaffran - and there you have it - the place next to Zaffran (How sad do I feel about the folks ignored this place while going next door for 'good' mughlai).

Nothing, and I can assure you - NOTHING can go wrong after you enter this place.

Very unassuming, fairly quiet - and not a place to go to on dates(unless your date is as mad about food as you). No maintained, even by its own humble standards - but the food seems be...read more"
"You cannot miss this restaurant if you visit Crawford Market.
I have a Norwegian Cat and a French Maine Coon thus I often go there to buy their goodies ;)

Civil is one of those simple restaurants with great food. The ambience is not good at all but then the food and the pricing compensates for that.

The starters are delicious - Keema Pav, Bheja Fry, Keema Dry, Scrambled Eggs and Chicken Kebab.

The main course gets even better with Mutton Afghani, Dabba Gosht, Mutton Kabuli, Mutton Korma and Prawns Masala. Do try the Rotis since most of the varieties are pretty decent.

They also have the Chicken Club Sandwich and Mutton Chilli Boti which taste DIVINE!

"An extremely cheap, fast serving mughlai specializing caf√© or restaurant (depending on your preference) that's bang for its buck.

Food tastes good, I generally go for mutton, which isn't all that great here. Chicken dishes are well prepared and feel scrumptious.

Its a small dingy place, so don't expect much, enter, order, eat, pay the bill and leave. The place is not as clean as I would have preferred however the value for money trumps all. (No pun intended :D)"
"The food was pretty good and way to cheap. I ordered for a chicken thaloja and paratha. The restaurant is pretty cheap and the best part is the caramel custard ,,it's damn too delicious"
"This place was totally unplanned for, as we had to shop at Crawford and this was the closest place to the car park.There was a long queue before being seated.We asked the accountant if we can place and order until we get some time to be seated, he was so sure that the food will be served in 10 mins after the order is placed. So we waited for few mins the restaurant doesn't have a great ambience.The server took down our order until then we were served with this huge pile of a tissue glass...:)the food was then served one thing is great about this place is that being an Iranian joint the veg and the non veg was uhhhmazing and not forgetting one thing when you end up going to these places do...read more"
Located just beside zaffran near Crawford this restaurant is plain and simple. The food is tasty. Not for people who freak at sight of spicy food. We had ordered chicken taloja and prawns masala. Both were nice. Chicken taloja is more than sufficient for three good eaters and two heavy eaters. Ginger lemon mix was good to have after the food. Price is too cheap. Overall verdict is huge value for money. Foodies go have a bite!!!
"Civil restaurant is located on the way from CST station towards crawford market. Zaffran is located right next to civil restaurant but i had to be here for what i have heard from people and when i entered it looked more like an irani cafe but serves mughlai and north indian food.

The look and ambience is very much like a cafe well lit with as much as 30 people sitting capacity. I had heard a lot of the chicken taloja which is a favourite here for it serves 3 medium foodies. But we were two of us serious hoggers and mind u guys we were full to the brim.

Chicken taloja is basically a mughlai style curry with 6 chicken pieces which have been pre marinated and fried and then later on...read more"

Was here last nyt wid my cousin....... Must try chicken tolaja and caramel custard......lowest price and delicious food......loved it....!!!
"The price you pay for such awesome, sumptuous food is just like charity!

Located very close to the JJ flyover entrance from the VT side, take a left at the junction and locate Zaffran restaurant on your right which is just 2 buildings away.

We were two of us and ordered their signature dish chicken Taloja with prawns fry accompanied with roomali roti. The chicken Taloja is mind blowing with quantity enough to beat a hungry 3. We were just two, and managed to finish the meat but a lot of the gravy was remaining. The taste is very rich, not very spicy but just right. The prawns were simple fried prawns. Just enjoyed the taste as starters. Not to forget the supremely awesome caramel...read more"
"the food is well cooked, not very flavorful but it still is yummy and filling! glad that i went there, the bun maska was such a good part of it. the chicken biryani, so perfectly cooked and was pretty good! the ambience is average and the service is pretty efficient!"
Entered with curiosity but relished the taste. #PrawnsPlainFry #prawnsbiryani were mindblowing. #ChickenTaloja nailed the taste buds. Ultimate #freshlimesoda of my life & perfect #caramelcustard therapy
"Civil is the most favorite.. Very frequent visitor.. For those who wanna have cheap, tasty non-veg must strictly visit this place.. It is little small place but non veg is super.. And the custard caramel over here is to die for.. They have the best custard caramel.. And the best part is very cheap and amazing.. You can find my half clg students here ( havingüçÆ) :-D"
Amazing taste....should visit the place.....and d caramel custard is too goodüòç...right besides zaffran that place is a treat to ur taste buds..
"Amazing dabba ghoshtand parathas...biryani was okay..have had better....
Zomato map gives wrong location..beware...had to walk extra 2 kms from that location"
"Only visited this place as zaffran was closed. But so glad we did. The tawa paratha was amazing. Slightly greasy , wonderfully flaky, this made a terrific accompaniment to the brain masala that we had ordered. Another standout dish was the dabba ghosth, a splendidly creamy mutton and egg concoction that went well with both paratha and Biryani.
Finished this with some ginger lemon juice and a lightly sweetened and exquisite caramel custard. A fantastic experience where we last expected one.
Finally full marks to their patience when my little daughter couldn't hold on to a full bladder and let go in the restaurant. They were very understanding about it, when they needn't have been.

"Omg civil resto...we were at nariman point and on the map we saw its only 20min by walk so we decided to go by walk..and we were walk-in and walking but there was no site of this resto...then finally at CST station we took a cab and reached the resto..
The funny part is the parking in front of the place..the cars are so closely parked that it's very hard to find a path to go to the restaurant...
Anyways why an I boring u guys
Now coming to the review
Awesome place guys
Food and taste is 5/5

"I give this restaurant a visit whenever i come to cst with my friends. My favourite here is butter chicken and chapatis, and a nice caramel custard at the end, which is a must have if you visit Civil. You dont have to burn a hole in your pocket to get your tummy full. If you are hungry and running low on you budget, check in here and enjoy the tasty food over here."
"This place is heaven for non veg lovers , its got exactly wat v want ,CHEAP ,TASTY & VARIETIES are plenty , caramel custard is somewhat most popular dessert ."
"The ambience may not be good but... It really doesn't matter.. The food here is soo good that you'll forget everything.. Chicken taloja was very good.. Not to mention, the famous caremel custard... Just the best"
"It's worth every penny you pay! We went there for lunch at 3.30pm and still we had to wait . The mess like ambience is not good , but the tasty food provided overpoweres all the cons. Chicken Taloja is excellent as well as the Chicken Rashida. Biryani was not good instead I suggest to order Dal Tadka or Dal gosht and Jeera Rice. The Caramel Custard is too good.. It just melts in your mouth!"
"Yes this place in crawford market i will never forget, We friends visited this place to eat keema pav when we were in college, very pocket friendly and ordinary place, but the waiters here give you good service, butter chicken, arbi biryani are great, and don't forget to taste thier famous caramel custard it is the best of all, let this place be as it is we have left our memories here, keep going"
Craving for a custard ..pop into this restro and have this amazing melting custard.. other items r good too.but custard is a must visit for
Our usual lunch spot on most of days must try is their taloja biryani other than that chicken afghani is also good and caramel custard moderate pricing decent menu
"Pocket friendly place for non veg. It looks like any other average/ below average place. Not really fancy. It is not for ambiance or lighting. This is the place for just having food. Well the food is good. I like tawa chicken and afghani too. But to the health freaks, they put a lot of oil in every dish. So I don't think this is an ideal place for you.
It is situated on the busy street near crawford, hence no harm stopping by for a meal when you are in a rush. Very ordinary kind of place to eat with decent service."
"This place doesn't need introduction but still I will sum it up with

""A simple restaurant with simple ambience serving the best and tasty food at affordable prices""

If you are at CST for a meeting or shopping please drop here.

They serve both veg/non-veg

Highlights:

Butter Chicken

I work at Times of india opposite CST station. This place is near my work.always crowded. I have never tried anything at this place.....EXCEPT ONE thing.....Caramel Custard..... I'm big fan of their caramel custard....they create magic....the custard just melts in your mouth. For just 35 bucks per cup.....I can eat their custard all day. 4.5 rating only for the custard
"Parked outside Zaffran i noticed a small pic of caramel custard on a barely noticeable wall with Civil restaurant painted on the wall. Waiting for my friends who were shopping at Crawford market, something inside me made me lock the car and walk over to civil and ask for a caramel custard parcel so I cud sit in my car and eat it. This rating of 5 is for the best caramel custard I'v ever eaten. I was blown away by the taste never in all the places I'v eaten in Mumbai have I found a better caramel custard. I'm waiting for the next opportunity to go back and eat it again...will also try their food and write abt it.

"Civil Restaurant or Civil Canteen as some patrons call this place can only be described as a well oiled machine. I am very choosy of my words in a review, and the reason i called Civil  a machine is its one of the only places that churns out food with such great consistency that it can only be achieved by a machine.

The food is tasty ... absolutely no doubt about it at all, and you can look at every review below and it will describe each beautiful flavor one can relish here; what I want to mention is the consistency of this truly memorable flavor that the restaurant serve you.

"Civil is a run of the mill kind of eatery located near crawford market next to PK wines. I have frequented this place quite often for lunch as its walking distance from where I work. This place is know for its Moghlai & Chinese food. The look and feel of this eatery is closer to a Irani joint. But let me tell you the food served here is really delicious.

The must try items on the menu are as follows:
1. Chicken Afghani
2. Butter Chicken
3. Chicken Civil Special
4. Mutton Moghlai
5. Dabba Gosht

"I came across this place while I was at Crawford market for some wholesale shopping. I am glad I was hungry and decided to check out this place. Ordered for a mutton plate and roti. My hunger was satiated but my heart was not. I wanted to have more, that's the brilliance of the food here. Whenever I have good food, I smile. And this place made me grin. I hope I have said it all :-)"
"This place has a run down Irani Cafe kind of feel to it, but the food is great. Tried their Chole Boti and Dabba Gosht. Both were very good. The pricing is very very modest. Will be back again whenever I am in this part of town."
"A haven for carnivores like me! I have tried out every mutton and chicken dish in the menu, and I must say they are all lip-smacking, finger-lickingly superb. After the meal, you can't leave without having the caramel custard - THE BEST caramel custard you can find. (Take my word, I went around scouring all over Fort and Colaba to see if there was any caramel custard that could beat this one, and I did not find any.)

Not much to talk about the ambiance - it can easily go unnoticed, what with the imposing Zaffran next to it. However, do walk in, and prepare to melt into the delectable victuals."
"It is located near Crawford market, good for non-veg lovers. All the menu items are priced very modestly, simple restaurant, for everday eating. Its chicken afghani and chicken biryani is worth a try, and it will dent a hole in your pocket, nothing much or more to try in this restaurant."
"Good food at economical price.
Value for money.
For mutton lovers must try Mutton Pulao."
One of the best place to for the non vegetarians. Value for the food cheap and the taste is amazing.Must try Chicken Afghani and Paani kam Chai.
Value for money and awesome food.
Must visit for the caramel custard they serve. The best in Mumbai. Food is tasty and cheap. This is a small restaurant nearby the zaffran. Went there by recommendation and wasn't disappointed.
