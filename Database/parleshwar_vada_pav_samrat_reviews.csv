"late on service ,triple fried in deep low quality oil , too too oily , not fresh at all"
The taste was awesome 😋 loved it. I have officially moved from Vidarbha Vada paav to Parmeshwar Vada paav
Vada Pav lover will defiantly have to visit this place for authentic vada Pav taste. The vada Pav is yummy and spicy. Chinese bhaji is crispy and yummy.
"Very yum vada pav with green chutney and red powder, yum being the key. It’s good amount of spicy. Can add one salted green chilly for the burning effect."
"When we are thinking about the Mumbai... The food we think first comes is the Vada pav , samosa pav , pav bhaji and many more.. It is like this food to people here that how much you eat here is less and you want to grab it more and more..

We were regular visitors at Parleshwar Vadapav during college days. They are very famous in Vile Parle. Love the vadapav and Chinese bhaji pav with shezwan chutney. They serve it along with spicy & yummy dry chutney 😄
Parleshwar vadapav is perfect place for vadapav lovers😍. The taste of shezwan vadapav is awesome. luv from mumbaifoodiejai♥️
You can taste the perfect moong bhaji here which is uncommon served with lip smacking chutneys

Tried these bhajis which were crispy and nice.Its amazing.
Parleshwar vada pav is famous all over mumbai and everyone knows about them.It is pocket friendly to eat and tasty and they have many different other varities too
There is something different in the Vadapav that they make and the the taste that is there very tempting. The food is being praised by friends and the crowd there is great 👍 the packing and service is also great. Had a nice time.
"Vadapav is emotion of Mumbaikars. Since my childhood I am big fan of vada pav and I tried it at many outlets. During my college days I used to go there and since then parleshwar vada pav is one of my favorite. This outlet is in vile parle east near station road. Favorite place for many peoples.

They have a vast menu for vada pav from normal vada pav to cheese burst vada pav everything is just awesome. I personally like butter vada pav, cheese burst vada pav. Cheese burst is best selling item so cheesy with some mayonnaise. Their chatnis are also tasty. Must try vada pav in Mumbai. 👍"

My experience with this store was beyond perfect. Not only was the staff extremely kind and helpful but also super efficient and effective. I'm from Lucknow and bought 30 vada pavs to take away. they packed everything so nicely. I would totally recommend this place.
"Based on recommendations from online platforms and hearsay, went here hoping to be WOWed.
But all I felt was meh. The vada was cold, the pav was chewy, the chutneys were not spectacular, and the overall taste was below average.
Why do people go to such places and continue to make them popular?
I can think of at least three vada pav places that operate from a hand cart and are delicious!
Well, what can I say? Don't go based on random reviews online and words of appreciation based on hearsay. It's not worth a visit at all.
The big bad foodie was angry!"
"⬛ parleshwar vada pav

It is the one of the famous place for vada pav
The taste of the vada pav is amazing😋
And the price is also reasonable
They have variety of vada pav
And many more
The staff is also polite and friendly 😊
I visit here many time
Must go and try here
Must try Chess grill vada pav
Visit here...."
The vada pav is really tasty. It's a light snack and the slight spiciness of the vada makes it worth having.

Well .I had the most amazing vadapav her.. their cheese burst vadapav is to die for. I ended up licking my fingers all over for dripping liquid cheese.
"This is famous outlet in Vile Parle ,Nehru Road
It was awesome place

Whenever i feel hungry i go there

They serve variety of vada pav , samosa , misal, kanda bhajiya, and kothimbir vadi ,corn pattice and refreshment drinks and many more ...

Service-- quick (5/5)
Food-- tasty 😘😘😘"
This is the most famous vadapav outlet in vileparle since years now! Their vadapav has a distinct flavour you'd not find in any other ordinary vadapav! Must try for schezwan cheese vadapav. If only they try for outdoor seating it would be a plus point for them!
"Mumbai food ""Vada Pav""known for its taste here at Parleshwar Samrat Vada Pav you find the taste.Try Butter Vada Pav that is very tastly. This outlet is always crowded for tasty vada pav they serve."
"The Parle East outlet is very good. However, west outlet service is hopeless. The seem disinterested. We ordered for cheese burst vada pav after seeing a video promo. The vada was good. But onions were missing. When we asked the person at the counter, he kept ignoring us and our questions. Why pay 45 rupees for it if it’s not as per the ingredients!"
"Another vada pav eatery located on Nehru Road which is always brimming with college students and hence a lot of fast food eateries.
The vadas were sumptuous and the chutneys were tasty especially the sweet & powder chutney. Overall decent experience.
They also serve a variety of chats and other fast foods.
No dine in, just pick up and on the go."
"Who doesn’t love vada pav?
Samrat is most amazing place to try the lifeline of Mumbaikars, the hottest quick bite, vadapav.
They also serve a variety of vada pavs like cheese vada pav, schezwan vadapav and also grilled Vada pav !
Overall rating 3/5"
"Looking for maharastrian food? you should definately go to parleshwar vada pav samrat.A decent and tiny food corner.The lifeline of mumbai-Vada Pav you get here are so delicious and yummy that you can't satisfy by only one.They also serve samosa,missal pav,kotmir vadi,chinese bhaji."
This place is cheap. Good for refreshments. I really liked missal pao and cheese vada pao of this place. Only Chinese bhaji was below average.
Vada pav is the lifeline of mumbai and this is one of the best place to have some best and known atreet food of Mumbai. They have variety of vada pav and they also serves missal.
"One of the best place to have JUNK food is near Hanuman Road Opp. to Parleshwar Mandir.

💡 CHEESE BURST VADA PAV : ( Jain )

What the price is charged for this product is not up to the mark but surely some great combination and good use of cheese along side of raw bananas to make the vada.. And then technique of keeping the cheese in the middle so it is melted even after 2 hours is really great. One must have dish i feel

"When on moves or comes to the city of Mumbai, all one crave for are the Vada Pavs, Misal and the pav bhajis. So as I asked my friends around for good Vada pav, I was told of a very famous Vada pav stall in Vile Parle, one of the oldest and most famous Vada pavs ever !!!
So wanting to try them, I found the place on the busy Nehru Street Junction near to the Vile Parle Station, the road that leads to the Weatern Express Highway & the airport. It’s impossible to miss this and it’s been there since the 1940s. The place is called Parleshwar Vada Pav Samrat & rightly so makes a mean Vada Pav. Very tasty and up there on the top for Vada pavs indeed !! Perfect combination and mix of the...read more"

"Authentic Maharashtrian snacks you will get hear. The Vadapaav is just Awesome fantastic. Must visit if you are in Vile Parle. This place is always crowded.
Keep up the good work."
It’s few minutes walk from station. Recently renovated and looks pretty good for a street food outlet. The taste of vada pav is average. Do try their kothimbir vadi and if you are up for experimentation then try their grilled vada pavs Nd Chinese bhajis. Overall a nice place for having quick bites.

"Craving for the Typical Mumbai Ka Vadapav in the Heavy Rains , Then this place in Vile Parle East is the perfect place to Eat Vadapav in these Monsoons..
The vada ,with tasty filling And thick and cispy covering majes the Vadapav Experience better and
the Chutney balances out the flavours pretty well."
"I am a regular costomer to this outlet. Their Vada pav's, Punjabi Samosas and Patti samosas are a must have. It's totally worth your money. They always serve piping hot Vadas and you are never left disappointed at any point in time."
"Samrat❤️
Famous for its marathi cuisine. Recently renewated and now has excellent ambience. The staff is really friendly. Service was quick.
Bhaji paav vada paav are the ones you must definitely must try. Also the chinese bhaji paav tastes Amazing.
The best thing here was the misal❤️ loved it."
"Won't be visiting again.
For a street fast food menu, ambience is good. Vada pav was not great in taste and was overly spicy ( not needed when you add spicy chutneys). There is nothing special about these vadapavs, the ones sold on the street are likewise."
"This place was renovated few months ago and they have created a good ambience for a fast food outlet . From the looks of it the place is under the new management but the fact is they have just worked on creating a good ambience and forgotten the fact that the food they serve is what gets people coming in.

This place under previous management served all the items fresh and hot. Whenever we went ,no matter what time of the day, they served the vada pavs, samosa and all the other items hot .This was one of my favourite places for having vada pav.

The other day when we visited this place , we were told that vada pav would take time as the bhaji has not yet arrived . We ended up having...read more"
This place is located 2mins away from vile parle station. I found Chinese bhajji to be my personal favorite. Spicier vada pavs and bhajji pavs were my favorites.
Well as they name suggest famous for its vada pav... Bhajjyas.. Chinese bhajiya with schewan sause... Have tried many times... Its tasty... But don't expect anything close to Mithibai college - anand stall.. They don't put butter to one's liking n also pav are small... But taste wise its decent... For me Anand Stall is undisputed King!!

They also have a different types of vada pav ,schezwan,grilled etc. Also do try their Misal Paav"

They have coupon system which allows the customers to have food in a systematic way and they do not have a place to sit but have kept roundtables for their customers to have their food!!
The Food and service has some sought of difference with another branch of vada pav Samrat which is situated on the Subhash Road.

Located near by station. Always crowded with customers. You have to try schezwan vada pav and chinese bhaji from this outlet. It is a must try for all vada pav eaters
Had seen this outlet growing over the years but with a consistent taste. Many options from the Maharashtrian Snack menu to try here. A bit spicy so be cautious.
The taste is consistent how it was when it started years back. Yes a but spicy even without any addons in it. Recommending to have atleast 2 different products on your first visit.
"There is this Vada Pav joint that won't disappoint you at all.
What an amazing delight it was to go and have the variety of Vada Pav they serve. Seriously I was amazed.
We had the grilled version of the Vada pav tht is priced around 35rs but definitely one Vada pav and you will be full...!!
We had the schezwan mayonnaise grilled Vada pav.
This was so good that I literally parcelled one for my better half Nish Chowta .
We also had kokum sherbat. It's perfectly made and tastes just simply amazing... Wil surely go and review their other variety soon.

"Have read about Parleshwar Vada Pav a lot on the internet & hence we could not stop ourselves from trying their famous Vada Pav, Bhajia Pav & Schezwan Bhaji.

Vada Pav here is a must try as they are yummy & we thought are one of the best vada pavs we have ever eaten in Mumbai.

A plate full of delicious hot onion & schezwan pakoras is mood changer at any given point of time. Do not miss them for sure.

Being in the business of selling tasty vada pavs for more than 32 years, Parleshwar Vada Pav counts on our list as one of the best Vada Pav serving joints in Mumbai.

Quick service, happy staff for your service.

Happy Meal!

Serves good vada pav and dozens of other snacks at reasonable prices. If you're lucky you can get freshly made vadas. Hygiene is a little bad.

"Big no for dadar west outlet I can't find in zomato so I pass information here
I went in dadar outlet with a lot hope but it was really upside down for me
In outlet they r serving vada pav without chutney (chutney is there but u need microscope for that) and when I ask for chutney guy is giving me tissue I don't know for what
And taste wise it's a real no from me thair is no taste at all u really need to look in to this
Before they have jumbo king and that vada pav was really nice
Parleshwar management really need to look in dadar outlet I taste ville parle one that was owsome"
I tried their vada pav for the first time and it was fabulous. The garlic powder and green chilly tasted awesome between the vada and pav u should definitely try this place if you are in Mumbai.
"Vada Pav is in the heart of every Mumbaikar and Vada Pav Samrat does 100% justice to it. From being just a small corner near the station, it is now in the heart of Parlekars. They've added so many varieties to a simple vada pav and it tastes heaven. A must visit for all Mumbaikars."
The best vada pao and samosa joint in Vileparle. They have no seating available here. The place is always crowded. You should definitely try their Chinese bhaji and samosa.
"Really liked the vada pav here..size was big, gud quality and reasonable at Rs.15....
Much better that mithibai wada pav which I feel is overrated.....
Will try their missal next time...."
Being a big foodie made me try vadapav of this & trust me you'll never regret eating here. I've even tried punjabi samosa as well as batata bhaji which are delicious too. They serve many varieties of vadapav so if you wanna try than you should & am sure you'll never regret.
"As a mumbaikar vadapav is my first choice for quick bites. It is famous vadapav center just outside of parle station. It's always crowded but service is too fast. They served hot hot vadapav. Other than vadapav they also served samosa, Frankie, bhajias, misal Pav, lassi and Chaas.
They have variety in vadapav grilled, butter, cheese and schezwan etc. Vadapav size is big , pocket friendly place. Vadapav lover must visit."
"Parleshwar Vadapav Samrat is the most popular vadapav centre in Parla. (And that's something, considering that Parla is the hub for foodies) They have now expanded to Dadar too.

Other than the Vadapav, they offer snacks like Bhaji Pav, Samosa, Kothimbir Wadi, different types of bhaji, etc. They've also started Frankie corner and Usal-Misal dishes.

On my last visit, I fancied their staple Vada Pav. Luckily for me, they were just finishing a fresh batch. So, I got to savour the garma-garam vada. Their chutneys are just right. You can ask them to add or subtract them as per your whims. :P

Vadapav with lassi..Can't beat it... Value for money... Hygiene ...Portion ...Always thumbs up...👍"
"Absolute lip smacking vada pao. I have seen this place grow from a small thela to a hole in a wall makeshift place to the existing place.

The place is a must visit for vada pao lovers..The chutneys are one of the major factor in making this place this popular. The vadas are huge and always freshly fried and hence piping hot. The place has a fairly decent waiting place. They stuff bhajiyas and other fried stuff too."
I must have eaten from this place so many number of times and it is one of my favourites. I just love their vada pav and no other restaurant can replace it. Their bhajis are amazing too and I always buy them when I m hungry. They have a lot of variety in bhaji and my favorite is the onion bhaji. Their kothimbir vadi n samosa is awesome too. It being near the station is the best and this place is always crowded. I can never get bored of tasting their food.
"Am not sure about food quality my review is only about service ..
They are very RUDE specially the guy in the pic attached..
They were behaving like they were doing a favour on people by giving /serving them their own order.
No matter how good quality food you give if you don't have respect for customers coming in to your place sorry then your place is not for us."
"A decent place to have some of Mumbai's specialty items like vadapav, bhajiya, samosa and chineae pakodas. Located near parle station and sathaye college its a good place for people to have fastfood on their way."
"One of the best vada pavs I have ever had
Whenever I go here they are always piping hot , and yummy
They also have other varieties such as
Patti sombosas and schezwan bhajjiyas .

This is the place if you are around parle east .
You can't afford to miss this place .

"Had heard about this place. So here I am reviewing it.
""Samrat"" in its name truly justifies it. One of the places in mumbai were you can find the authentic taste of Maharashtra. Had ordered #GrilledVadapav. It was served with sorte carrots which added more flavour.

Advice to outlet : seating arrangement is required to some extent. Bring up more varieties of maharashtran cuisine. (Like adding misal pav etc. To menu)
