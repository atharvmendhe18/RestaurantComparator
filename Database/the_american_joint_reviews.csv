Review
The American joint in BKC is a casual restaurant in the popular Capital building. It is a blend of the Indian & American culture serving traditionally American food with a desi twist

Best burgers
I went here to catch up with an old friend. Great value for the price. Good food. The only bummer is that there is a lot of rush at the place generally.
"Best place to hangout and the food is just delicious, must try pasta paneer makhani taste is just superb the presentation and food both is awesome.."

"The perfect blend of classic American plates inspired with characteristic Indian flavors, truly proves to be not only wholesome but delicious too.

They really live upto their motto of ....REAL TASTE. REAL FOOD. Loved the great Indo-Western food made out of localized, fresh Organic fruits, vegetables & dairy products . The menu which is a perfect balance of Modern American Cuisine & original Indian flavours is a culinary delight giving a delicious treat to our taste buds with ""REAL TASTE"" & "" REAL FOOD"" which is natural, free of artificial chemicals & 100% Vegetarian.

The ambiance is amazing , service is good & I truly recommend this...read more"
"Had been to American Joint second time today. Had a good time there and food was also good. We had ordered ""Something for everybody "" from their new menu and I must say that the sauce was really yummy. For dessert , we chose to have double decker brownie delight. The waffles were fresh and crisp; however the ice cream started melting before the dosh was served to us because of which the presentation of the dish was ruined. Would recommend this place to all the foodies and a suggestion to the team at american joint ""please reduce the waiting time between the dishes served. Although we passed our time solving puzzles provided to us as paper mat.""☺️

And before I end...read more"
If U Have A Sweet Tooth And U Are Around BKC Do Visit American Joint And Try Their Oreo Shake U Can Also Enjoy The Amazing Ambience And The Staff Are Very Friendly
Best place for Jain food .....all the Jain people who enjoy good food should visit here. ... The quantity is much bigger than the other restaurants.....this place is also good for Jain people as they serve Jain fries too.....overall amazing place
"A cozy small place with limited sitting arrangements. But the ambience was good with all vibrant green. Crowded at peak office hours. A delight for the jains- as it is a pure vegetarian restaurant. Couldn't try many dishes. But for the ones which we tried were good.
Starting with, Frypenos- A paradise for cheeselovers! Will truly love it.
Nachos-was served in good quantity but taste was not upto the mark.
Mac n cheese tikka - was something new to try. Basically it was mac n cheese pasta with the tikka gravy.
Chimichagas- bean and cheese stuffed deep fried burrito accompanied with salsa sauce, sour cream and queso sauce for dipping. Was too good and yummm.
The food was good. Just as per...read more"
It's a purely vegetarian joint. A small place with limited seating arrangement. The food is strictly average. The food could be made tastier. Request the management to just think about it.
It’s a pure vegetarian restaurant and the menu option is very restricted being a lunch joint they do not have healthy options .The food taste is good however the menu is restricted. The staff is courteous and service is quick .
"Good food, decent size portion.. so full value for money.. but the only drawback is the small place with less staff. So when i had gone on a Sunday it was quite full and the staff took a long time to bring the food..."
"Was my daily lunch halt most days. The hummus is gold standard in my humble opinion, and you can't go wrong with their Watermelon feta salad.

Expect the classics in an honest and simple setting, you'll enjoy the place. It is all veg.

Unfortunately they don't accept Zomato gold on 2 items for a solo table, so I now lunch elsewhere.

Highly recommended though."
"Its the worst restaurant i have visited in 50 years of my life
No taste very small menu
Pls close down the joint otherwise pls improve your menu and food item"
"It’s a very small place with around seven to eight tables. I came here because of their menu and was very excited to try their food.
However, I was very disappointed. The only good thing about this place is it’s fast service.
We ordered:
Mac N Tikka(3/5)
It was Mac and cheese with a little tikka gravy.I was very excited to try this but the taste just wasn’t good.

Frypenos (5/5)
This was the best dish that we ordered. It is served with ranch sauce and ketchup.
The cheese will melt in your mouth. Loved it!

House Organic Veggie Burger(4/5)
This veggie burger was a delight but was served with fries with no salt!

"I am a regular visitor of this outlet and love hammus and pita bread. However today I am writing this review specifically for the service. I was served with dead hard pita bread which was difficult to chew and won't go along with the hammus served. I brought it to the notice of the waiter and he said will get it changed. However after waiting for a long time nobody turned up with new pita bread. Frustrated waiting, i decided to pay the bill and leave rather than keeping hope of getting a new pita bread. I asked for the bill and nobody cared to give me a fresh pita bread, instead presented the bill. When had a word with manager he simply said don't pay the bill rather than apologising.

"Food has deteriorated, half of the menu not available. Not worth now. Worst service. Not worth money even after zomato gold discount. Will not recommend anymore"
"Located at the 1st floor of The Capital, BKC. The American Joint known for it's fusion food, is an amazing place for the people who prefer pure vegetarian food.
.
.
.

The duo tried -
Mac n Tikka :- Tikka Masala Mac ‘n’ Cheese when added with a little Bombaya tadka makes it spicy, creamy, cheesy and deliciously crave-able.

Cheesy fries :- Liquid cheese on top to make sure it ain't just fries.

The place is really small but comfortable & has green interiors. The services are abit slow but the staffs services & smile makes up for it❤️"
"Food was not good specially Mac n tikka.
Service was very slow, long waiting time
Card machine not working.
Will never recommend to go to this place..No varieties in food also.."
"Mere average food! BKC has a lot more better places to discover for food.
Staff is good and the food is prepared quick, but the taste and quality isn’t amazing!
Wouldn’t suggest this place and will rate it only 2.5/5"
"To begin with the Food is just Horrible. We ordered 6 dishes combining jain which is nachos, chole, salad, fusion pasta, hummus with pita. None was upto the mark. The Decor and ambience isnt overwhelming at all. I dont think they have any organic food at all. The chefs weren't properly dressed neither their heads were covered the were pathetic on hygiene. The manager is also very rude. I personally wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. I visited with my full family of 6. We ordered all kinds of dishes. Mexican, indian, Fusion, Italian. None were even decent enough to consume except for Indian which was just ok. The branch has discontinued many items from their menu. The staff is rude and impolite. Ambiance Sucks. Cant find a single reason to recommend... Attrocious experience."
"Staff behaviour- 3/5
Food Quality- 3.5/5
Ambience- 4/5
Must try-
Mountain O Nachos and Mac n Tikka

The portion of the food served was pretty good but taste could’ve been better. The atmosphere was quite excellent. Worth a visit!"
The food here is really okay. We had been here on Sunday evening. It was quite empty. We had ordered for soup and nachos. Both of them were okay. The nachos did not taste that great.
"A small decent place in the center of BKC with limited options on menu. Service was nice with attentive staff. Food was not upto the mark and found nothing american about it. The Falafalized burger we ordered, the bread didn't seem to be too fresh and was bit coarse. Cheesy fries were also not to great in taste. The Shakes were reasonably ok.

All in all needs improvement in the food with respect to taste and quality!"
Amazing place with very tasty food but the quantity is not adequate so only four stars out of five stars. Jain food is available so its a big plus point.
"The American Joint is located in BKC.They serve fries,burgers,nachos,pancakes and many more.It is pure vegetrain food chain.It is busy during office hours as it located in BKC.Here we tried Cheesy Fries which was yunmy.Then there was an dish called try some feta with your watermelon which was tossed with an tangy feta.Then we had Frypenos which was like cheeseballs.It was so cheesy that it melted in mouth and it was served in an Ketchup & Ranch Sauce.Then we had Empire State Pizza which was average.Mac n Tikka was awsome it had an Mumbai ka Masala & Macaroni with spicy tikka gravy.In Desert we had Brownie Waffle with Nutella which Chocaltely.Overall it is excellent place to hang out with...read more"
"One of the worst experience ever. Had ordered initially hummus pita, watermelon feta salad and tomato basil soup. The soup was served last and the soup was sweet. Hummus was v sour. Watermelon feta salad was ok. Den we ordered chimichanga and the burrito had no salt and salsa dip was pathetic. Would never again visit the joint again"
"I love this place and had visited there several times as it is just opposite to my work place. The ambience is good, staff is friendly and service is super fast. I have tried almost everything on their menu but I love there cheesy nachos & Mac cheese pasta. Although both dishes if ordered together become too heavy as both are overloaded with cheese. Please try thick shakes there, amazing taste. Pick any of your choice."
"This place serve delicious food.
I had been there a couple of times.
Pastas, and fries are great, they also have Jain options available,
Ambience is quiet nice.
The best dish is the kikat waffle, it's so goood."
Kids loved it if you are cheese lovers this place is heaven their nachos and French fries are must try if want to gain few kilos quickly then go for it 😁
"Small, little outlet in the capital building with average ambience but LIP SMACKING food.
We tried
1) Cheesy fries : 4/5
2)Mac & Tikka : 3.5/5
3) Brownie waffles( Nutella) : 5/5 This one truly stole my heart. One of the best waffles ever had.MUST TRY!!
The staff was friendly.
This place is surely value for money with Zomato Gold."
"I went to this place for lunch today and ordered two dishes
1.Mac & tikka
2.chilli fries
Both dishes were very ordinary,it didn't taste good.
Would not recommend this place for food.
One good thing about the place was very fast service.
Else nothing good about this place."
"Located at the first floor of The Capital, BKC the American Joint is an amazing place for those people who prefer Pure Vegetarian food. The place is a bit cramped and can't hold a lot of people. Overall the ambience was good.

My review of the food I tried:

Veggidilla : ⭐ ⭐/5
San Francisco Garlic Fries : ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐/5
Mac and Tikka : ⭐ ⭐ ⭐/5
Mountain O Nachos : ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ /5

If you plan to visit this place, I would recommend San Francisco Garlic Fries and Mountain O Nachls"
"This place is know for its fusion food.

In pic: Empire Estate pizza from The American Joint. The auntentic manhattan pizza with loads of Mozzarella and marinara sauce.

Had booked on zomato gold but in the restaurant app wasnt working so was not able to use them and had to pay for full amt. Plus the food was not that good apart from nachos. A single person serving and had to wait for your chance for ordering. Wouldnt recommend.
THE FOOD WAS AVG... SOME THINGS GOOD SOME THING OKISH... THE SERVICE WAS GOOD... THE FOOD WAS WELL SERVED..BUT FOR FOOD TASTE YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE GOOD ONES FROM OPTIONS AVAILABLE... BETTER TO ASK THEM FOR GOOD ONES
"Visited for the second time,and still impressed!
Ordered the paneer melt sandwich,and I have to admit Never had a sandwich so juicy and tasty. And loaded nachos are my all time favorite ,it's so filling and yummy! Plus you can enjoy zomato on food!"
"Excellent food with perfect blend of taste, presentation and quality. Ordered cheesy fries and pesto pasta. Both dishes were too good.only complain is regarding quantity. Price wise quantity were less. Otherwise full marks."
"Ambience: 3 ⭐️
Service: 4 ⭐️
Taste: 3 ⭐️
Value for money: 3.5 ⭐️
What I tried:
1. Mountain O Nachos: crispy nachos with melted cheese, olives, jalapeño and beans. The tortilla chips had a nice thin texture and the melted cheese was super creamy. 👍🏻
2. Hummus to you: Warm hummus with garlic with soft and buttery pita bread. Loved it.
3. Garlic bomb cheese bread: garlic bread rolls loaded with melted cheese. The garlic bread was a little bland.
4. Mac n ticca: a masaledar twist to the classic mac and cheese. The mac n cheese standalone was good but it doesn't quite work with the ticca gravy."
"American Joint!
Visited it alot of times and tried several Jain dishes. It is priced well and also served in good quantities. 4/5 for sophistication.
The ambience is not very impressive, tiny little place. Quite busy during lunch hours.
It is located in the Capital, BKC.

First, my all time favorite dishes here which are 5/5 are:
1. Frypenos - The cheese is going to melt in your mouth. You would love it!

2. Yummosas - 6 samosas are served, 2 each of 3 different types and with yummy sauce and chutney. Paneer filling, raw banana filing and the cheese filling. It's for sure a samosa treat for Jains!

3. Queso Emergency - Nice dip with chips to just munch on. American Joint serves the exact...read more"
If you are veg/jain and want to try mexican or burgers..must visit this place...good variety..even deserts and shakes are good...just one thing dint like was inspite of mentioning $theClassicCelebration event on zomato..they denied to give us that offer mentioning they dont have information about it...just 3 outlets so this much coordination and management you should possess
"Food: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service:3/5

Ordered all Jain food. Food was highly ok. It was more like a snack time place then dinner place.

Had dish named-
1) 'Try some feta with your watermelon
Feta was hardly there in thin layers. The seasoning was over done. It completely killed the flavour of little feta and watermelon.
2) Banana chips were good. Stood out from rest of the food.
3) Nacho- chips were good but cheese sauce was not upto the mark.

Was scary when they had a knife stuck in a burger so that we can cut it and we had 4 kids around us. Would have become very dangerous."
"The ambience is really good and the food is very very different.
What I loved here was the fusion of Mac and cheese with Makhani. It's delish!"
"It’s an organic cuisine pure vegetarian food joint located across a city with 3 franchise. Their menu is a mixture of American Cuisine & raw Indian flavours. It’s a tiny place with limited sitting, a reservation during the weekends is suggested.

Bhaji Fries
Very few food joints have a variety of Jain fries. This place is definitely out of one which carter to Jain foodies. We tried fries drenched in spicy bhaji, topped with cheese. The quantity is more than enough for 3 people. The gravy was delicious, and fries were cooked perfectly. Only after some time, it will start getting soggy.

Mac n Tikka
As the menu is a mixture of two countries, we decided to go with the theme. We ordered...read more"
"I heard about this restaurant but never been there, but recently i visited this restaurant and got amazing experience. The staff of the restaurant was very polite and kind. We ordered jain food. Service was fast and food was awesome. We orederd thali, burger, pizza, burritos and juice. Taste was good and food was hot. Burritos had very tangy flavours and pizza was so cheesy. We will surely visit this restaurant again and also recommend others😊."
"What a food joint...wow..
Burger is awesome..and can't forget to state about jumbo nachos.. simply yummy

Best part was a complimentary desert offered by the restaurant owner..he was very good to us..

Just need a larger place as the restaurant sitting area is just enough for 20-25 PPL that's it..thus always waiting period to get in"
"This outlet of The American Joint is located on 1st floor in The Capital,BKC
The outlet is very small with only a few tables to accomodate guests, the ambience is fair!!!
The logo says a much about the outlet- The American Joint written in a font that the Indian Scriptures, the menu absolutely accords!!!
They have tried to give the american dishes an Indian Touch and have given justice to a lott of dishes in their Menu!
We ordered Garlic Paneer Burger, Mac and Tikka, Mountain O Nachos,Bombay Fries,Frypenos
Every dish was cheesy and had a twist to it!
Commencing with the starters
Mountain O Nachos were tooooo cheesy and the veggies used ranged from olives and jalepenos to spring onions and...read more"
"It is located in one of the bestest area of bkc Capital, that's the most happening area
The ambiance is not that appealing, was a bit crowded as the place is bit small
Staff and Service was pretty good
If you are Jain and looks for some again food then this is the right place for you as this is the only place in bkc for perfect Jain food as they provide vegan as well

So we had ordered:

Veggidilla: It is perfectly mentioned in the description stuffed with vegetables and cheese with amazing cream (RECOMMEND)🤩

Mountain o nachos: This was super drooling and yummylicious, got finished with the minutes it was submitted 😋 (MUST HAVE⚠️⚠️⚠️)

Ambience is quite small yet nice. Service is very fast. We ordered nachos and paneer burger. Nachos were really good and cheesy and enough quantity for two people. Paneer burger was very heavy and paneer was very very soft. Good place to take a break while working in BKC.
"It’s a place in bkc, bandra near Starbucks. It’s know for their healthy food and I can’t deny that. They have vegan food as well in the menu. I ordered French fries which were good. They had a flavour of Chinese sauce in it. Then, I ordered hummus which came with pita bread which was very delicious and healthy. I also had chilli cheese burger which was made of wheat bun but the taste was ok. But if you are a burger lover you should try their house organic veggie burger it’s just mouth watering. The presentation was also good. I also tried mountain o nachos and they are amazing. They are healthy and tasty. The service is also quick. The ambience is very normal.

Browniewaffle-4/5
Lemonade-3/5 ( lil costly)
also i had Zomato gold so it was a good deal anyways!!!"
"Contrary to its name , its an indowestern joint. We had falafel unwrapped and southwest cobb salad. The taste was okay. It is a good place for cheese lovers."
"Want to get something out of the normal snacks then you must atleast visit once here.
I have ordered Hongkong fries (5/5) and also Mountain nachos and also the pasta here is very tasty.
Also the hygiene is maintain and fast service will be given."
"The food is not at all good , I had gone with the review but it's so not worth at all . I won't suggest people with good food taste to go here"
"An amazingly amazed place is this. The food served here is very hygienic and organic. Tried Pasta and Fries both were amazing. Ambience was very good.
Staff was very friendly and services were quick.
Waffles were very soft.

Food 4/5
Ambience 4/5
Staff 4/5"
Very slow service and rude staff it takes ages to get something back on table and at times they forget what we order i see only a single waiter always serving all in all not that great place. The food was ok not too bad not too good and not worth the price for sure.
"Small joint! Not a very fancy place.. we ordered the corn bisque soup, watermelon feta salad and chalupas.. all 3 tasted pretty decent.. ambience was also ok. Worth a visit for sure"
"Well I rated 4 because I’m more of a meat lover and this place is vegetarian only. But it really has amazing variety of fusion dishes which surprised me. Its an Indo American Fusion food joint. It’s all veg but organic and tastes yummyyyyyyy.
Must try :
1) Double decker brownie waffle
2) Mountain o nachos ( I loved this a lot because I’m a nacho lover and it was very cheesy)
3) Jangli O Jangli fries (4 different types of fries)
4) Their organic veg burger
5) Kitkat Shake
A cool place to have a kitty party or chill out with you friends."
"First time when I had been there more than a year back , that time it was awesome. The food was fresh and good
But when I went there recently I got disappointed, the veggies were almost dead and lost it’s freshness and even the nachos were okish compared to the year back quality..
Overall their quality is going down.
Also if you come across kitty party or ladies group please come back later as the noise in the room gets too loud and you can’t enjoy your food (happened twice)"
Decent place good food. Surprisingly Chilli Cheese burger had no cheese and the patty was a real bummer. Garlic paneer burger would be my suggestion. Fries served alongside burgers are too good. Don't miss out on Mac n Tikka pasta served with tikka gravy. Oh that savoury goodness tastes heaven.
Taste of the food is not up to the mark...so is the ambience...not a happy experience...staff was courteous...but apart from that everything else was below average
"Best place to enjoy tummy filling veg food made with utmost hygiene and quality product. The place is a small 6-8 seater QSR kind of place however, it has a good menu and the quantity of food is just amazing. We were six people and just 4 starters and main course did it for us. The cheesy fries are great, so is the corn bisque soup.

I would definitely come back here."
"While the food is wholesome and good, the joint has to work on basic cleanliness. Mosquitoes and small flies were a nuisance accompanying the food. We ordered the paneer garlic burger, tikka fries and open falafel. The burger was flavourful and the fries were fresh and the tikka gravy was generously loaded on to them. The falafel fritters were a little too dry for my liking. The ambience is pretty average and not very alluring."
"A place where you should go only when you want to ensure you want to have a very bad meal... The only thing you can expect here is badddd service .. The person attending is definitely not interested in service. The person was just not bothered to attend to customers.

Few things to note.. Served water in a already filled bottle which was partially empty from an earlier table.. When informed that this won't work and that he needs to give fresh water.. He took the bottle away and didn't serve water at all.

Asked for a fresh plate... Got the plate only after couple of reminders

The vegetable organic burger has only bread pattice and mustard in it. And tastes horrible. Asked the waiter to...read more"
Love their Mac n tikka...all shakes are yummy...they have a good menu that satiated my junk cravings..loaded fries are another good thing.. on the downside service was slow and waiter was impolite!!
"We were extremely intrigued to hear an Indian twist to an Italian favourite, The Mac n Tikka. We weren’t very fond of the makhani gravy but the mac n cheese tasted decent.
To end the meal, we binged on a Nutella Waffle served with whipped cream. Pocket friendly cafe, a fairly good experience overall.

Service - 3.5
Ambience - 2.5
Taste - 3.5
Value for Money - 3.5"
One of the best place for Jain items and I would recommend them to add few more Jain items and they should expand the place and they serve food in good quantity they should keep doing that
"The American Joint is a quick and hassle free experience. It is complete value for money with Zomato Gold. It's vegetarian, please note. As it is located in my office building I have visited the restaurant on many occasions. There are about 9-10 tables and an open kitchen.

Food wise

1. Hummus and pita : hummus was quite good. The pita was more like paratha, tasted fine but wasn't exactly pita. 3.5/5

2. Frypenos : this was a cream cheese and jalapeños cutlet with 2 mayo based and southwest sauces. 6 pieces in a serving 3.5/5

3. Veggie burger : a mash up of sauces, tasted average. Special mention for the fries - excellent fries 3/5

4. Chole rice bowl : strictly okay, slightly bland...read more"
"So this place is at BKC...its a small restaurant but good service..we ordered mac N cheese which taste like paneer tikka , so it was ok..we ordered hummus you which was yummy as pita bread was also thin crust, we ordered nachos which was also good & colourful, we ordered spaghetti which was nice & spicy, we ordered basil pasta which had natural taste of basil leaves but there should be have more gravy..they should work on dish presentation !
Ambiance is good!
I would give 3.5 star!"
"Long pending visit to this place.
We had already decided what we wanted to have.

1. Mountain of nachos
2. Garlic Bread Bomb

And the verdict- There is something like too much cheese.
The nachos could have some more salsa in it. The bread could have less tomato sauce."
"Mountain nachos, watermelon lime spritzer and chole rice that's it. The place has decent ambience, however lacks in service. Expensive and not upto the price you pay for."
"Very unprofessional and extremely rude staff.
Ordered everything pure jain - still my burger comes with onion slices - small and quite messy kitchen at this place.
While placing order 10:15 on was givving zomato gold to the waiter but he insisted to unlock the same at the time of billing, at 11:05 we were unable to do so as the app shows restaurant closed at 11pm. To this the waiter says I don’t know the rules and I cannot do anything..
When my father asked to speak to the higher management waiter very rudely back answered.
2 months back also I had come here with reservations made via zomato app. As the restaurant was full the waiter denied having any reservation at all.

"We were 4 friends who visited the American Express BKC joint on Saturday. The restaurant had put up a board of discount depending on the number of guests. We were happy to see that. While we were having our dessert, the server got the bill. We paid the bill. Just yo confirm, we asked them if they have taken the discount that they have mentioned. To our surprise, they said that we should have asked for it. They got the bill without us even finishing the dessert. Secondly, this was something they had put up on the restaurant. Why would the customer need to ask for it. Extremely rude staff."
We visited this place after visiting The Lil Flea Market. A small Organic Cafe. They stuck to it and were truly Organic. The pasta was made out of wheat. The nachos were Wheat chips too. Also there was generous amount of cheese in each and every dish we ordered. Also everything that we ordered was Jain and honestly couldn’t have got better Jain food anywhere else in Bombay. An amazing cafe and definitely a must visit for Jain eaters.
"Very bad Experience
No good food . Zomato Gold is not on Milkshakes .
The staff is very unprofessional and service is also not good . Not worth . Would never visit next time"
"Located in Capital, this is a small restaurant having a capacity of 35-40.

As my friend is Jain, the food options were excellent. However, I found the food to be decent reason being the food was a little cold.

We ordered the mountain nachos, chilli fries and pasta.

The nachos was really good however the pasta was horrible and the fries were average.

We tried cheesey loaded fries and samosa
The quantity was good! Sufficient enough for 3 people and the taste was lipsmacking
Worth every penny
The only thing that i didn't like was service which was not prompt
The place is small and can accomodate around 20-25 people

"Location - At the heart of BKC, this is in the Capital building right opposite the ICICI Bank Towers

Food - This place serves almost everything in Jain, and the quantity is fantastic. The food consists of starters but the food is lipsmacking good. It has a lot of fusion food options available and mixes all Italian cuisines with Indian ones to give it that perfect taste

Service/Ambience - This place is small and has a capacity of approx 40 people but it is very well lit. The service is quite prompt and good and you would hardly complain against it. A perfect place to catch your lunch in case of a time bound lunch break

"Have visited this place a few times in the last few months for lunch primarily. 

It is a small place in one of the prime building in BKC, the Capital. They have an open kitchen and that kind of screws up the whole experience. The place is always smoky, smelly and hot - very high chances that your clothes will be smelling of food by the time you finish. Since they have smoke/smell issue, the building management will not allow them to keep the doors open and that will worsen the situation even more. 

I have tried multiple things - burger, sandwich, nachos, etc, but to be frank, I never enjoyed their food much. I end up going there most of the times when the other places in the building...read more"
