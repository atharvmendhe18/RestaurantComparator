Review
"My husband order food at office, food was awesome as I like seafood. 
Ordered Bombil Fry, Javla Vada ( a new thing which I liked), Prawns, Sol Kadi, GAjar Halwa.
Out of all I liked Javla Vada and Bombil fry. If you like seafood, then you may checkout this place."
"A must try for all sea food lovers. The place looks ordinary but the food is good. The staff is really nice and helps through their menu.
They have many offers which adds to the fun.
Everythg that v ate from vada to fish to rice; everythg was good.
Give it a try during ur lunch break or when u have come shopping in Phoenix."
"Really different taste almost similar to authentic aagri food, but slightly changed to cater to the mumbai public. very decent set up. Parking is a issue so is the wash room, I mean these things are very basic these days, specially with women and children around. The taste the service everything was great."
"This place was a real find!! Excellent food outstanding service and the ability to create appetite.. What else does one look for in an eatery like this

Aagri food is not to be confused with malwani food and chef Vikrant Patil keeps the distinction alive

The aagri prawns curry is absolutely to die for.. Spicy tangy and keeping the prawns as the heroes of the dish... Chef Patil knows his prawns.. Indescribable!!

Pl do visit... They do full surmai servings and are loaded with other options

I am so thrilled with myself! Unfortunately no photos to upload.. There seldom are when the food is so good and is being wolfed down greedily!!"
"Recommended by a colleague, ordered quite a lot of dishes from two three variety of fish to prawns. The food was not exciting but the quantity was decent. They also gave us chicken cutlet on house. The delivery was pretty much on time and packaging was good too. I guess its operated by Wok Hei as the delivery boy and the bill receipt clearly gave that sign. Overall i do feel they can work on the food as its not worth the amount they charging and also i am pretty sure one will not feel its worth ordering again."
"Good service recovery.After a terrible experience last time, they come back with wonderful service recovery plan, They are very much concerned about there customers satisfaction,And the best part is the Co-Owner Mr. Hari Kotian has personally looked after on the previous comments regarding food and ensuring even better service  And today i felt he kept his promise ""Delightful good food"""
"Very unhappy with the services...While we ordered food over the phone the charges said and came in the bill was totally different....Not expected such services..Prawns pulav was tasteless not served with gravy...Prawns were uncleaned... after so many recommendations on zomato, our expectations were all in vein...sol kadhi was really very sad...
Highly not recommended....."
This place gives you an authentic experience right from the water to the food. The water is served in clay pots and the food is excellent. It is a must visit for any non vegetarian who loves traditional Maharashtrian food.
Good food Good ambiance Good service and Fantastic taste ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Wow Hotel Chosen By My Wife. This Is 2nd time n more yummylicious tasty prawns, bombil n surmai was served. Prawns are simply superb. Manager Mr. Vikrant is decent n very friendly. Surely try once."
"The place is bang opposite phoenix mills. Decided to give it a try after reading about it. Service is average with the guy taking order has no understanding of aagri or maharastrian cuisine for that matter.

We had chicken thali and chicken sukha. Too spicy as expected but tasted below average. I guess the emphasis is on making it spicy and not tasty.

It's easy on pocket. One can try the seafood over here."
"AAGRI CHI HAGRI SERVICE.

We reached the hotel at 1.20 in the afternoon and were waiting till 2.30 just to get a seat. We were told 15- 20 minutes, but it took us too long. The Staff is too slow, especially the guy who takes the order forgets half the things.

No water was server until asked.

The food ordered was nowhere close to Aagri preparation.

The Soul kadhi we ordered for was very sad, I almost forgot how it tastes after having this. Depressing.

The surmai thali we ordered had some other fish. We were 6 of them and we were really disappointed with the food. One of us did not get the order till the end and when we got it... the waiter brought the wrong order.

this will probably...read more"
"Aagri cuisine and lots of disappointments.

Serving staff is the Big disappointment. They Never understand orders well or forget what was ordered. They don't know their own menu very well.

All in all TOTAL disappointment in taste, quantity and quality. AC was not working,They had put a table fan.Waiting time told by the manager was 15 mins we waited for bloody 1 hr as we wanted to try it. No water was server until asked."
"Aagri Culture Express?? what culture? food culture? i have not tasted it but for sure it is not Aagri cuisine and lots of disappointments.

1) Serving staff is the same as WOK HEI. Big disappointment. Never understands orders well or forget what was ordered.

2) Rs195 for mutton thali. All i got was one rice bhakri (That too 4-5 hrs stale) which was tough to break. One bowl of rice. one bowl of mutton curry with 5 pieces of mutton of which 1 was eatable rest were just bones, and the taste was also not at all great. No spicy, less salt. accompanied with half small piece of onion quarter of a lemon (Only 3 drops came out when squeezed). I had to asked for extra curry for rice, and i...read more"
"Needs work. Just came back from a not-so-memorable lunch (with my team whom I convinced to try this place).

Read about Aagri Culture Express in today's (6th Nov) HT Cafe and checked reviews on Zomato, While I appreciate the attempt to showcase the niche Aagri cuisine, lot could be improved out here.

We were the first ones to get here for lunch. The place is small, can fit about 7-8 table (for 4). Nice to see bottle made of clay, so far the only traditional experience. There was lot of confusion while taking our orders though. Sol-kadi was said to be unavailable, but later they came back and said they do have it. We ordered for a soft drink, and we got 2 fizzless glasses of cola. They...read more"
Yummy food! Amazing place that serves food that's spice and tastes like home made food! Hardly any oil used. And the taste is out of the world! Def worth a visit when you in this area!!
"I n my friend checked in at Aagri culture express, food was good but it was too spicy i know aagri food is spicy but still, we had surmai thali and bombay duck, fish was fresh. 500 for two worth it. Wont recommend to weak heart peopleðŸ˜œðŸ˜Š."
"Well, recommended by a friend so we decide and head towards our destination. Small place, little crampy in terms of seating area. So our order was: Surmai Fry, Prawns Fry, Chicken Thali, Mutton Thali, Prawns Thali, Rice Flour Puri and Mutton Gravy and in the thali was Prawn Fritters Chutney. Aagri is supose to be Spicy but all the dishes lacked flavors and taste. I could only taste Red Chilli.
Well, Surmai Fry was okay still had flavors infused.
Mutton in thali was tender but the extra one we called for was too chewy. It lacked tenderness.
Prawn Fritters Chutney was made out of dried prawns so the taste could be little off side.

"Sunday Mid Day of October 11, had an article about Aagri cuisine coming to SoBo. Some of our friends had travelled all the way to Yeoor Hills in Thane to taste and relish this cuisine but I had to give it a miss. The article just mentioned the vicinity of Lower Parel and no definite addresses or contact number. Got to call a few people and could find out the exact location. This place now takes over where the Wok Hei restaurant was previously. Called the place and was informed that the last order was at 10.30 pm. Reached well in time to place the order.
