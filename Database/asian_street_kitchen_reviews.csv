The food was good I ordered a triple schezwan rice but I hope that the restaurant will start using eco friendly containers to deliver food and that was a thing I didnâ€™t like because plastic is plastic in the end and which causes cancer
""
the taste was bad. needs a lot of improvement
Manchurian was old and stale.
way too little noodle for a ramen.
""
yesterday's food they served non sense.. very bad restaurant
The food packaging had no zomato tape or anything.. it was just a plastic box ðŸ˜” what if the delivery person adds something in it ? who is responsible for that ?? very very very bad packaging
Always serves well. Maintains quality and flavors each time we order.
The gravy tasted tangy

I order triple shezwan fried rise and you take me noodles
The food arrived late and no cutlery was provided.

nothing special and quantity is less. honey chilli dip was good though.
"Had manchow soup, paneer chilli bao, khow suey - all of which was really really yummy. Although it's a simple restaurant in ambience, the food is extremely good. Must try!!"
Was yelling on me and showing smartness
They didnâ€™t send rice

Great Taste

The containern in which have delivered the food is in a low quality class plastic container as against the amount charged. poorly packed. this was supposed to one single bowl order per person. they have sent separate rice & gravy making it tedious to serve and more use of Office cutlery. was expecting in a nice eating bowl as shown in the picture.

Crystal Dumpling It was very good
taste and quality was very bad
"Tried their set buffet the service was ok attitude of staff was pathetic, they dont know how to speak"
"never expected this quality from asian street kitchen. have always ordered before the same dishes with same instructions but this time it was really bad.

deapite saying less salt, the tom kha soup had lot of salt.

the spring rolls were chewy, raw and not fried properly as if we needed to complete the frying process.

the basil noodles were okay.

will now think twice before ordering again.....i wonder if they send this quality of food when ordered from zomato or even if we order directly from the restaurant?

highly disappointed this time."

"Had ala carte dishes one evening and was pulled in for the lunch buffet soon after. The taste, the authenticity, the service, the staff, the hospitality, the buffet spread, the price point ... the list is long and the reasons are too many to keep coming to this place. I would not rate this place any lesser than a 5/5."
The buffet at 625 Inc of taxes is just amazing.....everything was soooooooooo yummy....sp the Burmese salad....water chestnut salad....fiery paneer....hot n sour soup....crispy Lotus stem.....were just out of this world ....and then came Thai curry n rice with noodles and mix veggies in hot sauce.....omg.....we were stuffed....and Kadir got us everything on our table and we thoroughly enjoyed this place.....highly recommend this one
"really really bad gravy, bad dry noodles, very very oily rice"
"The food tastes good. However, Manchurian balls in the gravy are very few.. 4 pieces.."
"Located on the beautiful side of the city opposite Chowpatty is this pretty Asian restaurant that serves pure Veg and Jain food.

They have a buffet option available with very similar and limited options. We chose to order from their menu and ordered Crispy Corn and Water Chestnut for the appetizer and Penang Laksa from their ASK bowls that were flavorsome with quantity enough for two. We especially loved their Penang Laksa which balanced the coconut flavor and was served with exotic veggies.

The service is sharp but a little less pleasant, and the calm vibes make it a peaceful spot for family or business meetings.

nasi goreng in jain was really good. they could have added more tofu. I could hardly find 2-3 rough scrambles of tofu in entire big bowl. Plus one peanut pink sauce quantity was really less in quantity.
