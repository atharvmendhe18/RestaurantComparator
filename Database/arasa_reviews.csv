Very good food
good quantity and packaging
fast delivery order recieved before 12 mins
Wrong items received & neither the restaurant nor the delivery person is taking responsibility. I will NEVER order from this restaurant ever again
"Dal tadka was delicious, it was hot and tasty."
Misal usually comes with pav. Restaurant doesn‚Äôt give the pav with it and don‚Äôt provide separate option to order the pav.
the original taste of Arasa is no more there

"I Have Been Eating Food in this Hotel , Since My Childhood . The Food Is Good,Price is nice And Food Service is Also nice ."
"Arasa
Its located just a minute away from andheri east station.
The restaurant is divided into Ac and non ac section where the ground floor is non ac and the floor upstairs is Ac.
So coming to the food. It's a pure veg restaurant.
The food tastes good. Everything is well cooked with no issues. The prices are reasonable.
I had ordered once and the oil had spilled out over just to keep that in mind or else over all the food tastes good."

My childhoods favourite restaurant this restaurant I used to visit In my childhood very often but now I rarely visit there l remember that the food was very tasty and yummy üòã
"Arasa an other veg food restaurant cited in the bylanes of andheri has pretty interiors upstairs with good staff.

I've been a customer since 4 years and the sad part is as the years are passing by they are loosing their quality and taste.

The prices are really not worth paying for the food served !

The ambience is super relaxing no doubt but food really disappointed us partially .

Well the pav bhaji and other few dishes were made to perfection but they were charged too much !

Overall a good place , it's a hit or miss type"
This is a good South Indian restaurant. You can visit here with your family and friends. The utthappa that they serve here are really good .
"This place is near the railway station. This restaurant is for pure vegetarian. It has decent ambiance and great place for the meeting and stuff. Quantity is not good enough. But it does have good taste. The staff is quite good. If you're really hungry then you can visit this place.
Overall- 3.5/5"
"Good food, Plain and simple.

Ordered some Rava dosa, dal khichdi and sabudana wada.
Quick bite before catching the metro.

Service was quick too."
"Nice taste .....

Good Ambience....
Friendly Staff......

Near to metro station...
Good place to eat when you are in hurry....
Ac and non Ac both available....
Nice experience....."
"A nice place to visit for breakfast or lunch for a nice Indian cuisine. A place that has been here for many years. I have visited this place many times in the past and whenever I had any work in andheri this is the place that I would come for my meal. This place has some decent south Indian options, from their masala dosas to their wada sambars. Their food is quite simple and attracts a lot of working people in the afternoons, mostly packed during breakfast and lunch. A place you could visit to have a decent and simple food with company.

Ambience 2/5
Food 3/5
Service 3/5
Recommended 3/5"
"Arasa is located exactly on the corner of the court lane. The food was no doubt good but didn't really like the service.

We had ordered :
1. Cheese Sada Dosa- It was a bit tangy. The batter didn't seem to be fresh.
Rating-2/5

2. Veg Crispy- It was nice.
Rating-3/5

3.Cheese Biryani- It had sufficient amount of cheese cubes and the quantity was good but the taste was pretty average.
Rating-3/5

4.Paneer Kolhapuri with Butter Roti- The sabzi was nice and the roti was soft.
Rating-3/5

However, the manager here is crazy, extremely arrogant, very disrespectful, doesn't know how to treat his customers properly and keeps on screaming and shouting on the staff for no reason infront of all the...read more"
Worst experience. Highly rude staff. Denied most of the things we asked. Pathetic. Needs instant improvement. Place is nice to be. But the staff has bad attitude
Food was good ..but still need to improve... Service is too slow .. staff is so confused... Called for Jain food but they made a mistake .. they were just into one big group they ignored other .it spoiled my mood .it was a mess .please improve .waiter takes the order not captain .there was no rush but still it was no proper .big no for this place .spoiled Saturday.
"A very nice place for having food specially for commuters because its just besides the busiest Andheri station! Quite good for south Indian dishes, breakfast and some fast food. Quite busy during the afternoon i.e Lunch time, so the food service is a bit delay! Need to wait for some time for the food to be placed on u table!

Food is tasty! South Indian dishes are really nice and some of the pav bhaaji things which one would love to have it!

Misal paav is one recommended dish along with some punjabi dishes and paneer biryani!

All and all just a fine place to fill your tummy and have a nice food!

"Sorry for Low ratings. Its good only for Snacks item, and rest for all they put lots of Soda in food, extremely horrible to eat such kind of dishes with huge Soda in it. you will feel stomach full with in few bites. they need to stop such practice. other wise not worth"
"Giving a try to new place sometimes put you in a situation where you don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúsamane wale ne kab apki leli‚Äù the only reason of we trying this place as we got sick of going to same place everytime so we decided to try something new and since somebody suggested us that go for mysore masala dosa specially, we ordered it on priority.
The movement we take our first bite we feel we were in Gujarat as it was sweet. Then we suggested the staff that boss this is sweet and not a mysore masala dosa over which he tried to convince us that bhaiya ji ‚Äúhumare yaha roz chef change hota h toh har chef apne hisab se banata hain toh aj ka mysoore masala dosa toh yeh hi hai...‚Äù....read more"

Nice place. Located near station on the east side. Food is very tasty. Not too expensive. Ac room is better than the normal sittings. Parking not available. On the road itself. Will be seen easily.
"Been here quite a number of times, I really like the place! It is hygienic with a casual ambiance, & superb service. Portion of food could easily be divided between 2 people (unless you're a foodie) then of course I'd recommend getting one dish per person. #Tastyfoodinlesstime"

"Arasa is a restaurant which is located near Andheri station on the east side besides the Andheri Court. The menu here is widely spread which consists of North Indian, South Indian and street food. The ambiance is also very good. The staff here is also very helpful.

Things i tried-
1) Rava Masala Dosa
2) Onion Uttapa
3) Mysore Masala Dosa
All the dishs were very delicious and even the coconut chutney and Sambhar served along were also very delicious.

This is a must visit restaurant with friends and family to try out some mouthwatering food."

"Located on the main road near Andheri station, right below metro station. This outlet has been year since many years. South Indian food is a must try from this place, specially the medu vada and idli..even paper dosa are amazing. A highly rated place to eat south Indian food"
"The food is decent. This restaurant has been here for a long time. Ratings would have been better if the cashier was kinder. He makes a fuss at people who give him a 2000 note which is kinda funny since I suppose you would have change while running the hotel the entire day. Also not like he didn't have change, he had a bucket full of smaller notes."
"Those tasty days of Arsa are dead now never ever suggest to go now when many excellent options are available around Arsa.
They are so much over acting and over co fident that they don't care what we cuatomers like and what we want to enjoy our meal.
Too much insulting and worst experince from a restuarant where we use to enjoy a lot during our school days."
Visited this place today and we were not disappointed.. Located very nearby to andheri station it is a decent place. Ordered Paneer Tawa Pulav which was delcious. The staff is also good and service is fast. Decent place to visit
Located in busy area near andheri station. Ample place to sit. Food is tasty. Try dahi wada here. I usually visit for south Indian food. But you can get a decent cup of tea or coffee.
"Average place. Located right beneath the Andheri metro station. I don't know if it's just me, but the A/C section food always seems to taste better than the non-a/c one. Service is decent, food is more or less worth the prices."
"I visited dis place wit cousins,
staff over here was friendly ..
Service was slow...
I ordered :-
Naam, Tandoori roti, panner kolapuri, veg Hundi,
Triple swchzn rice and veg crispy and veg swchzn fried rice!!!!
Tandoori Roti - was soft and nice
Naan - was also good and tasty
Panner kolapuri - was OK OK in taste
Veg crispy - was oily and also salted
Veg Hundi - was nice with less oil in it
Triple swchzn rice - it was good and Manchurian balls wore little tasteless in dat gravy
Normal veg swchzn rice - it was tasty and v asked for swchzn sauce it was Awsum.."
Just a normal lunch restaurant the ac section is better than the non ac taste is just average. Service is not good overall below average üò∂üò∂
"This place has been around for years now, remember coming here as a kid.

This place is well renovated now and has an AC section on the first floor where you can sit comfortably and enjoy your food. The food is amazing and delicious. No doubt, their quality has not decreased one bit!

They have a huge issue of mosquitoes though, so ensure that you have completely covered your legs or else the swamp of mosquitoes will kill you with at least 20-30 bites."
Good food. Service is good. Overpriced and ambience is sweet. There is a minor parking issue there so avoid big vehicles or think of parking before you enter here.Harsh Patel
"February 2017

'Don't judge a book by its cover' is apt for Arasa. I went here on the insistence of another foodie friend & was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered for rasaam, hara bhara kebabs, paneer chilly, daal makhani and rotis.
Rasaam was good. Hara bhara kebabs were a little salty for my taste but otherwise no issues with them. The mint & chillies chutney accompanying it was refreshing & lip smacking :)
I didn't have the paneer chilly. However my friends quite liked it.
The daal makhani was the show stealer. It was brilliantly made. Absolutely loved it!

Portions are sufficient. A value for money place considering we spent Rs.600 for the entire meal.

"One of the oldest restaurants near Andheri station and still standing strong.
This is one of the places to which Zomato rating doesn't matter because of its old school nature.
Divided into AC and Non Ac sections and this restaurant is pure veg which is a disappointment to the Nonveg lovers.
But this places serves you the awesome south Indian cuisine, right from idli to uttappa and filter coffee, you name it and it will be there.
But for an Udipi restaurant I enjoyed their ""Chole Bhature"" as well which was quite surprising.
Coming to the service it might take little while for your order to arrive but yet you will find this place busy and crowded during peak times.

Very old restaurant...south Indian food is too good ... It is usually for common people... Ambience is bad typical chai stall type but southindian is too good ... I ordered veg crispy it was with brinjals can't believe thisüòëüòëüòë pathetic ... Ac upper floors has very dim light so overall only for southindian
"Located close to Andheri metro and Andheri East railway station, Arasa is a well known place amongst the locals for serving South Indian, North Indian and fast food at a reasonable price. Exteriors are good and is visible even at a distance!

There are 3 tables outside and many tables inside. Ambience is just fine. Got the chance to see their kitchen from inside and it will clean and hygeinic. Ordered Rava Sada Dosa. Order took a while to arrive.

Served with chutney and sambhar, Dosa was crisp but it lacked salt according to my liking. Chutney was the highlight. Thick coconut chutney along with crisp dosa nothing more to ask. Sambhar was on the sweeter side. Service is fine, no Issues....read more"
"Arasa or Arsa whatever you name it, it's your personal choice. The quick snacks in South Indian section are amazing. If you're alone, you may have to share your table with another person during peak hours. Service & Management at its best"
"I never imagined my quick bite would be so amazing !

Arasa is located pretty close to Andheri stn near the court ! It's always crowded for quick bites it's like a meeting hub for all lawyers lol

I happened to visit & tried Medu vada sambar! Was speechless with taste was so yummy yum almost like melting idli sambar was awesome.

I have heard its main course is also fab & its pocket friendly for dinners. In the end it's pure veg !"
People go here because the food is decent and it is convenient because it is located close to the metro and railway station. I think it could be much better. Their name is big but their standards are too low.
