"This is one of the amazing place in Vile Parle. I went to this place as it was recommended by many. The ambience was pretty calm and comfortable. Staff members were too good. What I ordered-
1. Cheese fondue- it was lip-smacking😍 cheese fondue with exotic vegetables and bread crumbs which was an amazing thing to have with soo much cheese.
2. Wild mushroom risotto- I actually don't like having risotto but having this was extremely fruitful. No complaints at all!!!
3. Pimento creme cheesed spinach rise. Spinach and cheese was a great combination altogether. It was delicious.
4. Butter roti and paneer butter masala- I'm a huge paneer lover so yes it obvious me having paneer butter...read more"

We went for lunch just before lockdown... The food is good as well as ambience and interiors... Non veg food is delicious.... I have seen people appreciating the quality of service here but we on other hand had not so good experience with regards to service... We werent suggested nor attended enthusiastically... If that wasnt case i would had rated 4 of 5... Maybe next time they will surely change my thoughts with regards to service...😊
"Visited this place with few of my friends to celebrate birthday. Since most of us prefer North Indian cuisine, so headed to this place as heard lots of positive reviews about this place. Indeed what we heard was worth every penny. The restaurant maintain good hygiene standards. Service is cordial and prompt. The food is delicious. Whatever we tried was delicious. Loved most of the cuisines we ordered."

We are regular and this is not what we get served regularly. Ridiculous food.

Such a bad experience while ordering this restaurant
They should know the basis of delivery then send the food
We trust the food and have from restaurant"
It was Saturday and there were no fish items available.The food was very ordinary and not at all comparable with the price. The price was pretty high for such sub standard quality of food. Not at all worth and surely not going to visit again.
"Went with friends for a get together.

Ambience

It is a small restaurant, with a tv projector showing sport matches/ highlights. On the whole there are no qualms with the seating. On the whole the ambience does not give a fine dining vibe at all.

Service

Given that this is categorised under fine dining with a moderately high pricing the service was poor. They took time in filling water, when asked to be served in bowls we were told that they didn't have enough bowls in a rude fashion.
The managers did salvage the situation, however the damage was done.
