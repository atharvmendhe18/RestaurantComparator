chicken wrap was half cooked
""
The food was stale and the chicken pieces were not even marinated. It seemed like left over food that was topped up with chicken breast pieces. Completely disappointed.
Look at the quantity

"The pasta from my order was a mixed bag. The packaging was decent and the taste was good, but the portion size left something to be desired."
It was not fresh tasted a week old so bad â€¦.. also I could see it was literally microwaved it rather than being grilled

Chicken was tough and dry. Too chewy

I have paid for cheese slice also. And the restaurant didnâ€™t add cheese slice
simple and tasty...also less greasy...reasonably priced for the quantity they serve

"That Biryani was the worst Iâ€™ve had in my life. Weird tasting and a total waste of money. Rest everything is awesome at this place, just stay away from biryanis."
Chicken biryani was delicious but far far tooooooo spicy for my palate

The salad was decent. The wings would have been better if made crispy and the sauce could use a little more sweetness.
