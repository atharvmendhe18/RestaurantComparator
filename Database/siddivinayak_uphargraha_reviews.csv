"Siddhivinayak
Location: Kalanagar near Mhada office

This place is known for authentic Marathi breakfast and yummiest snacks of Maharashtrian. Located in Kalanagar near Mhada office and place is full always. I have born and brought up in Mumbai with Marathi people and love each their cuisine. Be it breakfast, lunch or snacks. You should try this place. 
You will get Usal Pav, Misal Pav, Poham Sabudana Khichadi/ Wada, Wada pav, etc.

Went today evening for lite snacks ordered misal it was tasty also told the waiter to get kothimbir vadi but he did not listen only problem of this place is behavior of there waiters the always walk away when you're are giving order to them most of the time they will sit at the last bench and keep on chitchating we have to always wave hands or call them loudly if wee need anything extra other than that food is tasty and fresh served will definitely recommend this place for snacks
This is an awesome joint in Bandra East.If you want traditional Maharashtrian fare ..then this is the place to go..the Zhunka and bhakri are one of my favourite dishes.The bhakri is ohhhh so sofftt and the Zhunka is charmingly spicy. And ofcourse the omnipresent Mumbai cha Vada pav is a must try..
"Siddivinayak Uphargraha is a simple non-fussy restaurant which serves some basic Maharashtrian food items.

It's located in Government Colony, opposite MIG Club, Bandra East.

Their menu is limited but has a majority of snack items & some meal time dishes like Chapati-Bhaji, Bhakri etc.

Misal - A nice mixture of pulses, with some farsan & a medium spicy gravy over it. It had a lovely flavour & I enjoyed having it.

Batata Wada - Crispy & flavourful, served with a nice coconut chutney.

Thaalipeeth - Deep fried & served with coconut chutney. I don't like deep fried Thaaipeeth & Dahi was missing on the plate.

Alu Wadi - Colacassia leaves layered with a spice infused batter, steamed & then...read more"
"On a recent trip to Bombay, Ullu was craving for some yummy misal pav and this one hit the right note. Had it with some ambyacha panha. Whatte combination while the weather god plays so cool üòâ"
A simple restaurant with great food taste. Loved the kanda bhajji with great tea. The place is opposite mig club. Also the misal was simply awesome. They also have variety of maharashtrin food items.
Good place to get some Maharashtrian food. I sat with a friend in a booth and a stranger joined us. It has a very typical masculine crowd. I have never seen a girl there it as of now. The puran poli is a good. I also like the missal. Informal seating is not my kind of place.
"While overall the quality of food served is quite good, there have been a few occasions when the coconut chutney served with the vada or amboli is stale with a pungent taste...it surely should not be the case. Secondly, the Amboli served also has a sour taste implying that the dough is not properly fermented. Hope that care is taken in future to avoid such instances. Hence this time around I am awarding a rating of 3"
"Places serving AUTHENTIC Maharashtrian cuisines are very rare to find. This is one of them & I'm glad to have found it. We ordered a whole bunch of food items as we were damn hungry. And practically everything here was crafted to perfection. Accurate taste, lightning fast service, decent ambience, a hygienic place of preparation and last but not the least - excellent quality raw materials used for cooking are some of the salient features of this place. I didn't get even a slightest acidicity after having so many fried items!

Here's the breakdown of my review:
1. Aluwadi (5/5 - good big sized pieces and sumptuous quantity).
2. Upwas Thalipith (5/5 - perfect combination of hard n spongy at...read more"
Simple place with limited breakfast and fasting items... The food is tasty and simple... I like going here... The service is also super quick
Wanted to do some time pass for 30 minutes . So dropped into this Bandra East restaurant. It's simple sitting . What most attracted me was menu of fasting /‡§´‡§º‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä/‡§â‡§™‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏ food. I decided to experiment with two unheard ( to me) fasting food item. ‡§´‡§º‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ä & ‡§´‡§º‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä pizza. It ws worth a experiment as it tasted good . Even though pizza did not hv pizza flavour but sev Puri tasted like real
Simple non fussy place with a limited menu of offering Maharashtrian snacks n few food items.. the Misal is very good.. I have also tried a few of their rice items such as methkut rice... very nice...
"Very nice Maharashtriyan food
Pls visit that place again and again.misal pav,Kanda bhaki,amboli,piyush,batata vada,shabu Dana vada,masale bhat etc likes every time."
Great place for local food. Tried a variety of dishes. All were well cooked. Puran palli was awesome. Service is quick and the restaurant is light on pocket.
"With snobby waiters this little place serves maharashtran snacks n stuff like puri bhaji n samosa too. Taste is just ok...very pricey for Wat they actually serve. It's just basic street food with ting of pride.
Pooran poli is recommended and maybe some dry snacks like chakli etc..."
Taste is too good...must try usal with puri....also try misal pav....pedhe (sweet cakes) also yummy...batata wada also good...thalipeeth ok ok...
Too costly for a street food place. An onion bhaji plate will cost you Rs. 40/- which is not at all justifiable. Menu is limited but food is good.
