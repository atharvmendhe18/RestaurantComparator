"One of the best place in Ghatkopar to get the Kori ghasi that too with neer dosa, it was very fulfilling for us. The main thing its not even costly, appropriately cost for two people. The rest we had the chicken item which was delicious in taste. Service wise the place is good. I liked the ambiance of the place. I will definitely visit this place again for Kori ghasi with neer dosa, that's on my chart now."
"The gorgeous ambiance of the spice court was the least of its good qualities

"Spice court is a good place to have chill time. This place is not so far from station. The theme and ambiance is good one
We tried manchow soup, Achari aloo as an appetizer. Tandoori aloo was lovely. Flavor was amazing.
Orange cranberry punch, mocktail is what we tried. It was little sweet in taste
For mains we had veg dum biriyani, boondi raita. Best combination and it was full of flavors.
At the end we had brownie with icecream. Brownie was soft and fresh.
Overall nice experience.
