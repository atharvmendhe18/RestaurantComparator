Review
"Initially having set out on treating ourselves to shiro, Aoi happened by chance as it was the only sushi place around which did not need reservations on a Sunday afternoon. Now as we were looking for a sumptuous lunch spread surrounded by Japanese decor, we were reluctant to go here.
This place surprised us. Firstly the ambience. They have tried to create a beautiful space by making paper birds with tiny lights hanging from the ceiling. The walls are covered with mangiamo art and they even have a few naruto comics for sale. However despite all this, the place looks kinda sad at least in the afternoon. I got a feeling that this would be a better place to visit post sunset.
Where I was...read more"
"Loved the Rainbow Sushi, the Skewers, the Fried Rice and Ramen.

The Chocolate Sushi was a nice innovation.

The food is great but a wee bit pricey for a place without a bar license."
"Aoi is a hidden gem in bandra. A must find and go place. It is away from the bandra chaos but yet very close to get there.
Its small and cute, the decor very chic and artsy. It has warm welcoming feel to it. Super clean, the min to enter, the kitchen is in full view and is extremely well maintained the staff well groomed.
The staff is attentive and well versed with the menu, we ate the Spicy Tuna Inside out Uramaki roll, this was fresh zingy and yum. We also had the miso soup one of the best I have tasted in Bombay so far. We ordered the chicken/banana leaf dumpling which was nice. The tasty food encouraged us to order more and we tried the Red curry - Temari which was divine and...read more"
"A torrid affair that refuses to die down

And it was lust at first bite. A torrid affair that refuses to die down. I have pledged my eternal love to Aoi now. A small charming quaint eatery on the corner street of Bandra is unassuming it its décor. But the food packs a power punch. Before I weave the food stories here, I must mention the staff is exemplary. Rarely do I see this kind of attentiveness from restaurant staff. SUSHIIIIII and well add that it is not burning a hole in my pocket. Maki Salsa is my favorite for the reason I am allergic to fish and they stopped serving Ham Sushi some time back. I never knew I could fall in love with Bacon fries the way I did on my very first bite....read more"
"It took a little navigation on the GPS..but once we got there..Aoi proved to be totally worth the wait...coming from the management of the tried and tested Lemon Leaf (nee Lemon Grass), Aoi had been on the gourmet wish list since a while.

It proved to be the perfect lunch destination on a lazy Saturday afternoon.
What greets you first is the warm decor and the origami birds that transport you to samurai land. The soft oriental music sets the tone for the gastronomical journey to follow.

The menu can flummox the uninitiated so be sure to consult the captain..or you may end up ordering too little..or maybe too more

We started off with the shitake mushroom and onion jam sushi..fresh...read more"
"It was hard to imagine there would be a beautiful little Japanese restaurant at the end of a residential road, or so we thought when we navigated through GPS to locate Aoi last night. For the first 15 minutes, we were the only ones in the restaurant and I wondered if that meant the food isn't so great, after all. When my miso soup arrived, I knew I was wrong. I absolutely loved the seaweed and finely diced tofu bits!
The challenges of sushi are formidable. If it isn’t rolled properly, if it isn’t stuffed with crisp tempura/fresh vegetables, if the rice is cooked too much or too little, if the seasoning isn't right, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, sushi has a...read more"
"I love Aoi as it is a great option for sushi without burning a hole in your pocket. It's a tiny place, but the decor is great and one can sit here without being disturbed or feeling the need to rush through a meal. 

They don't serve alcohol but I liked their Mandrin Mojito and Ginger and Apple Lemonade.

I can only talk about the vegetarian options so here goes: Had the Roasted Pepper, Pesto and Philly Cream Cheese Nigiri, Yum Yum Maki with Shitake and Onion jam, the veg Udon noodles, all of which were great.

Was wondering how their signature Chocolate Sushi would be... it was great! Kept the chocoholic in me satisfied.

The staff is quite helpful too. I really like the place."
"If I'm in the area (and it is quite often) or for my forever Sushi craving, I end up at Aoi. Have been coming here since 2013 and I've never been disappointed except for the fact that the size of the sushi has been slowing decreasing.
Compared to other Japanese places it is definitely VFM."
"Tasting menus are like speed dating. This is a stretched analogy as I have never been speed dating and most probably you haven't either.... But it sounds like fun doesn't it?
I came across a great deal on gourmetiup for a SEVEN course tasting meal at Aoi. When we reached there I was filled with trepidation which is a fancy way of saying the facade looked shady and bleh. The interiors were only a notch better... Some manga and burlap cranes punctuated the walls and ceiling. The menu was presented to and it looked promising...
The first course was between cucumber mojito and Japanese tea. My friend and I both had the sniffles so we opted for tea. Then proceeded to the soup, the seafood...read more"
"Aoi is a small Japanese joint on bandstand. Although small the quality of the food is incredible. The interior decor, although not traditionally japanese, does have a sense of magic to it. The food is authentic japanese cuisine, something which is a little difficult to find in Bombay these days. The katsu chicken curry and the maki rolls are an absolute delight, paired with the variety of soup bowls results in a gobsmacking meal. As we all know, no meal is complete without dessert, the chocolate sushi platter (something we got off the menu) is recommended. I look forward to going back there immediately after I leave :D"
My favorite vegan sushi place in town! Their Bombay Rush and Paris have crunchy tempura veggies in them and are served with the most interesting sauces. Outside the sushi menu their hot and spicy stir fried ramen is too die for. Love love love!
"Love their Bento boxes and the view to the kitchen :D
Keep up the good work, sushi n tempuras ... 
Japanese food lovers must try this once,  I'm passionate about culinary art  and  .. quite inspired by their food ;D"
"Good place for a quiet catch up. Amazing dishes. Beautiful service.
Miso and Ginger flavored chicken tacos highly recommended!
2nd priority would be Shitake mushroom sushi."
"When you gotta go you gotta go! Lol that's what happens when sushi pangs hit you! And sometimes you don't want to spend a bomb to satisfy those pangs. If you can relate to what I am saying then AOI is the place you should head out to!

Located near a market. You kind of have second thoughts going in! But as this was not my first time I was at ease and knew what lay in wait. The space has a nice coffee shop gone japanese like one of those bubble tea joints. The Manga paintings are gone :-( but in the hindsight the interior does look a little more professional now!

Straight to the food. No alcohol here! So no distraction. We ordered the spicy tuna hiramaki straight away! Very good! We...read more"
The quality seems to have gone down. ordered some veg sushi for home delivery - most of the sushi started opening up and didnt taste too good. its a shame - the place used to be really good before. the prices have also gone up considerably. singkong would be a much better option
"Soo damn good. The word that pops up, finding the place was a task as its almoat unnoticeable being at a turn with a small board. Entering the place youre bound to think, wow...its actually bigger than you can expect. Have your seat, look around, look above, look sideways...the ambience is good, the decor is refreshing, the staff is patient & friendly, the prices are justified, the crowd is young & amazing, the vibe is happy & very good, the service is good (not confuse with fast), the food is super good (if you know or actually like japanese food), ita what you need & nees to go a couple of times before you dont want sushi (which wont happen).

We ordered for a particular dish with rice...read more"
"I have been there... truly speaking, its too far from authentic sushi !!!! The Bad - sea weed layer is pathetic... Platter is not at all good... and its higly indianised version of Japanese food... Not at all japenese !

The Good - Only Ambience and Service is good... sushi is disaster.."
"The place boasts of good Japanese food. Although its a fine dine restaurant but the location of the restaurant and the staff doesnt level up to the buzz created. 

We tried the AOI special crispy soba and seaweed salad which was very fresh and colorful along with the Cucumber Mojito which was too sweet for my liking. The Veg Miso Soup and the Seafood bisque were nice and had a lot of veggies in it. #Tofu was extremely soft and almost melted in the mouth. 

For appetiser we tried the Three mushroom yaki, spinach and cream cheese wonton, tofu tacos. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection (i am not a big mushroom fan) but the wonton was hard and was diffcult to bite into. The tofu tacos...read more"
"I have been a sushi/sashimi fan for close to 20 years now and found myself craving sushi one Saturday night. I scanned my options on Zomato and found Aoi in my neighborhood.
It took me a while to find the place - primarily because the signage was so small and street lighting so negligible but once inside I was immediately seated (even though I was single - with minimum fuss which for a single diner in Bombay nowadays, is a rarity).

Checked out the menu and settled or the large sushi platter which showed up in about 10 minutes. Before that I had a jasmine tea which I didn't like much - just tasted like hot water but eh - the sushi more than made up for that.
It was tasty, the fish was...read more"
"Took to the link to head to the other side of town for some Japanese food and found ourselves at Aoi, a small place tucked in a corner close to Bandstand.

We had gone for the Gourmet it Up offer so we were saved from the task of ordering. However, I did manage to scan the menue. At 400-500 rupees a dish, you can say that Aoi isn't the most expensive of options for Japanese cuisine in the city.

Now straight to the food! For drinks we ordered the cucumber mojitos and gimanchi tea. Both refreshing and flavorful. To start off with we ordered some Miso and bisque. While the bisque was slightly Indianised with its spices, the Miso was delicious. From there we moved on to the salad: salmon...read more"
"Sushi Lovers in Mumbai , this is the place to be. Been here twice and absolutely love the food ,ambience and the service here. A little on the higher side wrt Prices , but hey the entire experience definitely makes up for it. For Veg guys , their veg sushies are also awesome. Tried the shitake Mushroom Sushi this time around and it was absolutely amazing.

One of the best places to eat for sushi lovers definitely!!"
"While this is definitely not 100 % authentic, it's tasty, feel good japanese. Lovely flavours, beautiful food and fantastic service. I can't stress enough on how good the service is - recommend you ask the maitre'd for their suggestion."
If you are a sushi lover u should try this place.. also liked their grilled chicken breast in white mizo glaze.. though its a small place located at a corner of a dull lane in bandra..it surely gets thumbs up for the ambience.. would like to visit this place again..
"Ambience- The place is elegant and artistic. Interiors done very well and makes you feel lively. decent place for a date or with a group of friends.

Food- we ordered Sushi first as recommended by the staff. Though i didnt like Sushi i had tried before at some other place, i really loved the one i had here. you should explore the food here and the staff will assist you to try new Japanese dishes.
Service - they make you feel royal with their service. The staff will recommend you with their best Japanese dishes as well as assist you with the sausages and spices to add on the dishes. he will help you with the chopsticks too.

Cost- costly but worth
Parking- Valet parking available"
"Having heard so much about the restaurant and having gone all the way to the burbs once earlier and not being able to dine here along with my love for sushi, I was way too eager to try Aoi (pronounced aa-vi). Its located right after the reclamation and is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it restaurant. Well very honestly the place was way smaller than my expectation.

We went at a normal lunch hour and were surprisingly the only ones there. The restaurant is small and has really pretty looking lighted origami birds and colourful paintings on the wall. The Japanese feel coming from the restaurant is bang on! Having heard all positive reviews for this place we couldn’t wait to get our taste buds...read more"
"A great for affordable sushi at very high quality and standards. If you're a sushi lover you know that sushi is synonymous to a wallet breaking experience. When you leave Aoi, you're not gonna wanna kill yourself or take out another mortgage to survive the month... Rather you'll wanna go home and relax and savour the meal you just had! A must visit for all sushi lovers!!!"
"Delicious. Always. 

I love Aoi and their ever name changing ""Lemon Grass"". 
I will always give them good reviews because they know how to make good food!"
"Aoi - The only place, you start with a sushi and end with a sushi!!

FIRST THE FOOD:
If you love Sushi.. You MUST visit Aoi. Their Sushi Platter offers a wide variety and is amazing to gorge on!
For foodies like my friends and I... we dont just stop at the Platter... There is the Smoked Salmon & Seaweed Appetiser to try out!!
Now, I am a fan of Bacon, so the BACON WRAPPED PRAWNS are a must try...!!
But wait... you must save some space for the amazing.. yummy.. delicious..ok am drooling on my laptop.. CHOCOLATE SUSHI... :)
Disappointment: Bacon Fries... All fries and no bacon :'(

Located in the middle of nowhere.. since I do not know Bandra much.. people around know the place...read more"
"This little quaint place, replacing two former quaint little places before it, dishes out food that is as Japanese as terrible chole can be, well food from Nippon. The missus and I, both being cuckoo about food from the Rising Sun, tooled round on a Gourmet It Up booking. And barring a bisque, which is not Jap, mind you, the rest of the chow was some of the worst food we have ever had, let alone the worst Japanese food. The house menu does give you a bit of warning with a line straight from Looney Tunes; drivel about Japanese food not being Japanese food. Blah and some note blah. As for the food, the rice for the sushi was dry, insipid and starchy. All three characteristics of terrible...read more"
"This restaurant is at a place where you will never expect a restaurant to be. The first time you get there, you are sure to drive by. But once your in, its liked you found a gem. :D

Thanks to Aoi, Japanese food is no longer about making a huge hole in your pocket. This tiny place lives up to authentic Japanese and also adds its new take on Sushi. And if Japanese is what your fond of..this is the right place to be :)

I have been here thrice, and tried their various sushi. Dont remember all, but I have never been disappointed yet
1.. Crabmeat and Chive Gunkan. 3/5
2.. Prawn tempura Maki: 5/5. MUST TRY. It had this yummy prawn tempura crunch in the center. This one is my favorite!! :D And...read more"
"This small little restaurant can truly surprise you. I loved each dish i tried. From sushi to rice to soup, everything was great. I am however deducting 0.5 for the small quantity per plate and for the mocktail which could have been better. Overall, it is a great place to have some Japanese food and I'm sure most of you will love it"
"This is a very small outlet, with max seating capacity of thirty people.. The ambience is calm, with anime on the walls and lighted origami birds hanging from the ceiling.. Fell in love with the decor..
The food, needless to say was brilliant ! our server as well as the host were extremely warm and inquired about our experience at every course. It was a very well timed meal allowing us enough time between courses without being rushed through the experience. The tea, Sushi Platter, appetizers and the Miso glaze were the highlights of the meal !
Indianized or Chinese version of Japanese, it's prefect for first timers for Japanese cuisine like me!
Loved it every bit!"
"Loved the restaurant and their hospitality.
Food is super, my first experience of real sushi so have nothing to measure it against but was super happy.
Can't miss their blueberry tea - it's perfect and comforting. Will definitely go again :)"
"Today's experience at Aoi must rank as one of my worst dining out experiences. First the pluses, good service, pork donburi was tasty and the jalapeno beef bulgoki was not bad. Now on to the negatives -- the sushi was awful. We ordered the Aoi non veg sushi platter which comprised of 4 types of sushi, 3 of which were average and 1 which was too stale to be cooked let alone served raw. The tea was poured before it could steep enough and the mandarin red velvet cake was soggy. We're not coming back. Maybe we ordered the wrong things judging by the great reviews here. One advice, if you're used to authentic sushi stay clear of what they serve here."
"My first time Sushi and I was taken to a whole new world.

I quite enjoyed the food but the 3.5 rating is for being denied the table we wanted (and which was empty the whole time we were there). That is rude.

Now the food, oh, so good.

We ordered the fires and the bacon fries, both well made served with excellent dip.

The Prawns tempura sushi was wow, simply superb. We also ordered the sea food dimsums which were perfect and lovely.
We moved to hot and spicy ramen noodles which was very hot and spicy. Tasted well but the cuisine shifted to Chinese.

We had Houjicha tea (lovely) and ended with chocolate sushi which was the show stealer. We paid 2.3k for two for the experience of 7...read more"
Tried this place with a gourmet it up coupon. It was a 10 course meal. And although im very wary of these course meals (cos of the limited portions and ofcourse the fact that they throw in a lot of salad/leafy things) this one was pretty good. Not only was I full at the end of the meal but the food was pretty phenomenal. I particularly liked the sushi and a dish whose name I cannot remember but it was kinda like a breaded fried chicken with a coconut gravy over it. Yum. Dammit now I want sushi.
"Love the neighbour-hoody feel of the place. The interesting paintings, the kitschy paper birds lamps & the general unpretentious vibe made made me feel like I was at one of many such local-only-favourite places in New York or SF.
It was nice to get good food in Bandra on a Saturday night without feeling the need to dress up.

We were taken here by a couple of foodie friends so were pretty sure we'd love the food, but the setup of the place was a nice surprise.

Down to the food -- their experiments with sushi is top drawer. Loved the dashes of pesto on one, the Panko crumbs on another. The platter is the way to go for sure. The steamed dumplings with the mushroom broth were...read more"
"To be honest the place a great . I am just not a fan of modern sauces in sushi. Most of the sushi has mayo , chitpotle or hollandaise. It's nice to get those twist on sushi . It's not for me . I am a sushi lover . I wish it was found as easy and affordable as you get abroad ."
We heart the improvised food quality and experience at Aoi. Been there one too many times but this time .... the food was scrumptious and light. We ordered the Veg Sushi Platter and The stuffed Chiken with Mushroom. Must try the chocolate sushi. Point 5 extra for service.
"Aoi is a place I want tucked away within a 5min walking radius of my house (if it isn't too much to ask).Its a simple Sushi joint that has memorable food and comfortable experience. I am not sure if its the off-the-beaten-path location but the place is always occupied but NEVER crowded or overwhelmed enough to not welcome you in. Either way, like at Kofuku, I enjoy sitting at the bar table seating facing the kitchen and watching the process. I have been there 3-4 times I suppose. Once used a pre-set dinner menu offer as well. Each time the food was delightful, extremely light and well balanced and proportioned. The spare time in between was spent drinking tea and fresh ginger-lemon and...read more"
"The place is really small and not very easy to find. They have valet parking, which is helpful. The food is great. Loved the bacon wrapped prawns and the chicken and mushroom dumplings. And it's very reasonably priced as compared to other restaurants that offer Japanese cuisine."
"Had a wonderful experience. They have good number of choices in their menu, I tried their veg Chicago sushi which was yummy. Had such a delicious sushi after very long time..."
Super sushi! To start with. The sushi platter is a must. The place borders on claustrophobic. The miso soup and Japanese pizzas are so so.
It's quite a small place but well lit and designed. The origami hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. The sushi was fairly decent. 1500 for 12 pieces of 4 different rolls on a large dish didn't felt bare. But the Korean food was almost like eating spicy Chinese food from the roadside. Presentation of the food was great. Wish the food tasted as good as it looked.
"The Food here is amazing! I had been here on the 1st of August with a friend... And well, the picture attached with this review could do the talking...!"
"A small lil place near mount Mary.. As silent n as peaceful as mount Mary... But delicious food.. Loved the sushi's n their spicy kimchi soup.. N for ppl whu say veg sushi's Dnt taste good, plz visit Aoi!!!! N yaa a very friendly staff to assist n help in case needed."
"A cute little place with surreal Japanese décor. Tried a bit of their handy menu and the only worthwhile mention is of their Katsu curry. Although the curry in question was limited in quantity and had to ask for a refill. But overall well executed in terms of taste and preparations.Nothing much to write about the rest of the orders.Surely, will visit again to try their well crafted Sushi platter."
"Excellent Japanese food!
Lovely little place with a cute decor like you're in a teenage Japanese girls room with origami et all
Started off with chicken dumplings
Then offcourse the mega sushi plattet which had great variety
The sushi was super
We then ordered the grilled chicken in garlic soy with crispy seaweed mash!!!
Omg it was excellent what a great meal
Fresh sea food
Good service
Delicious food
What else do you need! Go now!"
"Aoi serves one of the yummiest sushi rolls in Mumbai. Its a sweet little space with few tables, so prior reservation recommended. They have a great menu, and everything in there is worth trying! All time favourite is their salmon salad and prawn tempura. Dips and dressings served along compliment the food very well. And omg that mandarin red velvet cake!! Never heard of it before, but it is sooo good. It WILL disappear from the plate in a minute's time!"
"I wanted to try out new places in Bandra and Aoi had got good reviews. The reviews had warned me that this place is small...but boy is this place small! For such a small place, their prices are high enough. It is very difficult to sit comfortably here and relax. And though the food is good, it isn't better than what you might get at any other Japanese place.

I love sushi and I liked their sushi too...but it is expensive and there is no wow factor. The chicken dimsums were nice too."
"OMG!!! What can I say about this place. My friend is a huge fan of Japanese cuisine and she suggested we go here. I was a Japanese cuisine virgin and was about to get my cherry popped! Th first thing you notice once you get there is the nice collection of Manga and Anime Collectibles (Although Kenny from South Park was not an Anime Character). The origami cranes hung on the ceiling and the sakura painted on the wall gives the place a nice touch. We ordered the Chef's Signature Mega Sushi Platter, and let me tell ya'll, it was fabulous. I never thought I could fall in love this fast. It was mind blowing!!! After the sushi platter, we ordered for dessert. The assorted platter over there as...read more"
"When I first came across the name ""AOI"" I thought of it to be a rather unfamiliar name for a restaurant, but it did catch my fancy nonetheless. A quick Google search gave me no fixed answers to the mystery surrounding this three lettered Japanese word. A few sites however mentioned it being used as a prefix for various plants in Japan as well as a Festival and also Wild Ginger. Now what seems true if someone holds an answer to that. Not being an ardent fan of Japanese food in particular I never thought of giving this place a try, however was insisted upon by a friend of mine based on the great ratings and reviews that the place has garnered. Hence decided to see in person what all the...read more"

we were three of us. we ordered the korean style lettuce wrap - delicious but spicy the 18 piece veg sushi platter - mouth watering, beautifully crafted. tempura were so crispy and well made....it was worth the price 
then we ordered two portions of Aoi style katsu curry - this one is delicious and filling. we ordered 2 portions because it was so good.

"My first experience with the coveted Sushi, Japan's one of many gifts to the world!

This is more of a learning experience than an actual review, as I really don't have much knowledge about most of Japanese cuisine or what to expect from a plate.

Two of my friends and I went to this place on a Sunday evening. Aoi is located at a cozy, nondescript corner behind Mount Mary's Church. It's a small place with only about 5-6 tables, but what they lacked in space, they made it up well in terms of service and quality.

We ordered an Aoi sushi platter. The waiter was patient enough to explain the dishes to us, and tailor-made our order for a platter consisting of two kinds of rolls- maki and...read more"
"I just keep going back to this place time and again. A quaint little place tucked in the bylanes of bandra, it offers distinctive Japanese food. Guess there was a special menu, so don't remember a couple of names from the menu. But few things that were noteworthy were chicken consommé with Parmesan croute, wakame and nori, wok tossed kimchi and seafood dumpling and my all time favourite is AOI style Katsu curry. This place is a MUST visit!"
"Aoi is a small little place, located at the end of hill road.
Our start wasn't too great, as their valet had not come yet and I had to find parking and park my car myself!
We had come with the intention of just having the different types of sushi available here!
There 4 types of sushi available:

Urmaki: in this roll, the seaweed and toppings are on the inner side of the rice. We ordered the avocado urmaki. It was amazing, my favourite for the day. But I really like avocados so my opinion may be biased

Maki: This one is made with seaweed outside the rice and fillings in the centre! I generally prefer the maki over this. We called for an asparagus maki. The fried asparagus gave the dish...read more"
My first tryst with sushi happened to be in this small restraunt nestled in an offbeat location in bandra.Went by the waiter's reco's....while ordering. Just tried a couple of sushi's....prawns maki and nigiri salmon. Well...honestly i didnt like the taste of it at all...as compared to the way sushi looks. Maybe we need to explore this cuisene more before concluding on this restaurant and japenese cuisene......would like to end with ....i will be back....
It's a very small joint in bandra but it serves very good sushi. . We had order spicy Kimchi soup which was amazing n sushi mega platter which was simply awesome.. lastly we had ordered AIO katsu curry which was outstanding you can't just miss.. I did not like chocolate sushi though he gave us as a complementary dish at last.. I loved the origami craft done on ceiling..
"One of the best restaurant i.hv visited. Situated in the heart of the city Aoi is a.place where one can have sum actualy good food. Yes if u r a vegiterian then u can avoid the place as there are less variety but i wanted to visit this place as.had heard lot abt the place. Well the ambience is preety good , good crowd , good atmosphere all around. I and my pal jus orderd a veg curry and a veg burger and 2 juices. And yes these 3 items didnt disapointed us. It was upto the mark. I m.happy i visited this place and yes it deserves zomato's 4.1 rating. :)"
One of the best restaurants I've been to yet. Short on space like many Mumbai eating establishments but more than makes up for it with the quality of food. Be it the Korean beef or the fried rice or the udon noodles. Totally worth it.
"1. Location - Firstly the location is in very remote area of Bandra bandstand.... If a new person comes then it's very difficult for him / her to find... Since proper landmark or some notice boards need to placed on the main road... New customers should avoid visiting the place on sunday... Go on weekdays... Valet is available... So at least car park is settled... Getting cab is difficult...

2. Food - Food @ Aoi is amazing... Only thing needed is proper guidance and proper selection.... Korean rolls and tomato tofu soup is good in starters.... Sushi and kotsu curry rice is good in main course... Avoid chocolate sushi desert..

3. Ambiance - Its a small resto with a sitting capacity...read more"
"Sunday morning means PS3 morning. WWE, MK IX, FIFA were played in full power. After beating each other in these games, me and my evil twin decided to head to Aoi. The place was quite cold. Beautiful origami art on the ceiling. Got a good view table.

Started with soups. The Miso soup with siken tofu and seaweed - Superb. Spicy Khimchi Soup - Just alright. So we called for the Shitake Mushroom with Thyme flavored cheese from the NIGIRI section. Very nicely made. Good flavor of thyme.
Next up was the Chicago which was also made really nice. It kinda went well with the soup. The taste of all the food so far was a monopoly.

Then my friend ordered the Bacon wraped prawns, maple glazed and...read more"
"Loving the fact that Japanese food culture is gradually seeping into the city's life style. Enjoyed the sushi platter and (surprisingly) the veal, which was perfectly done, not chewy, tender to bit into and u could taste the light flavors of d ingredients. The noodles also were well appreciated but I thought it had a little Indian touch to it.. Extra had of masala (even if the masala meant soya n tomato puree). BUT tooo small a place, long waiting n can't relook the portion sizes ( too small). I guess that is what you call successful Fine Dining."
"Visited this restaurant on the weekend and we were looking forward to trying sushi for a while now.
Since we were new to it (having tried it a couple of times before), we tried the recommended Aoi sushi platter (non-veg). It comes with 12 pieces (4 types of sushi, 3 pieces each) which is appropriate for 3 people. The 4 types were one each of prawn, crab-meat, tuna and Salmon. Personally liked the crab one the most.

I Guess they don't server alcohol, but the mocktail menu was also interesting and I enjoyed the Aoi breezer. We ended the meal with a Chicken with black bean - big grill bowl which was also very tasty, perhaps slightly strong on the soya.

"Go here for the sushi surely. Great variety and good taste! The other stuff was not bad but not very great either. And it would have helped if the place didn't smell little ""detergenty"" with an overkill of air freshener. But if you are a lover of sushi you can overlook all this and still go and have the non veg sushi platter when you do."
"Aoi... We went there for dinner. I like Japanese food. I had Japanese food in London for the first time and instantly loved it. So we set expectations we went there. Ginger lemonade was good. They have different options in mock tails and those are nice. Verity of appetizer, starters, soup and main course. I loved main course most. It was tasty and worthy for money. But I did not liked starters. We had ordered for momos and chicken skewers. Cover of momo was chewy and chicken inside was hard. Sadly a deep was not provided with momos. BBQ chicken skewers were lil burnt. Main course was nice but curry was less. They re fill it though. Over all it was good and worth for money. Not to forget...read more"
"Aoi is a small eatery near Chapel road in Bandra west, which does not strike as one you would absolutely adore, at first sight.
The entrance is manned lazily by a singular guard, who would rather be a welcome sight at a sleaze bar.
Upon entering this small place, you are welcomed by birds crafted from paper hanging by the dozens on the ceiling. Clusters of them. And I quite liked that! The birds lend to the strangely vague Japanese atmosphere there, what with the addition of the anime styled paintings of bonny lasses. The aesthetics of the place won't completely satisfy you.

Even if you're a hard core carnivore you must try the Chicago maki rolls. It's to die for. I've visited this place with different friends with varied palates and they all swear by it. Rest of the menu is great too. The staff is polite and the ambience is cosy. Love it.
"Naah nothing authentic about this place. We went in for the tasting menu, and honestly the food is at best mediocre.. Asked for a replacement on stale fish, ""it's the best we have sir"" tort came the reply please try our chicken instead..

Huh??"
"I found Aoi via Gourmet it up and have reviewed that experience in detail on the blog ( http://eatslowlyplz.tumblr.com/post/78217109166/aoi-the-rise-and-rise-of-casual-asian-dining ) But this review is the time we wen't back and tried everything else.

The Miso Soup is perfect. Don't start with anything else. Really. Though the Chicken Consomme is also nice.

The Sushi is inventive. Sadly a lot of reviews on Sushi places haven't even tried the Sushi. I promise - I ate each one of the sushi offerings (this is a combined review of multiple visits :) The Salmon and Tune Nigiri is wonderful, The Gukan - try the smoked salmon and also the crabmeat. The Spicy Tuna maki is different - and the...read more"

"Upon stepping into this restaurant, you might feel a little hesitant because it's fairly small, and not very fancy looking. But give it a chance, because it's probably among the best Japanese food I've eaten in the city!

Food: 5/5
They have a very interesting menu, quite different from what you'd normally see in a Japanese restaurant.
All the food we ordered was brilliant. It tasted superb, and everything was really fresh. Presentation was great, too. We ordered:
• Korean style lettuce wraps with corn, asparagus, water-chestnuts, and nam-jim sauce
• The hearty broth
• Smoked salmon and seaweed salad dressed in lemon miso cream
• The 12-piece non-vegetarian sushi platter
•...read more"
Had really nice pad thai here the first time round. Fresh crunchy ingredients. Second time round it was missing the freshness but Aoi still qualifies as a favourite.
The best Jap food in town. Small & cozy restaurant. Nice decor & ambience. Spotted Minisha Lamba dining here today.
"We were looking for a Sunday Dimsum lunch and after doing all the research thanks to Gourmet It Up we got reservations at AOI, no Dimsums but a Japanese Tasting 8 Course meal. Wait…. Japanese… Vegetarian… 8 Courses… now how is that even possible? Japanese are hard core meat eaters, how would they do 8 vegetarian japanese courses!!! Aoi surprises us, course after course after course. WOW!

Aoi tucked in a small corner of Bandra close to Mt Mary Church, this eatery is so tiny it seats about 30 people max. My companion wondered what kind of a meal would we be served here, the place is so tiny. She gave me ‘I told you so” grin, but after all the reviews I had read I stood my...read more"
Sushi lovers.. This is the place to eat in bandra...
"Even though at first glance the restaurant's look underwhelms, the sushi menu starts looking promising, and by the time you are savoring the first sushi, it feels worth it! It was the first time I've had crunchy sushi (vegetarian)... it was unique! Loved the miso soup (it is an acquired taste) which had noodles and seaweed. The udon noodle with aoi special sauce was just the right tanginess! Only the dessert (I had the green tea cheesecake) was disappointing. Highly recommend for Japanese food lovers!"
"Normally I don't like japanese food but this place seems to have tweaked the cuisine to suit Indian taste buds. I always respect that. When in Rome do as the Romans do I say. Very cozy small place. The mushroom and cheese dimsum had some mind blowing sauce which wasn't present in its chicken counterpart. The chef's sushi platter showcases the various vegetarian sushi available.... About 18 pieces 3 of each type. Other dishes to try out are the katsu curry, yaki tori, rock corn tempura, tofu tacos. Staff is extremely polite and gave good recommendations. Ambience is quite nice with origami lights and an open kitchen. Must try for a first time introduction to Japanese cuisine."
"Cute, cosy place that offers great value for money. The staff is warm & friendly & knows the menu really well. The soba noodles were great. The tuna in the sushi was really fresh too.all in all it's a great place for a quick Japanese meal."
"The group that runs Lemon Grass and Aoi has quite a few amazing Asian joints.

Aoi, for me, is the crown jewel.

Very very nice comfy place with the ambience being very very well done. Even though it is a small location at the corner of a junction, when you sit inside, it feels really spacious.

They have quite a lot of variety on their menu.

Their Sushi platter brings to you the best of everything.

Try the spinach leaf appetizer. It is unexpectedly delicious with an explosion of flavor in every bite.

The Miso soup is very well made with a slight hint of cheesiness, which gives it a very different creamy feeling.

I will definitely be going to Aoi again. Not as expensive as other...read more"
"Culinary cultures often end up being embodied by a single icon that comes to epitomize it. Cast your mind’s eye to a cuisine of your choice and you will realize this is true. The Italians are Pizza, the Mexicans are Tacos, and so on. And if you cast your mind closer home, this adage holds equally true. Of course, what a culinary culture stands for might differ in your opinion and mine. That’s the beauty of being subjective.

But the one thing we can all agree on is that the Japanese are Sushi through and through.

This one connection though is so strong that most of don’t end up looking beyond Sushi when it comes to Japanese food. Food lovers we may be, but most of us are frankly...read more"
"It took me longer than expected to try out this place. To start with, we ordered the bacon wrapped prawn & Lox (smoked salmon, cream cheese & cucumber Uramaki). The bacon wrapped prawn was outstanding. The maple & honey glaze set it apart, making me want to go right back for more. The Lox was delicious too.
For the main course, we ordered
-The Tenderloin steak with vegetable fettucini, rice fries & bulgoki marinade; and
-The grill prawns with Japanese mustard & red chilly (a rice bowl with Chinese greens).

The steak was definitely one of the best I've had in Bombay, the sauce being delicious & unique, doing complete justice to the perfectly cooked steak. The rice bowl was really good...read more"
"Ok, so took us a while to find this place, which in a way was good as this really built our appetite. Nice cozy place with a few tables, however they made such a fuss when I called to make a reservation, saying they only take reservations at 8pm and 10pm.. none in between... odd, as they were pretty empty when we got there. Anyway, not too big a deal. The food was amazing... I recommend their crab and chive wrapped with cucumber sushi and their chocolate sushi that we had for dessert. Also, as a side note - their kitchen looked incredibly zen, clean and organized.. from where I was sitting anyway ;)"
Great Japanese food. The service is also top notch!
