"The restaurant has delivered egg pakoda instead of aaloo paratha‚Ä¶being a pure vegetarian, this has been an extremely scandalising experience for me‚Ä¶never expected such a thing‚Ä¶I tried eating the dal khichadi but it seems to have a similar taste‚Ä¶never ordering from aangan dhaba ever again!"

"we have ordered the food 2:16 pm and food delivered on 3""36 pm which was almost 1 and half hour .
food was already delayed and we have ordered egg biryani chicken kolhapuri with naan and roti.
No raita was served also there is no salad , no pickle , no papad.
no condiments were served along with food.
we have accepted the order as it was too late for lunch and my guests were waiting.

Butter chicken and butter naan were not as expected. Tasteless I will never order again
dal khichdi is tasteless there is no papad and no pickle and in chicken biryani is also not tasty. chicken crispy is good
