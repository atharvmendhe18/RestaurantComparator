Review
very few chicken pieces
""
The chicken pieces were too hard and rubber-like. The gravy was too spicy.
The rice smells very bad and we can't even eat it's that bad. The crispy is okish it's not that good but the bhel was awesome
Chicken lollipop was not great it was worst

"Triple Schezwan Rice was just average, the gravy was pathetic. Out of the four manchurian balls 3 taste sour and stale."
Poor quality stale food spoiled our dinner on important evening
"The quality of food is so low...lollypop was smelling so bad..as if it was old..and rotten. even a roadside Chinese is better than this. Hakka noodles, was normal noodles..very average taste. overall Horrible..we had to throw the entire food."
Didnâ€™t send cutlery. How do I eat? Should have sent a wooden spoon

Was lil dry today than usual. But still good
The food is too good with awesome taste and quality
